when i was younger i was fat but im hilarious so i was considered the funny friend over the years ive loss some weight but im no where to being what i consider thin i still feel uncomfortable at times wearing cropped shirts or lowwaisted jeans even though my friends say i look good i know im not ugly but i dont feel pretty my closest friends that im always around are feminine pretty while i guess im androgynous im so sick of not being anyones first choice and i cant even look at myself without feeling disgusted lol
im  m and still suck my thumb and honestly dont want to stop  as much as i also do  want to stop i do it in secret and thats why i prefer to sleep at my own place or sleep in my own bed so that i can basically suck my thumb i wonder if there are other adults who still suck their thumb and whether it gives them the comfort as it gives me also is there some sort of stigma attached to it i feel these days everything goesdoes thumb sucking fall into the acceptable category already
more than a year ago i went to my local grocery store to have a costume cake made i usually go to the bakery but i needed it done in  days  the bakery needs at least a week 

it was a very simple tier cake it was for my sons first birthday  the theme was mickey mouse i found a cake on google that i liked it was all baby blue with yellow borders  mickey  minnie figurines on top that was it i had to pay for half of the price up front which i did 

when i went to pick it up i was disappointed it was a different shade of blue only the bottom of the cake had the yellow border  no mickey mouse figurines 

after she handed me the cake she went back to work on something else i stayed there waiting for her to charge me the rest but she didnt thats when i realized that she thought i had already paid for everything as i was about to walk away she asked me if i needed anything else i was about to mention the charge but instead i said i needed the mickey toys for the cake she handed me a small bag w a mickey  minnie in it  i made a run for it 

about an hour later i got a call from them the first thing they said was the name of the store so i hung up they called me for the following  days but i never answered i think if they wouldve done the cake how i wanted it i wouldve done the right thing there but i just didnt 

i still feel really bad about it but its been so long so i dont think i can make it right by now the cake was  btw 
i recently graduated from grad school and have been struggling to find a job despite my efforts i havent received any offers

on linkedin i came across a discussion about companies making unrealistic demands for experience like requiring over five years of experience with chatgpt which has only been available for barely two years many people suggested that exaggerating or lying on a resume is acceptable as long as you can prove your expertise for instance claiming two years of experience is fine if you can meet the jobs requirements

as a recent graduate in chemical engineering i only have half a year of industry training with no job offers and only two months worth of savings left to cover my rent i was getting desperate i knew my academic training exceeded the job requirements so instead of listing half a year of work experience i claimed one year

since then ive started getting interviews but the guilt of lying has been overwhelming after a week i reverted my resume to reflect the truth i need to confess that lying was wrong and from now on i am committed to being honest
extreme remorse

i grew up with pets yeah you can probably tell where this is going but i want to come clean i wont go into too many details because thinking about it still makes me cry and it was extremely traumatising some of our pets were treated fairly but most lived in horrible conditions i love animals so much even as a child i knew how wrong it was to keep our rabbit as a loner in a cage that was not even double his size  an occurance that the rabbit wasnt the only victim off we never brought them to a vet either  in fact my mother used their suffering as a punishment for me yeah i didnt grow up in a nice environment and one of our rabbits was really sick he had an uri no need for a vet you could easily tell he had trouble breathing besides other things i begged my mother all she had to say was its just a rabbit itll pass the sickness not the rabbit spoiler alert it did not and i had to listen to it fight to breathe every night as his cage was set in my room uris in small pets are not pretty to listen to or to watch and mind you i did not necessarily want this rabbit it was just there one day when i came back from school but i got the responsibility later on i think i was  i decided to relieve it from its suffering i couldnt sleep on my bed for days because i was scared id be damned and haunted by a higher entity  i now an adult still fear that and i cried so so much again i am an adult now i swore to myself id never do that again even though the first time i did it was also just out of pure guilt but i did a few months agoi have rats well  i had two rats one of them got extremely sick on a friday one day to another he was wobbling fell over fell from his climbing material disoriented trouble breathing no bowel control i hadnt noticed he had lost so much weight because he was the rat that never let me touch him much and during those  or  weeks i was extremely busy with work things so i couldnt handle them a lot either anyway im not trying to make excuses it was my neglect i know that i put him out of his misery myself as well as no vet emergency exotic pet vets do not exist where i live also a mistake of mine was open during that time and i was not able to bear to see him suffer through the weekend when he wasnt even able to walk properly i did my research and put him down in the most humane way i had access to okay now i have  rat left he seemed fine until a few days ago same symptoms as the first rat same circumstances  and not even money available  choices pray and hope which has never helped anybody or same fate as the other rat
with that came the fact that besides the neurological signs there are circumstantial problems as well that do not have anything to do with his health and this is where i was selfish for the first time i chose the latter this was the first time i didnt necessarily need to relieve him maybe i couldve waited but i have no money currently because of unfortunate events out of my own control this is the death i feel most guilty about and this might be the one that  if hell and heaven exists  i will end up burning for i never hit an animal i never kicked yelled  at one i cried when i cut a rainworm in half to test the myth of both halves of it living i tear up when i accidentally step on snails i swear i am no monster at least i dont hope i am i am so sorry i really am

i thought about confessing this to a priest or my therapist but im scared that maybe i am just a monster maybe rightfully so

edit i just want to say to everyone who commented thank you even though the guilt will definitely follow me to the grave i do feel a bit better thank you
when i was a kid i was super awkward and had no friends when i got into high school all the friends i had previously spent time with had moved away and i had to make a whole new group of friends which really sucked  because i didnt make friends well i had to come up with a cool story so that people would like me so i told everyone i was fully color blind people would ask me what color things were and id just say a random color and when people asked like how i matched clothes and stuff i always told them that i guessed based on the shades of grey the good part about it all was i never got graded on color accuracy on any project i ever did the bad part was that it got a lot of other people in trouble because they were kind mean i had a science partner that scratched the colors off the table colored pencils just to make it impossible for me to do the project we were doing i got to use my notes for that science final because i wasnt able to use a color coded map even now if i see someone from high school theyll laugh and ask me what color something is and i just laugh it off i kinda feel bad looking back now but its too late to tell the truth 
heres the deal about five years ago i started dating this girl who was crazy about seafood im talking she lived for shrimp crab lobster you name it the problem was i really hated shellfish just the smell made me gag but i wanted to impress her so i told her i was allergic to shellfish at first it seemed harmless she was super understanding and made sure we never went to seafood places

fast forward a couple of years were still together and my allergy has become this huge deal her family knows our friends know even my coworkers know theyve all been so considerate and careful about it and i feel like the biggest jerk ever i never thought it would go on this long but now im in too deep i feel like if i come clean everyone will hate me for lying all these years

i just needed to get this off my chest maybe ill tell her someday but for now im stuck living this lie

i know this seems stupid and pretty minor but i just hate lying
im  f and about a year ago a spiraled into a really horrible state of addiction 

it started with drinking i moved out for the first time and had a lot of free time i started drinking more bc i was bored 
the house started to creep me out keeping me up at night so i started drinking to fall asleep 
it spiraled over the course of  months ish to me drinking all hours of the day taking shots in the bathroom at work as soon as i woke up as soon as i did anything really i felt more drunk when i stopped drinking and it got really bad really fast i realized i couldnt not drink and at one point when i ran out of alcohol i started hallucinating so instead of addressing the problem i just kept on drinking 

my roommate stopped coming home because she said she was tired of watching me kill myself 
i didnt realize it at the time but i legitimately looked like i was dying 
and i was dying 

i dont remember anything leading up to it but i fell into a drug binge 
i stayed up doing coke with friends for days on end and when i ran out i would pop a xanax to help me sleep it off i slept for  days at one point according to my roommate 

one night after falling asleep after a coke binge no xanax involved i had two back to back seizures thank god my friend happened to be in my room it was a terrifying experience the most terrifying and traumatic experience of my life and i have such horrible ptsd from it but i never talk about it to anyone 

after i got back from the hospital i ruled out cocaine i dont remember how the next part started i just remember waking up and a week had gone by and i had been doing benzos and oxys for the entire time i dont remember a thing and its terrifying i know that the guy who was giving them to me had laced me with fentanyl which led to me overdosing and back in the hospital and ive been told that he also raped me 

i could go into a lot more detail but i ended up in rehab for a while followed by intensive outpatient treatment 

im  now and everyone thinks ive been sober since i mean to be fair i really have gotten my shit together i started my first year of college straight out of rehab and finished with good grades ive made good friends found a healthy relationship moved into a new apartment started teaching art classes and have genuinely been relatively happy 

but im not sober i was actually only sober for  weeks 

all i can say is that i feel i have control now but im sure i said the same thing then
im a guy  years old ive always had an addictive personality acquired it from my departed dads side of the family i believe i used to be a heavy marijuana user but managed to kick the habit for a week or two only to replace it with alcohol and a whole lot of it over the last couple of months ive been on a streak of drinking  beers shots a night whatevers available any day of the week and when i run out i take small calculated amounts from my mothers stash  a beer or  maybe a large glass of vodka or  replace with water a few days ago i was fired from my job of almost  years because i kept calling off since i was too hungover so far i havent told anyone that ive lost my job instead ive been doordashing during the hours that i normally would work in order to fund my habit and convince others that i still have a job no other reason as a  year old college student living at home i feel like an absolute scumbag im saying that because i know that everyone reading this is thinking the same thing i havent even bothered to apply for my junior year college courses i dont want to make this too long so ill just say if anyone is going throughhas gone through this situation id love to have a chat with you since i feel that i have no one in my life that i can talk to about this mess ive made for myself thank you to anyone who has read this far and good luck to you if youre in any situation similar to mine
it was an impulsive decision i was very hungry and my flight was about to take off i havent done anything like this since i was a teenager i feel guilty about it im not hungry anymore
i side swiped a parked car pulling into a parking spot while attempting to drop my truck off for a tuneup i panicked and left i dropped it off at another mechanic  i checked and saw the paint was chipped on their car and mine i feel terrible and im worried im going to get in trouble
this was  years ago at the heart of covid we were stuck online and only on zoom or google meet i used to send my friend the zoom link and code to join and troll the teacher i was a a student and the teacher liked me so she never suspected it was me he took it too far and ended up drawing dick and slurs in the zoom meeting there was a option where you can draw and everyone can see

this got serious quick the teacher wanted to know who it was but it didnt stop there my friend joined the google class under a fake account and trolled the teacher saying he was going to beat her up and r word her then assault her she ended up reporting it to the school for some reason they didnt check our school laptops 

but they ended up investigating and said it was a random student then he got expelled investigated by cops i dont know what happened and to be honest i didnt want to put suspicions  on myself but i saw the news article he was put in me and my friend never did it again 
i am a compulsive liar i never lie about big things but always the little things like what i ate for breakfast or what i did that day or ill add extra details to a story to make them sound better 

i dont know why i do this and i have tried to stop but i cant im now  and i have been doing this for as long as i can remember even when i am called out for my lies i will double down and lie some more lots of people think i am a bad liar because i am a bad liar when it comes to bigger stuff and i feel too bad lying to people but i lie to people all the time and they have no idea and im actually really good at the little lies 

edit i just want to add a lot of yall seem to think that i am not aware that it is wrong and like i want to be this way i am aware and i am trying to get better which is a part of the reason i made this post to start by admitting i have a problem and going from there also everyone saying get therapy i aint got no therapy money so unless you want to pay for my sessions give me better advice 
i got lunch the the cafe right near my work and im there almost every shift usually just for a drink but other days a full meal i came in expecting to get just a drink to go with my sandwich but they had their catfish combo for the first time in almost  months 

 it shouldve been  after tax that being said there was a relatively new girl on check out maybe here a week or two she struggled with everyone in line having to restart multiple times with each person by the time i got there i was running slim on time and needed to be back to work in  minutes she rung me up and the voided it because she rang my combo up then added a drink and fries had to correct her then she voided and tried again this time a combo but not the one i got had to correct her again and i was getting a bit frustrated because now i had  minutes to get back to work 

 the last time she rings me up just for the catfish  and i dont bother to correct her and just pay and leave before she realized it wasnt right either i hope she doesnt get in trouble and if i wasnt in a rush id stay to fix it but my job is nice enough to let us leave the site on the clock to go get food so i try not to push if i can i understand it isnt right thing to do and i know im not the only person whose done this today 
so basically i work in a shop and we have an old safe that the boss lost the key of and theres still some old enveloppe with money left the superior doesnt care about it anymore so my collegue told me we should get it theres a small hole but she never managed to get it it has been there for  years so she had her chance everyone did so i managed to get with some scotch and thread there was  i left around  inside and put it back just the way it was so if someone look inside with a flashlight they still see that it hasnt been touched so if my collegue or someone else manage to get it theres no proof it was me who took the money it could have been anyone working here 
but i mostly feel guilty about my collegue because we said we will share but i dont want to i need money and  is not much 
hello fellow redditors this happened a few years ago i had been on a drug called melanotan which is a tanning injection substance with a potent viagraesque side effect i was feeling quite ravenous not talking hunger i went on bumble and decided to find someone who could help me with my problem i matched with a cute woman in her s and she was on there looking for casual fun so it was perfect we exchanged info and the next morning it was arranged for me to come over and help water her flowers it had been quite a long time since i got some wound so the excitement was supreme 

i arrived the next day and she greeted me at the door with a hug i was so fucking angry it was unreal but i kept my cool she got me some water and i sat on the couch after some time her something year old son came out and introduced himself i hated him immediately and he knew it he insisted that his mom go to the store to get some more milk she left and said shed be back soon i was so lustful at this point that i even made moves on her son but he turned me down 

i struck up some conversation with him do you and your mom get along well i said he said no shes always bringing over whoremongers like you and ruining my life thats where i drew the line i may be a lot of things but im no whoremonger i stifled my fury and made some friendly banter with him until he started to warm up to me i noticed he had headphones around his neck so i suggested he listen to reign in blood by slayer i did this so he wouldnt hear shit he said he would then went to his room i then proceeded to the kitchen and i threw all the dishes to the ground i got my knife out and stabbed up all the couches and pillows and threw the fuzzy stuff everywhere i emptied the fridges contents and threw it to the ground etc

after destroying the house i waited for her return the son was probably too busy clopping or some shit to notice in the meantime i cut a  inch cut on my right cheek and destroyed my phone with a hammer i left the knife hammer and phone there and when her car pulled up in the driveway i threw the door open and staggered outside like i was crippled she got out of the car and i yelled your son is fucking crazy he started breaking shit and making a mess and then he attacked me he destroyed my phone with a hammer so i couldnt get help you need to call the fucking cops i got in my car and sped off thats when the regret hit me like a ton of bricks i destroyed my phone mangled my face destroyed a nice womans home and for what so i could get revenge on some kid i never heard from her or saw her again 

tldr i met a woman on bumble to hookup got cock blocked by her son so i got revenge my destroying a bunch of shit in her home and blaming it on him




definitely happened tonight in the heat of the moment with a full section there is no chance i got it right lady with the lipstick was safe thanks to the mark on the straw two guys sorry you indirectly kissed 
i have horrible anxiety that i have managed mostly successfully for about  yrs but i always need a safety net or an out for when things get bad at my last job i was very honest about my anxiety maybe too honest mental health has a stigma as much as we talk about it and it accept it now are a lot of people especially in the workplace and older people who see anxiety as a weakness i genuinely think its the reason i lost a promotion at my last job 

i got a new job about  yrs ago and tried a different avenue lying physical conditions are much more accepted than mental conditions i left it pretty vague but when i was hired i said hey i have an autoimmune disorder that makes day to day a little unpredictable and i get sick often because of it and may have a lot of doctor appointments when i have a flare up which is true but its a therapist and not a rheumatologist 

this has worked out amazingly so far no one blinks an eye when i have to take a last min pto day or have a dr appointment mid day or when i need to leave the office and work from home i work at a healthcare insurance company and they take hippa and every other privacy law very very seriously so i know for a fact that i will never be asked to prove it with any sort of doctors note 
and no not just a one time thing keep in mind this was usually done in the winter so before i had a vehicle with autostart id walk out to my car early in the morning this time of year i had somewhere to be in half an hour wearing either just my robe or a shirt and shorts with no underwear id open or drop the robe  clothing for a brief moment after walking behind my house after starting my car the thrill of it was just incredible

i do not suggest doing this if you live in a town
this past week ive been taking my girlfriend to work because her car is in the shop she works  hour night shifts today i took her to work and on my way back i decided to go to a gas station for some food when i left i got to a intersection and the light was red and i was stopped on the left side of the road the lane i should be in was on the right and there was  cars there as well i didnt realize i was on the wrong side until later something started to feel off and when i looked at the traffic light it was on the right side then i looked at those  cars on that side then i realized and then the wrong lane i was in the light turned green literally all the cars driving my direction were looking at me and then my light took forever to turn green and i started to think i need to somehow get over to that side 

i started trying to back up thats when the light turned green i waited for those  cars to go by then i made my turn honestly i am familiar with this area ive lived here for  years and been to that part so many times i just had a brain malfunction and didnt know what i was doing sometimes when im driving i get brain malfunctions and do things i dont normally do it is very rare but it does happen sometimes 
ok this sound very very very stupid but theres like  flies and other bugs on our window so when i was bored i smack them but not kill it unable to move but still alive when i got like alot i put them close to each other and put hand sanitizer on and around it then i set it on fire i couldnt see the fire when i put my hand on top of it it was very hot and i can see the fire like barely and it spreads fast and had to put it out with water and had to clean up had to place my hand on the window to check if its still on fire because i couldnt see it
and i did it again but with a bug spray but on wooden floor now i just dont do that anymore

yes i am stupid 
our house is like  wood
i f lied on my resume to land a job i wasnt qualified for the initial interview went smoother than expected my fabricated qualifications seemed to impress them before i knew it i was advancing to the next round the job offer came and i accepted despite the sinking feeling in my gut

as i stepped into the role reality hit me hard i was drowning in tasks i had no idea how to handle panic set in as i struggled to keep up with the demands of the job i sought help online connecting with others in similar positions who generously shared their expertise 
     
day by day i learned the ropes through trial and error slowly i started to grasp the intricacies of the job the feeling of being overshadowed began to fade as my confidence grew i persevered determined to prove myself worthy of the position

fifteen years have passed since that fateful decision i am now a master at my job a testament to resilience and hard work the lie that got me in the door has transformed into a success story of perseverance and growth 

 
a part of me is very proud of what ive been able to accomplish while the other side is disgusted with me for cutting corners ive never told anyone besides my husband and he even told me he doesnt believe i really did that 

edit im a senior fraud analyst now started off in collections and insurance disputes 

edit  i used a computer and pressed tab when typing this post originally the scroll bar reading format is now fixed 
so i know this sounds bad and it kind of is this happened when i was  i was at a week long summer camp on some forested island in the middle of bumblefk i was put in the groups for the oldest kids but i was still a year older than everyone there girls in my cabin snored the guys werent cute and one night we had to sleep on the ground with raccoons running across us i was not having it i want to go back to my villa i smell like shreks swamp 

so the rd or th morning i hatched a plan i have a shellfish allergy so the camp had my epipen along with my other medications i decided while waiting in line for the bathroom at breakfast to put my acting skills to the test labored breathing bugged out eyes the works the other campers were like shes dyinggggg and they took me to the med people i wheezed out beesting they asked me if i was allergic and i gave them a look of what do you think dude i made the leg stabbing motion of the epi pen and they grabbed it and gave me the stab of course by now i had gathered a audience of a bunch of  year old with terror in their eyes they called the ambulance dudes came in and gave me an iv heart rate yk they asked me about my voice as i have a very raspy and deep voice especially for a girl i let them know ive always had a voice like this and its unrelated i got carted off to the health hut to be monitored i would have to stay there for a few hours before i could go back to the camp stuff however if i had another reaction they would have to take me to the hospital i was like ok  in the most slightly traumatized but also annoyed teenager voice i could muster i lay there staring at the bunk above me we werent allowed to bring our phones to the camp so i was bored out of my mind   ish minutes later i decided to start the show again they came in and took me to a smaller room and gave me another dose of epinephrine the ambulance came back and said they didnt have a choice but to take me to the hospital hopped in the ambulance with like  kids gawking at me drove on the bumpiest road ive ever been on and all of a sudden we stopped why are we stopped

edit spelling also its not my problem that you didnt know what hipaa laws were when you were  i was doing anatomy and physiology classes in and out of school since middle school i knew plenty of shit about medicine at  and if you dont believe you can kiss my voluptuous ass  

theyre false love notes this english class is small with only  people when i write the notes i put somebody elses name on it and i keep putting the same persons name on it the guys name i keep putting on it he has sloppy handwriting i purposely make my writing sloppy so my real writing isnt identified and so it looks like his i fold the note up and write on the front who its going to and whos its from this has been going on for a while and the teacher is trying to hunt down the culprit heres what happened yesterday i went to english class early so i can deliver the note on a desk at the time being there was only  people in the room

the teacher was going around putting papers on desk as we were going to take a test she came by and found the note she opened it and read it then she slipped it in her pocket and went to her desk on a postit note and wrote the  of our names down both of my classmates said what why did you just write our names down for she wouldnt tell us at the end of class she brought out she found another note on a desk the funny thing is neither of the two peoples names i had on the love note were even in the classroom
i f was introduced to drugs and abusing substances at a young age through my parents and siblings growing up my father used a lot of drugs heroin coke weed nicotine and possibly more that i might not know about while my mother would drink an insane amount of alcohol and used nicotine as well until she quit once i hit the age of  i started paying more attention and my dad had his first overdose in front of me at the time my brother who was also using with my father handled the situation but i was unaware he was also high after about  years i started stealing packs of cigarettes from my parents because before my mom quite they would buy about  packs and my father would never notice one of his being missing because she bought them and hed be high after smoking cigarettes for about a year i then started smoking weeddabs with basically all of my friend groups i have a poor memory of my high school time but at some point i was introduced to cocaine and started doing that a lot which led to a lot more drug and alcohol abuse down the line i finally quit around  and had been sober for about  years now until recently i dont really know why i did it but i was offered cocaine about  months  and decided to do it since then ive done it about  times and i can tell its becoming a problem im afraid to reach out for help as i am ashamed and regret my choices but i dont know if its possible to get sober without telling anyone
ive stolen from many places usually grocery stores ill see something i want and i wont even think about stealing it ill just do it without any thought or anxiety i do it so often its like a reflex ive done it out of greed ive done it out of desperation and ive always justified it by thinking well theyre huge corporations they dont care and ive deluded myself into thinking its okay when in the back of my mind i know its not ive been doing it since i was a little kid ive stolen food ive stolen clothes ive stolen jewelry ive stolen makeup skincare perfume toys ive stolen so many things its disgusting ive even stolen bolts bolts from home depot i dont need those writing this out now i think i have a problem ive never stolen a huge amount of products at once nor anything thats extremely expensive but i dont think that really matters considering how often i steal ive let myself become evil without a second thought and im ashamed 

but i want to put an end to this and im going to now i dont want to keep justifying my greed and selfishness and i dont want to keep making myself think that im an honest person when i literally steal everytime i go to the store i want to make up for my wrongdoings but im not sure where to start besides acknowledging it and putting an end to it 
i want to start off saying im very very young but this feeling grew within me ever since i can remember i hated living i was  when i started praying for death not even that ive been just angry at the world ever since my mother brought me into this i was a brat when i was a kid but i was also neglected and sometimes abused by my mother my dad was deployed barely in the picture hell he isnt even my biological dad well just call him j j is an alcoholic narcissist and will pick a fight when hes had a bad day my parents fought all the time leading to more trauma it was never my moms fault but after a while she went away i didnt understand why until j started to pick fights with me when i was  he would mock me when i cried calling me a crybaby mocked my cries mocked my own anger after a while i started yelling back and nothing changed he got a girlfriend and now i had to deal with two of js that meant more bullshit well i guess that my explanation right now but a couple of months ago was the last day of school i was a little bitch and i was selfish i hurt my boyfriend and thats the only who i care about in the problem i lost a friend due to my actions well call her k 
k was a close friend but i always had one problem with her she made me so insecure she was in the gifted program she was so selfish when it came to certain things i mean i would try to explain to her but she still went with her side of the story when it came to anything
but what i did i still believe it was truly and moraly wrong i dont wanna talk about cause it just makes me feel more like shit but i honestly hate j j is one of the reason why i cantcouldnt work on my anger issues never got me into actual therapy when i needed it the most i mean at one point i thought being put in a hospital was the best for me to make sure i didnt try to hurt myself again but he told me i had to go to school 
i dont want to be this way i want to be happy i dont want to kill myself but then im left alone and its like nobody cares i hate being angry i just want to make sure i better for people like my boyfriend i want it to work out with him hes the best thing in my life i mean after a while j broke up with the girlfriend but now he just comes home drunk i think ill never be happy with living with j maybe my mom im trying to move in with her right now but i just want everything to wash over so i can breathe and try to fix myself i know all the saying things wont happen fast but over time i fucking get that i just needed to speak about this

updatei honestly i dont feel comfortable talking about my age if you all are wondering about it i can get a little dramatic but i honestly meant everything i said j will deny anything call him out on hes laid hands on me for just crying if not that when hes drunk hes verbally abused me and my younger sister for gods sake this dumbass had thrown a shoe my little sister for not cleaning his room is x worse and i couldnt go in there with holding my breath or gagging my mom is sober now im moving in with her if any of you are wondering about my boyfriend hes okay he and i talk about everything and im working on my anger issues to make sure i dont affect him as his own person i have gone to like school counseling and i went to only one teacher and it makes me always cry how he cared for me as a daughter then my family at the time the reason why i blame my dad for most of my anger is because after a while i started working on it on my own then i was brought into this hostile place where the only way i guess points would get across would be yelling screaming and insults i had asked j for therapy on multiple accounts and he either lied about it or would ask why would you even need therapy and even if i did try to explain myself he would just deny it all i mean when j and his girlfriend found out i was suicidal they laughed and it took until i was in a hospital bed from an od just for them to be like youre selfish but they realized i was fucked up but never did anything to help  i mean that grandpa was bashing me in the comments saying i was being overly dramatic i guess i can see that but im also in my point of view not in theirs and i believe that anyone can believe what they want but i was the one who went through that shit not them forgot to say thank you all for the uplifting comments i do read them when i have the time thanks you so much

ok so i lied about my mum s health telling the boss that she was admitted and that i need to leave n go see her and i think i will get those days off but rn i do not know what to feel about it if im feeling bad about it is it normal or should i not feel bad about it
i m have a serious gambling problem and im not sure who to go anymore it all started in the middle of covid with  here and there betting on sports and playing blackjack for fun never really was a big issue never betting more than i could handle never betting more than i could handle i have a great job i have a great job that pays me k a year i still live at home and pay the little necessities like rent and bills 

in  it got bad i lost about  without anybody knowing my entire life savings gone i called   gambler got myself banned from my respective state from all casinos and online and even told my mother about it i was doing good for about three months and then  hit and i found this app where i could bet cryptocurrency so i started there entering in  here and there i want help i know i need help and i get into these moods where i just cant stop even though i know its bad i cant help myself 

been through all the swings the gamblers have the winnings the losings im unaware of what to do and where to go i lost it all last night ive been up all night thinking about it 

i feel lost and very tired 
so this happened when i was  i think i could always swim and i went to vacation with friends family

i went beach and saw this hot life gaurd id never felt so enamored by another man before i wanted him to hold me i tried talking to him but he was distant and focused

which makes sense considered i was a fucking  year old and he was doing a life saving job 

however even then he was sweet and patient and i remember he said he liked anime and that was all i needed i think he was maybe 

he was also very warm despite his focus i could tell in a normal conversation he was probably even more so i never had a problem flirting with girls it was so easy it was boring even at  it wouldnt be anything weird but i like your hair we should go watch the new transformers stuff like that but he felt so untouchable it made me want to try harder

so i kept thinking of ways to get his attention and i decided to drown myself not as a joke though i went underwater and took a breath it felt so bad and i was panicking so much i end up flailing like i was really drowning 

which i guess i was

so its really painful salt water in my eyes and my lungs and i feel like throwing up and im forgetting how to swim or stay boyant it only lasted for maybe  seconds 

eventually i was rescued not by the guy but by some teenage girl really close by she was like  and apparently the only one that noticed something was wrong my friend said i was lucky i got saved and got cpr or whatever about her being hot but i was so disappointed 

i am and was attracted to women but that was not what i wanted i was disappointed and drowning hurt so much i asked my friend not to tell his parents he knew about the plan

idk i dont really feel guilty i feel annoyed that i know what drowning feels like but i do feel guilty that i could have been saved while someone who was really drowning needed help

also the parents are not at fault theyve watched me swim laps around them and i purposely went within the  minutes they went to get us snacks my friends older sister was watching us and i purposely went where she couldnt watch me and her brother at the same time

luckily the lady that saved me took me to her umbrella thing so his sister couldnt see

i barfed up water and could have died from infection but i got lucky i guess since i didnt tell anyone so i wouldnt get in trouble im told it helps it was salt water tho
i would put the paper in the case so whoever rented it next would naturally read the note and spoil the movie for themselves 
when i was  my neighbor was a friendly teacher we played an adventure game exploring behind apartments for discarded items one day we found a purple bra and some clothes drying from her window we played with it helicoptering and burying it a week later we tried to make her clothes fall but failed eventually we got another white bra played with it and buried it without stealing anything else now i feel guilty for taking from her five years later she got married and moved out whenever she saw my mom or sister she asked about my politeness recently i saw her again she was cheerful and kind i still feel guilty about the theft
when i was  or  i dont rember i ended up in a roast battle with a  year old girl from my neighborhood i was loosing badly in front of about  of my close friends and extremley embarrassed things slowly got more aggresive and it was at the point where everyone around me was making fun of me i at the time was not taking any medicine for my anger issues which are now treated much better i took aggresion and went to tackle her everyone was yelling at me telling me to stop but at that point i didnt care im not exactly sure what happened but i know that this incedent caused that girl to move out with a bunch of bruises cuts and about half of the hair which i was told she spent almost her whole life growing pulled out by me that day i lost  friends
i took a lollipop from a kid when i was a teen and ate it front of him he asked me to open it i did and then i ate it 

i think this happened in walmart 

i didnt like the flavor 
now hear me out this was back when i was a freshman in college up in northern california when id lived in southern california my whole life until that point
i had taken city transit to the mall where i applied for jobs at several retails outlets i didnt have a car yet well you can guess where this goes by the time my final job interview ended the mall was getting ready to close up i believe it must have been right around  and i went across the parking lot for some dinner at taco bell first mistake 
well after eating i looked at the bus route catalogue only to realize that gasp the last bus for the day had already picked up people from the mall stop
this was almost  years ago now yeeesh crazy to consider that back when cell phones were more or less in their infancy and i believe mine didnt have internet on it regardless it died on me mere moments after i was figuring out who i should call and so i was forced to use the pay phone just outside of taco bell thankfully i still had a couple quarters from a laundry run that afternoon 

a local cab company had posted a sticker with its phone number on the pay phone unit and so i called the number gave the guy on the other line my location and waited for a pick up

this was a long time ago and i dont remember everything what i do remember is how nice the guy who picked me up was and that he was playing the gorillaz on the radio i also recall thinking to myself please stop talking to me be mean or something so that i wouldnt feel like such a shmuck for what i knew i was gonna do when he dropped me off

now though i was still wet behind the ears i had some street smarts there was no way i was going to give him the address to my dorms and so instead i directed him to a frat house about a mile from the dormitories i dont remember how i gave him the address or even how i knew it i believe i just randomly said an address number for a street i was familiar with

as soon as dude stopped the car i told him i had to go inside to get the money from my mom that may sound silly now but at the time not every transaction was expected to be done through credit card or apple pay

he acknowledged me and before i had time to read his reaction to my bullshit further i opened the door to see a big ass party going on yeah like my mom was really in there 

realizing how obvious it was becoming that i was full of it i didnt waste any more time i straight booked it i ran down the sidewalk towards a back alley heading the opposite direction that the cab was faced hoping the chaos would shield me from the cab driver having sight on where i was headed as hed have to spin the car around and still keep track of me among all the partygoers goofing off and drinking in the front yard

the cab did follow me but because there were several other parties going on at the block and the alley i ran into served as the backyard driveway area for many of the houses there i was able to tuck myself behind a car and eventually watch the cab pass several minutes later good gosh i was scared as shit but i was able to slink and maneuver my way out of the area and then take the bike path back towards my dormitories

i never saw the cab driver again after all these years i dont think hell ever get his  but man those were some great gorillaz songs 
im on my alt account so i cant be traced on my main socials time and time again i often find myself faking entire personalities online completely different to my actually irl one for months at a time im a yr old f whos life is fucking boring compared to what im about to share take what i just said with a grain of salt considering the nature of this confession
the first one i ever did was  years ago and it was a  yr old girl with a history of sexual abuse i dragged on this persona on discord to over  people for a whole year solid and while this was going on i make another account on discord and faked being someones girlfriend  months after both of those wrapped up and i moved on by deleting the accounts and moving to insta where i pretended to be a  yr old with a wife and newborn that one only lasted  months overall theres alot nitty gritty detail i cant put into words and many more personas ive adopted ive done some fucked up things over the years with some of these my first one was in my opinion the worst one ive donerather not admit to what ive done on that account it was never illegal just really morally messed up ive gone from discord to insta and now reddit and im not sure why i do it and even now my current persona on my main account is of a suicidal girl who works in college is  has a girlfriend and has her own appartment i did take a break from the whole faking things after my last one which was  months ago
i dont understand why i keep returning to such a fantasy worlds were i hurt people good people over and over and mess with there feelings and fake some fucked up situations and taking months to execute a main point to these persons over the years
sorry about the awful wording but id be happy to talk more in the comments or dms i want answers as to why i cant resist the urge to happily slip into a different personality and feel relatively no guilt to any harmful things i did to over  people some people clocked on pretty fast as i sometimes just rushed the set up and personality idk what to call them persona personality being honest i feel a good when i do these things tbh i feel apart of me has been soothed until i have to eventually go back in and fake more of the same persona or make a completey new one as i mentioned before id like to know more about why i do what i do maybe theres some genuine reasons or im actually of my rocks
i work for my familys business a small coffee shop we have a rule of toilet only for customers we used to be very lenient and let everyone go but that translated into a k water bill per month so now were more strict although we let anyone who asks nicely go anyway 

anyways today i was closing the shop on my own when i saw this dude near the door but he ran off when i saw him i continued cleaning and when i looked up again the dude ran inside straight to the bathroom no hello no nothing i called out to him and told him he cant use the bathroom unless he buys something first he refused made up excuses just wouldnt take no for an answer and totally disregarded me and continued his way to the bathroom 

i saw red i felt so disrespected and anger took over my body i happened to have two glass cups in my hands and threw them at him luckily for him my aim is sht and didnt hit him but it was enough to scare him off

i wish i had sweared at him but i was so angry i couldnt think of insults 

now that im calmer i regret it i think he deserves the scare but i still shouldnt have done that and more importantly we are running out of cups and i break two on purpose 

i wont tell why family about this incident and im gonna make up some lie about the broken cups i know what i did is totally crazy and i shouldnt have done it but sadly i act on emotion far more than i should 
i need to confess something thats been on my mind

a couple of months ago i bought a meta quest  from an electronics store that offers a day return policy i was really curious about ar and had heard great things about it but to be honest i had one specific use in mind

i used it exclusively for ar porn and it was absolutely mindblowing the level of immersion was like nothing i had ever experienced before for almost  days thats all i used it for

returning it was always part of my plan it was way too expensive for me to keep so right before the  days were up i factory reset the meta quest  packed it up and returned it got my full refund no questions asked

heres the part thats been bugging me i know they dont refurbish these returns they just resell them so now i cant stop thinking about the poor person whos going to buy it next with no clue what it was used for before i didnt feel guilty at all while i was using it or planning to return it but now i do feel a bit bad for the next owner

so yeah thats my confession it feels good to get it out there but i still cant help but feel a bit guilty for whoever ends up with that meta quest  next
i am literally just stupid like really fckn dumb when im cashing someone out and then they decide to go oh wait i have  cents my brain turns off and i cant do the math i dont want to pull out my calculator either 
i often say oh sorry i cant add that change in because the system needs to count every coinbill not true 
other times they go to hand me the change and then i freeze and look confused the customer can tell and is able to tell me exactly what i need to give them back and i just go oh sorry im dyslexic
i usually just go off of what the customer tells me and pray theyre not ripping me off and as soon as they leave i double check with my calculator 
i hate to fake a disability but the absolute embarrassment and harassment i get from some of these customers is excruciating when i tell them im dyslexic they kind of relax a little bit and apologize for being rude 
i have actually gotten to the point of almost crying because im so stupid and cant count change 
i hate when they make a scene 
you are faced with my story with strange questions about me 
it all started at the start of ce year i was so happy to start a new school i met a girl well name her marie for reasons of confidentiality marie and i were very good friends over the months we both did a lot of things and above all we loved a thing was the charmed series
one day we said to ourselves why not try it for real thats when we want to create a love filter we dont judge lol once home i took a bottle of coke and started adding water blue ink rose petals bleach toothpaste cough syrup etc the next day i showed the drink to marie she told me to meet at  am at recess 
at  am some students from the class came up to us to ask if it really worked i gave the first sip to a boy i liked thinking it would work the whole class started to take my bottle to drink it at the end there was more than half left it was then that the supervisor came towards us and asked us what it was i told her that it was was a drink my dad gave me for the day yes i was stupid she took the drink and she started to smell i ended up in the office of my teacher who was the principal of the school she started calling my father and mother who were separated my mother looked at me askance and my father in work clothes looked at me accusingly when we got home my parents argued and my father ended up making me make a mouthwash with the rest of the drink which cost me  week off work and  days of blue tongue 
i dont know how to start this off other than providing some context im an  year old guy generally was considered a smart kid got awarded multiple district level awards for my grades if that even matters i had a lot of expectations on me that i couldnt live up to i feel like finally being honest now the only way i got through the last few months of school was through manipulation and lies i feel a bad for it because i caused stress however it did work out greatly in my favour 

so how this started was i relapsed hard into my depression most of my courses were online except for one i didnt have a choice but to attend that one the others id skip out on a bit mostly due to wanting nothing more but to not exist as you could imagine after a while teachers start sending emails to your parents and principal about missing assignments my mom being the good mother she is nudged me to get the assignments in assignments that i didnt have done i lied and said the assignments were done but because our internet sucks they didnt go through i stuck with this lie for  months 

i was working on the assignments the best i could i did get them all submitted before the final deadline however i for some reason decided it would be worth it to spend my little energy on keeping up my lies i stayed consistent with the story updating it as it progressed the worst but best thing i did was use my mental health crisis to keep things under my control at one point my mom got suspicious and wanted to check my progress obviously i didnt get too far so i diverted that plan by telling her about my relapse it got me the help i desperately needed as i was becoming suicidal i only regret the other motives behind that move it did buy me time to finish my work it did get me help but it was done for entirely selfish reasons 

i regret this because it showed me something horrible about myself i had manipulative tendencies before just not like that not for  whole months and not with multiple people involved never with that amount of intent either what i did was gain the ability to lie confidently control people and to not feel too bad as long as it went as planned i acted out of fear of disappointing everyone and did something that was worse i fear what i could become if i let this fester i shouldve just been honest from the start 
hi all

so for some context while  trying to stay anon im a m from canada i come from a desimuslim immigrant family my parents are separated since young and my dad lives in the states both of my parents remarried

when i was  years old i got a girl pregnant that i been screwing around with for almost a year at the time yes we used protection but it broke and by the time we noticed it was too late plan b pill was used which also failed i obviously never wanted to have a child not at least until i was established and at first she agreed to an abortion but once her family found out they convinced her to keep it and so she did and obviously there was nothing i can do

ive only told my mom and thats it i feel too embarrassed to tell anyone not even my step father who lives with me knows i just felt like a huge disappointment because my parents fought with blood and tears to come to this country and give me a better life just for me to screw myself over like this not to mention my whole family is very judgmental and gossipy type and also muslim

fastforward to the present i am involved in my childs life and have a good relationship with the mom yet i am still hiding it i say it so i dont disclose the gender i know i cant keep doing this forever but i was planning to reveal it to everyone once i finish schooland or have a career going for myself i just feel like its bad that i have a child i cant even support on my own as far as my other family knowing or my stepfather i really dont care for but my bio dad has the right to know he has a grandchild

the thing is my dad has two little toddlers of his own and theyre only  years older than my child and i have a bit of a rocky relationship with my father he left us when i was a toddler and was barely present in most of my life althought we have a decent relationship for the last  years now he is a very educationcareer first kids and marriage later not until like  type of guy he already thinks im a fuckup because i took  gap years after graduating high school hes very successful and has high expectations of me

nonetheless i know its wrong to hide my child from him but i just cant get over how to tell him do i tell him in person when i go visit do i tell him through the phone
i am very depressed and worried about my future and i take it out on other but i do it to my sister a lot i dont realize until later and i regret it so bad i feel so sick from what ive done 
i recently went out with a female friend and was very drunk she said that shed been finding me attractive and i said that we should have sex she responded with i dont think its a good idea and ill regret it tomorrow and i kept pushing the subject for way longer than i should have we then went to play darts and i put my hands on her waist we ended up walking back and i apologized for being so pushy on it and realized i was not in my right mind and that id been such a freak nothing else happened however it is no excuse but i was so drunk that i cant even remember most of the details just the gist of it

the next day she asked that we meet up to talk she very coldly ended our friendship i feel like such a rapey freak and i regret it so much she was a very important part of my life and i burned the friendship for something that i dont even want now that im sober im having a lot of trouble coming to terms with my actions and that our friendship is over i apologized and made sure she was okay but am respecting her wishes of no contact i just feel like im a terrible person and i hate myself for ruining one of the post important friendships in my life right now 

edit grammar 

edit  thanks for the advice everybody so far i think that i have made a mistake that cant be fixed in this situation i hope she decides we can move forward but i know her and her conviction is one of her most admirable traits when she ended our friendship she said that she believes that people who are capable of this are capable of it whether theyre drunk or not and i know i would never have done something like this sober but i respect her opinion on that front 

maybe in a months time i will message her to try and reconnect but id like to know opinions on that i suppose i dont want to seem pushy she knew i had a crush on her for a long time before this anyway i truly truly appreciate all the responses 

selfexplanatory title but ill elaborate when i was  i was really into minecraft i particularly enjoyed playing on the server hypixel where they have a number of ranks you can pay for to unlock additional features to enhance your gaming experience i desperately wanted a rank on the server but my parents werent interested in funding my gaming addiction for entirely fair reasons so when i realized my moms card information was saved onto the computer i did some devious investigating i was certain thered be an extra security question and that the charge wouldnt go through i was really only half joking to myself as i messed around thinking wouldnt it be funny if this worked though and next thing i know i had a rank on hypixel as a  yearold the ease of that transaction bestowed upon me a dark power i didnt know how to handle not long after i maxed out my rank on the server and showed it off to my online friends i didnt have many real ones at the time being eager to impress and unaware of the consequences of my actions i offered to share in my newfound glory asking all of my online crew if they wanted ranks too some of them even said i didnt need to do that but i insisted  later my mom saw the charge on her bank statement i denied my involvement adamantly and just burst into tears as i was entirely unprepared to face the music i was probed with questions that i either avoided or vaguely answered until my family conjured a story to explain what had happened they eventually decided not that i was a stupid child that did a bad thing but that id been hacked by one of my online friends obviously i knew this wasnt true but i went along with it because the truth was infinitely more humiliating it wasnt an entirely impossible explanation either i would message one of these friends on skype so it wouldnt have been a stretch to imagine that i couldve accidentally offered too much personal information in conversation or otherwise my mom contacted the server moderators to refund the charge but as part of their policy my account was banned from the server and presumably all of my online friends by extension im not sure i never dared to talk to them again after a lecture on internet safety and stranger danger life moved on and ive only ever disclosed my sins to one other person when i think about it now im not sure if i believe i actually got away with it or if my parents saw how distraught i was and decided to spare me the confrontation by creating an alternative explanation  years later i still havent asked and dont plan to i havent done anything similar since as i still definitely learned my lesson the guilt haunted me for years but now when theres something i want online at least im a grown adult who can pay for it himself
hi im not going to take up too much time writing this or maybe i will idk im ashamed i met them on a game all of them even the ones that left the group due to conflicts and unfortunately i was in fact part of said conflict it was the first time in my life i ever felt appreciated i felt like they were my family and it hurts even worse when i hear them refer to me as family it has almost been a year i told them i had just turned  when i met them it was a lie because i dont know i had already built connections with them they assume im turning  i feel like shit im turning  i dont know why i did what i did i just wanted some friends im truly sorry i know the two of you still sue reddit sometimes i never really used it you both said i was like a brother to you and i am sorry that i have deceived you 

i truly just wanted someone to relate to if you dont understand thats fine to i was so happy that i found people who understood exactly how my brain functioned and i could express my ideas about my characters and how their little universes worked to you both im sorry to say that i will have to just erase myself from social media i dont know if i can face you like the confident  young man i claimed to be and instead i will just disappear im so sorry
i just started driving last week so i am a very new driver like an hour ago i was getting out of my works parking lot and i accidentally hit the car right next to me i believe i did not make any serious scratches  

 i did not have anything with me to leave a note and i literally freaked out and left the parking lot i feel so bad and guilty about this should i find whos car is it and tell himher about it next week what should i do 
ive dealt with body image issues and eating disorders for years basically since i was a young teenager even though my mental health has improved since then i work in the modeling industry and i have to think about my body and what i eat constantly 

last year i moved to a different country where ozempic is very cheap and much more easily accessible than in america where i grew up i ended up buying one syringe mostly out of curiousity and it worked like magic its been about a month and ive lost kgs for reference i started out at kg cm which is fairly skinny for my height but ive wanted to be kgs for so many years tried a million diets and exercise regiments and therapy and have not been able to reach this goal 

being on ozempic is like a dream and i am so endlessly grateful that it works for me not just because i lose weight which granted is a huge plus but because i am not thinking about food constantly this has been a huge problem for me for years always thinking about food or eating or not eating feeling guilt or intense hunger or self hatred
 
i swear after one week those thoughts went from an  to a  i feel so much happier than ive ever been i eat enough to fuel my body and my energy but not so much that i am maintaining my usual weight 

i dont know how long ill continue it i know that its quite controversial in the us because theres a shortage for people with diabetes who need it but in my country its not in demand at all its easy for pretty much anyone to get if youre willing to pay for it 

i know that it might not be the best for my health but im the happiest ive been in years i havent told my family or any of my friends except  because i dont know how guilty i should feel i guess i wanted to submit this to relieve some of that feeling 
i called someone a loser and i regret it so much i let my anger get the better of me and could not look past my idealism
a few days ago i was bagging a customers groceries when a regular came up and started talking to me i was supposed to be finishing the transaction that was in front of me but instead i ended up talking to the regular after both had already walked away i realized that the customer hadnt paid i walked over to the pinpad and instead of checking to see if they just hadnt finished the transaction on their end i accidentally cancelled the payment

i dont know if they stuck their card in but if they did and didnt finish it i had no way of trying to process the payment because i had cancelled it out instead of checking first i was so shocked because i had never gotten a walk out before and id worked here for  years it was  and my card was upstairs i suspended the order and was planning on getting my card to pay for it when i went on my last break because i was so scared of what my managers were going to say

i forgot that they could also see suspended orders so shortly after i did it my manager radioed me asking where the order went i panicked and told her that the customer went back into the store to buy more items and that i was holding onto it until they came back she got angry rightfully because i should have held the items at the front instead of letting them go back into the store she cancelled our the order on her end

im not sure why i lied because if someone finds out im going to be in a whole hell of a lot more trouble than i was having just told the truth i really like this job i really dont want to lose it im so scared that when i go back in tomorrow that im going to get written up or fired i generally dont lie so i feel disgusted that that was my first instinct instead of admitting that i had fucked up the order this guilt is eating at me and i just feel disgusting for doing something like that

edit i feel like i need to add that i was not at a traditional register i was operating a part of our self checkout called flex where the customer scans their own items and i bag for them what is the point of flex our traditional self checkout is  items or less this expands it to  or less because there is a belt and a bagger for the customer flex at my store is two lanes side by side at the end where i bag there are two large screens so we can assist the customer without having to move from bagging there is only one bagger for both registers the right hand register is where the regular showed up he bought a bag of chips we started talking about how good the chips were considering they are not a name brand and they are a strange flavor the customer on the left was the one whose payment didnt finalize we regular and i talked with this customer too talked about the chips about how he was doing whether he liked the store or not it was his first time in we gave him suggestions for store brand items and we also briefly talked about the th of july and the cupcakes he was buying in total i talked to both customers for  minutes before the customer left and i realized that they hadnt paid so i was not standing there talking with a regular customer and not helping the person who left without finalizing their payment i was talking with both customers and was not paying attention to the transaction
when i was in highschool  years ago i had a car my parents rented one day when the parking lot was covered in snow i was backing out of my parking spot to go home and felt my car starting to slide and make a skidding noise

i thought i was stuck on a patch of ice or snow so i pressed the pedal harder hoping to get unstuck finally i was able to get out and i went home days later my mom saw scratch marks on the front side of my car and was pissed that someone must have hit my car their car rented for me i realized then that front right of my car must have been skidding along the side of the parked car next to me

i think i subconsciously suppressed this possibility at the time and blamed the snow in my head so i wouldnt have to feel guilty or get in trouble for scratching someones car back then i was younger and really scared of conflict so i didnt want to admit it but now that im older i definitely did minor damage to that car at least to the paint or something

ive never told anyone this but i sure hope the damage wasnt too noticeable on their car and they were able to buff it out hopefully for cheap enough i never did manage to find their car again it was white and my highschool had quite a lot of students with cars many of them white i didnt know what model it was sorry to whoevers car this was
i didnt do the hitting they hit me i was turning left they were turning right i was already turned in the intersection by the time they hit their turn they ended up hitting my car i ran out of fear adrenaline i was scared of a ticket incase i was found in the wrong whatever you wanna call it i ran and still havent been caught this happened about  months ago im still scared of getting caught idk opinions i have absolutely no damage to my car the body of their car hit my wheels that is sticking out since i have wide wheels my best friend and counselor says if it was a bigger deal that im making it out to be the cops wouldve made a be on the look out or pulled the security cameras at that light or something wouldve came out of the situation 
all over my life i lied but i dont lie about things that can make others feel bad or about other persons i just lie about dumb things that i swear i dont know why i do it for example if yesterday i was taking out the trash at  pm and for i reason i tell my friends i tell them i did it at  pm why idk

im not confessing this because someone discovered me or something bad happened i just started to think about all the things ive been lying about and i really want to stop because i think its just too dumb to be living like this and these days i started to feel unhappy because of this but i consider as a very sincere person about things that can just affect a bit someone or things that affects me this been following me all my life but one thing i can notice its that i dont lie now with big things like back then i just to lie about my parents cars my house and stuff like that and now its just these smalls things that now started to ruin me inside 
i basically have  contract roles at a time my friends and family think im running a successful business but in reality im overbilling clients like crazy most of my clients know i have outside work but they dont know the extend of the work and how much i truly overbill this has gone on for well over  years now i did it so it would be possible to send my parents money and beat generational poverty but i have constant imposter syndrome because its not an honest business model i feel like if any of my clients found out theyd be furious it feels weird to be an absolute fraud to  of people i know
i was going to a gas station to fill up and pulled up and i put my card in and thought i had paid for the gas but i guess someone had prepaid to that pump and i pumped and it stopped after  so i reinserted my card and was about to start pumping when a gas station attendant came and asked if i had pumped i did lie i kinda panicked and said no and that i had just inserted my card so the attendant said well im going to check the cameras and left and i finished pumping and drove off i know i should have been honest but i panicked im terrified im going to get in trouble and i feel horrible for lying but once i realized what i did i panicked 

i barely nudged another car in targets parking lot got out to check my car and the other persons car saw no dents or scratches i didnt leave my contact info since no damage occurred and i drove home now im stressed that i did the wrong thing by leaving im in florida what do i do now
i just want to preface that i never wanted to go to university i hated studying throughout high school but im asian and my parents sort of forced me to go to university and the story starts here

i never really knew what i wanted to do with my career and my parents suggested that i go into uni to study computer science i thought why not im a huge computer nerd and i might like computer science so i managed to get an offer for computer science from a top tier uni in my first year i realized that this field is not for me my grades were so horrible in a first year computer science course that i had to drop it i didnt want to tell my parents because i was so ashamed and i couldnt just drop out of uni or transfer to an easier uni because they would eventually find out since they were paying for my tuition so i decided to switch majors and chose applied statistics and mathematics i actually enjoyed taking the courses within these majors and my grades were actually really good so good that i made it onto the honor roll for my nd rd and th year and made it onto the deans list in my rd and th year

fast forward to june  ive graduated with my bachelors and now im applying to jobs im mostly looking for data analysis positions but lying to my parents that im looking for software engineering positions everybody including my parents knows that the job market now is bad and its not that odd to my parents that i havent secured a position the issue from this is my parents are introducing me to their friends and distant relatives who have a career in software engineering notably today they got in touch with my uncle whos a technical manager they asked me to send my resume to him so he can use his connections to help me land a job in software engineering now im afraid that my uncle will see through all my lies and expose it to my parents i dont have any relevant professional experience within software engineering nor applied statistics because i was too focused on getting good grades and makingup courses over the summer because i switched majors after first year

i know you guys think i should tell my parents the truth but its more complicated than that because of their attitude my dad is a very hardheadedstubborn guy and is always argumentative my mom has too much pride and likes to brag to her friends about me studying computer science at a top tier uni i think that if i told them the truth i would very much get kicked out of the house yes i still live with them

ive been living in this lie for more than  years now and ive always been able to manage it but since im so close to the edge of being exposed i feel like im suffocating more than ever theyve always expected me to become a software engineer making kyear but in reality i dont mind getting a computer technician job making kyear

tldr my parents paid for my tuition and thought i studied computer science when i actually studied applied statistics and math i didnt study computer science because i failed those courses in first year if i told them the truth i think i will get kicked out of the house considering todays job market im having a hard time finding a job my parents wanted to help and recently they got in touch with my uncle who is a technical manager and asked me to send my resume to him if i send my resume to him he will see through all my lies and will likely expose me to my parents

  
update  spoke with my uncle today and told him the truth i asked him to keep the conversation between us two and he more than happily agreed he was very understanding of my situation and said that it was wise for me to pursue something that im more passionate about he gave me tips on how to make myself more competitive in todays market networking skills and general life advice 

my best friend whom ive known for  years is having her th birthday in a couple days

my family is really struggling financially and i cant afford buying anything so im giving her a bracelet i never wore however she doesnt know that its a regift 
honestly im not planning to tell her
i have the box i got the bracelet in but not the bag so im just gonna put it in another bag
i actually love that bracelet so its not like im trying to get rid of it but i still feel guilty bc i lied to her
i really hope she doesnt notice but i totally am a shit friend lol
theres no gift receipt i told her that i lost it

the worth of the bracelet is actually the same amount i wouldve gave her if i had any money but in my heart i know that i didnt put in the effort to choose something for her
we were in like nd or rd grade and there was this filipino guy on the bus who literally everyone would bully they all would  make fun of him cuz his dad left him and he only lived with his mom me and my friend didnt particularly bully him but we did steal food from him when we were on the afternoon bus we were hungry and couldnt wait to eat at home  so we would sweep his lunchbox on the ground onto our seat on the bus  and we stole some peanuts and cupcakes 
for context ever since i was young ive always had sticky fingers i thought it was cools since my friends were doing it since then i have gone to therapy and am still going to therapy because of a guilty conscience
well today i caved in and stole a  item this purely is an addiction at this point in which me and my therapist have made coping mechanisms for through out the entire process of me stealing said item i knew exactly what i was doing after i clocked out and got to my car i had the most guilty feeling ever and knew what i did was wrong so i went back and paid for it i have the receipt for it and everything and i know what i still did was wrong but my question is what should i expect 
f i have a good job and could honestly afford things that i steal however it is something about stealing things and not having to pay for i get a rush from my friends the ones that do know are super judgmental about it i try to stop i just cannot i wouldnt say im a bad person and i would never steal from somebody 
opinions 
i use a delivery software to manage a fictitious businessi sell microwaveable dinners againi sometimes top meals with cheese or other garnishes to improve their appearance thus far the daily revenue is approximately  no one is suspicious and a higene inspection is scheduled very shortly but ill pass that check with no issues running a business out of your kitchen is not prohibited do i have to feel horrible being fair and free as a bird from the  existence makes me feel a little pleased edit kindly refrain from discussing if this is lawful i abide with the law in all i do since im in the uk i can operate from a home kitchen im registered and will file taxes in january and
i was being dumb and i guess my intrusive thoughts won that day i was peering over the balcony and i saw a lady sitting down i was thinking theres no way my spit could hit her from here out went the spit and it fell right on her head i felt so bad but i ducked as soon as she flinched 
every time i visit panda express i usually leave with roughly a months supply of plastic forks i suppose i just dont want to clean the dishes but im not sure why i do this

when i was  i moved to a new school these kids had all known eachother for  years the kids were awful man it manifested in sly comments and publicly embarassing you and just leaving you out it was all led by the male teacher in his mid s who enjoyed making comments about students to embarass them in front of the class and feel popular it was a small school and a really strange environment to come into after being in a wholesome primary school

there was this one girl who was nice to me and for the first  months we were each others only friends in an otherwise miserable place lets call her anna she has big buck teeth and shed had  friends her entire life

i went home and told my mother often about what was going on at school and one day she decided shed go right to the principles office and have a chat i never asked her to do this as i knew it would not be solved this way considering the ring leader was my teacher 

well it went bad

so the male teacher pulled me and the two worst girls into his tiny office and basically told them my mother had gone to the principle and accused them of bullying me and asked them to explain themselves everything inside that office after that moment i cant remember it was so stressful 
the next thing i remember is he lets us go outside all together and these two girls corner me and demand i explain myself 

at this point they knew anna and i were friends the week before shed invited me to her house for her birthday the first time shed ever had a friend at her birthday

i dont know why but i just told them that anna had a huge problem with them and hated them and that i didnt know why and that when i went to her house shed spoken to my mother shed told my mother theyd bullied us and that my mother was very defensive and crazy so she must have just gone to the principle without asking me first

for some reason this resonated with them so hard they really really hated that girl for no reason so they invited me to sit with them at recess and when i saw her i just didnt speak to her

 i never spoke another word to anna she must have been so confused and im sure she never found out what happened we all agreed to freeze her out this was my idea i suggested it so that the truth wouldnt come out they wanted to confront her but i told them its more effective if we just dont speak to her

this shared enemy caused them to accept me and i eventually adapted to the environment and became quite a mean girl myself for a couple of years while i was at that school

since all of the girls were freezing out anna she switched schools within a month and i was relieved i didnt have to face her anymore

this is one of my biggest regrets and im  and still think about it and her often i dont know why i did it its hard to explain how toxic and vitriolic that school was it wasnt normal
so im not proud of this but my drunk brain couldnt think of a better solution on the spot 

 so im at the vfw with my dad and sister drinking with my dad he gets pretty drunk and i asked him when he wanted to get going and he said that hell be good in an hour to drive and that he wants us sis and me to follow him my sister is my dd since she doesnt drink and she whispers to me that shes worried we wont be good in an hour so we ask dad to just take a ride with us since my sister lives with my parents and we are just going back to the house i tell him the car can wait and be picked up tomorrow he refuses and says he will be fine

 hes had a crap ton of shots and a good couple drinks and alarm bells are going off to not let him drive i love my dad but he is so stubborn so i know the only person who can convince him to not drive while buzzed or drunk is my mom because of this my mom is the only one who drives him home from the vfw but shes out of town for the next two weeks 

so im like oh shit i need to get other people in on this i go around asking people we know to get their opinions if he would be okay and they all agree he isnt i tell them i need their help to convince my dad to not drive a couple people talk to him and mention hey you should let your daughter drive and he laughs it off and says hes fine it was frustrating 

the only solution we were able to come up with was one person behind him and one person in front of him but my gut is telling me to not let him drive  so i go out to my car cause i was gonna leave it at the vfw over night and grab my knife and pop his tire that was the only solution i could think of 

end of the night my dad gets in his car and is about to drive and i go over and im like oh no you have a flat he is like we can drive to sheets to get air in it it took two dudes to convince him to not drive it because the tire was flat and he was in denial he hops into my sisters car bitching about the flat

 we all got home safe but i told my sister i popped his tire and she called me immature and excessive i believe it was excessive but i didnt know what else to do and i was also drunk i  just didnt wanna lose my dad to something i could have prevented so was i wrong i just want my dad to be safe and i wish he would take it more seriously 

edit ive received a lot of comments saying i should of just let the air out instead of puncturing the tire so i want to clarify a couple things  i also was drunk so i wasnt thinking clearly  even if i did think to let the air out that means i would of had to have pressed down on the valve which can be time consuming i would if most likely been caught doing so and i knew we were planning on leaving in about  mins  i tried to make the puncture wound tiny as possible to make it look like something else may have gotten to it but my inebriated brain had poor judgement so it came out to an one inch slash 

edit  a lot of people have been asking why didnt i just trick him into giving me his keys and for those who have experience with drunk people know why and thank you for saying so in the comments for those who dont know trying to take keys from a drunk person who thinks they are confident enough to drive is the equivalent of trying to take a ball away from a golden retriever near impossible unfortunately this isnt the first time this has happened seven years ago when he came to visit me when i lived in florida we got pretty drunk with my friends at the end of the night he tried to drive home drunk which surprised me because this was the first time ive ever gotten drunk with my dad and thought he was smarter than that it took me and seven of my friends to take away his keys which only happened because one of them was brave enough to tackle my dad and grab them i had to call my mom and put her on the phone with my dad and that was the only way he calmed down enough to take a taxi home he didnt talk to me for two days because even after he sobered up he was still convinced he would of been fine 

so i wasnt about to try that again the other night yes i now realize he needs help ive been away from home the last four years and came home in  since ive been home there wasnt any indication he would be dumb enough to do something like that again but now i realize my mom has been home majority of that time frame to probably keep him in check  

edit  vfw stands for veterans of foreign war and is a club for military vets and their spouses and family members my mom is the veteran

update so i forgot that the vfw has security cameras and although my intention was to replace the tires i realized i had to replace them before my dad noticed that it was slashed things didnt work out as planned since we all woke up around the same time my sister and i tried to ditch my dad before he had the chance to notice but caught us

 so we went to breakfast together then went over to the vfw to grab our cars he has a portable air compressor so his plan was to just reinflate when we got there but obviously that didnt work he started kussing up a storm when he noticed that the tire was slashed and my sister decided to take him back home 

 as fate would had it he decided he didnt want to mess around with it and decided to nap which gave me enough time to go back to the car with a jack and take the tire off run over to get a new tire and put it back on my sister helped me throughout the entire process and thank god she did because taking off the old tire was tough had to jump on the tire iron to loosen the bolts anyways she drove the car home before my dad could wake up from his nap 

he obviously was confused why i replaced the tire and just told him i wanted to help him out he thanked me and said he would pay me back but i dont plan on accepting it im waiting for my mom to return from being out of town so we can all be together when i tell my dad the truth and hopefully she will back me up i just hope my dad doesnt decide to go through the security footage before she gets back 

update  so my dad ended up going through the security footage and found out it was me he wasnt mad as i thought he would of been but im not sure how to respond this is what he ended up texting me 

im very shocked after i reviewed the video from friday at the club now i know why you were so converned with replacing my tire what the hell if you believe someone shouldnt drive there would have been many other options i had a gummy and only had a few drinks and a couple of shots over five hours normally that would just be me warming up so i guess me having a great night you assumed i was drunk i have a very high tolerance so i will put this event behind me

im not sure how to respond to this becasue  i know it was more than a few and he had two shots and two drinks within the last hour  him having a gummy and drunk probably wont do him any favors behind the wheel and  i feel like i tried other options that night but he obviously he thought he was fine 

im tempted just to tell him that i wont pop another tire again as long as he doesnt argue with me when i ask him to have my sister and i take him home instead however i know he wont take this as seriously any ideas how to respond 
so my girlfriend and i flew to a country with a terrible airline they set out on their mandatory stroll with a little trolley filled with nuts beer and tea someone made a purchase or made a fuss on the other aisle two seats back which caused the flight attendants to look over there for  seconds leaving the trolley unprotected i stole a red label whiskey and concealed it in my jacket im  years old will they get in trouble for it because there is always pandemonium on the flight i doubt they check inventories rather than refill
im a cashier i work in a store with cameras ive snagged a few electronics wireless earbuds and a charger some snacks and starting today  from the cash register i find it so easy and i havent been caught for anything i feel bad but most importantly i feel bad cause i dont really care
when i was in th grade a boy i was friends with told me he had math test but forgot his calculator and asked to borrow my ipod i said sure but when i went to go get it at the end of the day he never showed up the next week he still never showed up after the second week i asked the school office for his moms phone number and called her saying that he took my ipod but didnt give it back and the next day she dropped it off in the office when i took it home it had all of his accounts logged in the wallpaper was changed and all his contacts were in it i wanted to get revenge so i went on his facebook and changed his profile picture and cover photo to pictures of porn and made posts about how much he hated his mom and his religion they were very religious i knew this would get him into trouble 

apparently from that moment his mom decided to take him out of the school and homeschool him because he was troubled although there were other external reasons too and he was also paranoid for years about being hacked online i talked to him once years later and he brought up unprovoked about using fake names online because of someone hacking his account in th grade no one ever found out it was me and he never even suspected me i still feel bad and not sure why i even did it 
my friend  and i  in currently on a road trip early this morning i began driving to our next destination about  minutes into the drive i began to feel the incredibly lightheaded nauseous and my fingers were going numb

my friend offered to drive me while avoiding highways so he drove  hours without a license on the country roads 

i just feel like an idiot for breaking a very simple law have a fucking license what if we had been pulled over i cant stop ruminating about this please talk some sense into me
i didnt start using them right away but i had inserted lies throughout the duration of knowing this person id make up a bunch of people that didnt exist just cause i didnt really have a good reason for it i just felt like doing it at the time i guess i had made up a bunch of random things because in the moment it just worked for me

we had a pretty fucked up relationship and they had been pretty abusive to me before i started using them and then one day i just started doing it

i did it for a while on and off just to get free foodrandom things or company when i was bored they were pretty inexpensive eventually i was only doing it like a twice or three times a month at most i had began to realize how shitty what i had was and felt pretty bad about it i tried to justify it by saying they treated me like shit but i dont really stand by that honestly i did it because it was convenient to me for a little while it did feel like revenge though

i wasnt ever going to come clean about lying but i was going to tie everything off in a clean way and cut contact but then the day i decided to do it they came to me after coming to the realization that i had lied about a lot of things  
i panicked and lied even more to save face not sure why i did it honestly i was fine with cutting contact at that point but i did it anyway part of me says i did it to spare them the hurt of feeling used and part of me says i did it just cause i didnt want to be caught

in any case they believed my extra round of lying in the end and i managed to tie things off the way i originally intended albeit kind of shakily i did end up cutting contact and before i did it seemed like we were both in a great place in our lives

ive never used people in my life before this person but i did use them for a while i made a promise to never lie like that anymore and ive been holding to it with no trouble

i dont struggle with not lying but i do struggle with my guilt about doing this   
before i cut contact i did do an umbrella apology for being shitty and hurting them and acknowledging our terrible relationship and we cut contact mutually and peacefully i just keep thinking back to that moment when they found out and i scrambled to keep the lies together one last time  
  
figured confession someway somehow might help me  
  
im no longer that person im in a very healthy relationship with someone i love dearly and i could never imagine lying to or using them this way one old lie made its way into our relationship super early on but its a harmless white lie so i just left it be   
  
i just hope i can get over this i know im not this person anymore and i know i dont agree with what i did 
im now  but i just wanted to come on here and see if im not the only person who did this so young and no remorse 
so when i was around  years old my mom manipulated me into stealing my grandpas pain pills and at first i didnt want to do it but she convinced me and i honestly think thats when it started 
he trusted me to give him his medicine so my mom told me when i give it to him take some extra and give them to her 
i ended up doing this for a while and i feel really bad about it 
then one year my grandma was in charge of the fundraiser money for us to go to church camp and i would steal money that was literally helping my friends and i go on a vacation not much but a few bucks here and there for candy 
i stole cash from people who would never think it was me and never confessed 
then fast forward to middle school  highschool i would literally steal anything that i wanted but only if i knew i wouldnt get caught ive never been caught stealing which is why i think i kept it up 
i stole a friends iphone and she gave me her password so we can use find my iphone and i saved her password so i could reset it i acted like i got a new phone about two weeks later and hid it until then 
ive stolen from stores literally never paid for makeup until about  or  years ago 
ive stopped stealing completely for about a year now but since ive turned  i only stole from stores and not actual people 
theres a lot more that ive stolen but i feel like those are the worse 
it was for an art history module we had to write a short essay about any popular culture subject i copied an article word for word about saturday night tv from the face magazine my lecturer gave me a distinction she liked it so much she read it out in class  no one else knows but me until now
me m at that time had a roommate m from germany he really loved his country and i spent an amazing year with him at our boarding school 

he graduated a year before me and passed down his german flag to me and told me that im an honorary german i felt so proud and really appreciated what he did for me 

however three months ago i was jerking off and ran out of tissues and guess what that german flag was the closest thing to a tissue around me idk i was too lazy to get of my bed and find something else so i grabbed it

i feel so horrible and guilty like every time i look at that flag i just get ashamed

so a little backstory here i was preparing for my college entrance exams for the past two years and wasnt as serious about it as my classmates right now i got admission in a reputable college and it is well known so thats not so much of a problem the problem is that my mom used to pester me a lot regarding my studies which i understand but just at the start of  i got into contact with one of my old friends once more and he too was coincidentally studying for the same exams so i told my mother about this and she and his mom got in touch this guy had been preparing for these exams for quite some time while i only got serious about it recently and my mother loved to compare us both every fucking waking moment she used to taunt me so much that it lead to so many arguments those arguments were so heated my throat used to hurt the next day from all that shouting she taunted me and humiliated me by saying that shit in front of my physics teacher my maths teacher but she was smart enough not to talk about him in front of my father i used to scream tell her to leave me alone try to make her understand but it didnt work and that guy is a complete douchebag in real life i told my mother about this she wanted me to hangout with him despite me telling her so many times how arrogant and annoying he is but she didnt listen and i lashed out extremely bad that was on friday our fight was so bad and so much shouting was involved my throat hurt and her stomach started aching the next day which she later blamed me for then today on monday i wanted to talk to her about the college i had gotten and she just dismissed it another thing about her is that she is very disrespectful and will never acknowledge it she talks to me like trash calls me like some servant from across the house when she has work that needs to be done she will curse at me when she gets angry but when i reach my breaking point i am a bad son who doesnt know how to talk to his mother she never accepts her faults so today we got into the same argument after she again was acting dismissive of my college course for which i will be going out of my city in a month for five years she just seems so indifferent not even a single compliment or anything just picking at my previous mistakes and taunting me that ill do the same when i go to college it was all too much for me today so when she was in my room again today pestering me i told her to leave multiple times i was on the verge of crying and threw a pillow at her to get the point across she just brushed it off and continued it all became too much to bear and i pushed her and she fell down on the floor i regretted it so damn much and she was looking at me like im some monster so she started crying and telling me what kind of son ami i to do this and she said to me she wants nothing to do with me and that she should have never given birth to me she said she didnt want to hear my disgusting voice when i try to justify myself keep in mind that this is after i got accepted in a good college with a good course in ai she has never been appreciative of a single thing and frankly i feel like a monster i want to commit suicide i feel like dying and i feel like trash i am afraid ill do this and lash out in the same way when i get a girlfriend or a wife and be tagged as an abuser i have a past of being bullied and i really cant handle being put down like someone pathetic i feel so bad just thinking about i never once have put my hands on her and this was the first time i did it in anger i am not proud of it
i grew up in a very emotional distant household meaning any emotion that was not overtly happy was bad you would be either ignored told to push it down or sometimes be flatly yelled at threatened or hit this caused me to never know how to properly and healthy feel emotions or gauge when something was worth it i would take small things like being respectfully criticized and take them as a personal attack blowing them out of proportion 

around the age of  i realized that this was not an attitude that would help me in the long run especially considering my goals the only solution i could think of was to put myself in situations i knew that i would take personally and then force myself to work through it and learn how to let it bounce off of me i dont like being perceived as stupid to people in real life so i would exclusively act like a troll online was never rude but certainly actedspeak in ignorant ways or in places it wasnt my place to 

i still do this as i still have trouble with this but i definitely have made far strides since childhood and am a lot calmer when in uncomfortable situations i do also act like a troll on this account so feel free to talk shit to me lmao
okay so this happened back when i was in th grade 

back in th grade my family was hella poor so we really never could afford luxuries such as candy and toys i only ever got the essentials growing up i had a best friend at the time who was the best linemen on the team you all know what i mean by that every day he would come to school he had hella candy and snacks that he would eat throughout the day but he wouldnt share unless you were dating him so about  weeks goes by and he gets a girlfriend and buys her a fuck ton of candy and snacks about a week later they broke up and i had the bright idea to fake liking him so that i could get snacks because i knew he liked me so he asked to be my boyfriend i said yes and the next day at school i had hella snacks waiting for me i broke up with him after i took the snacks 

mine was actually chosen as the best one in class the truth is i have never had to exert any effort intellectually in order to succeed now that im old i regret not trying to learn more  i have spent a great deal of time lately learning as much as possible even though it will only be useful personally and not professionally
it was stock investments that was meant to be used for college but i never went to school and fell into a deep depression for years where i essentially just used it to pay rent and survive 

absolutely no reason 
and absolutely nothing to show for it 

im in a better place now and that money would be life changing down payment on a house a new car whatever but nope nothing 

edit since people are asking this was over a course of  years i have no debt and i had a job then and i have a good paying job now 
when i was  or  i charged several thousand dollars from my grandparents whom i live with to this day they dont know it was me when i was very young i was extremely addicted to roblox and one day i decided to buy robux with my grandparents credit card thats when this one kid who was probobaly older than me took advantage of my stupidity and i ended up give him probobaly several hundreds of dollars worth in robux when they found out about the charges i just lied about it and somehow got away with it i am now  almost  but i feel horrible for what i did and i would be very scared to admit this
im currently in college and on our first day the instructor went around the room and wanted us to tell us about ourselves i was the second to last person up and everyone else was employed i choked and told everyone i was employed because i didnt want to seem like a low life especially because im a bigger guy and have been looking for work but nobody wants to hire a big guy  applications and  interviews with no job kinda proves that its been  months and now im super regretful that i didnt just be honest up front and i have to continue lying about it in conversation and i feel like its too late to come clean about it especially since one person in the class is a very good friend of mine now and hes extremely honest and even tried to get me a job at his work because he said im one of the only people in the class that he actually likes talking to 

i feel horrible about it 
when i was in nd grade  a girl called my house and asked for nicki my step dad thought it was for me as nicole is my middle name even though no one had ever called me nicki in my life anyway it sounded like a high schooler and i thought this was really cool i also just liked the fact that my stepdad thought i had a friend and a cool nickname i talked as if i knew who was on the other end and she went along with it she told me her drama and i gave the advice of an  year old she called every night for about a week until my stepdad got mad that i was always on the phone in the evening and made me tell her to stop calling i think her name was sarah 
after two months of studying in santiago it was my last night before leaving after a farewell dinner with all my chilean friends one of my american guy friends convinced me to go to the club with him one last time 

i had been drinking at the dinner but little my guy friend was chasing after a girl hed been texting for a while so i found a guy to talk to he was older but i was used to this in chile since its very common for clubs to be filled with older men he looked russian which was incredibly strange in chile this didnt mean anything but it stood out to me as unusual

we talked at the bar for a while and the man bought me a drink i was distracted but i know he was holding my drink for a long time before giving it to me i took two sips of my drink and thats all that i remember until the next morning 

i woke up with white powder coated on the outside of my lips disoriented i didnt even think about it at the time i called my guy friend and he told me he found me drunk and incoherent alone and helped me home i am so grateful to him he told me he had no idea where i went but that i probably just drank too much and i shouldnt worry 

the day after was blurry to me much more than a normal hangover or maybe it wasnt and i am convincing myself it was i have bruises on my knees and shins these dont concern me too much because my guy friend said it was very likely i would have fallen in my state what scares me is bruises on  my arms there arent many but a few on my left arm that terrify me in their resemblance to finger marks 

i told some of this to my guy friend and he told me not to assume the worst he reminded me alcohol can sometimes take a long time to fully take effect then feel like it hits you all at once 

i dont know if im frustrated with my friend for assuming something worse didnt happen or if hes right in assuming that i dont want to be the kind of girl who jumps to a conclusion accusing a man of something to avoid responsibility if i got too wasted and made a fool of myself thats my own fault and im to blame but part of me feels like that doesnt add up and im terrified mainly i dont understand the powder on my lips that morning 

i dont know what to think and i am just scared 
im not sure if this belongs here but i do blame myself for what happened

when i was little around  i think there was this group of girls who i wanted to talk to i thought they were the coolest people ever and i wanted so badly for them to like me one day i went up to them and asked to be their friend being  this had worked for me up until this point so i was shocked when they said no i didnt know what to do and i was so embarrassed but the next day i decided i would try again i had a lot of determination then and i went back to them every single day for about  weeks maybe eventually they agreed to let me join their group if i passed a series of challenges they were all i had wanted to be a part of and so i gladly agreed the first challenge was that i had to eat a mud sandwich one of the girls had brought  pieces of bread specifically for me i thought it was really disgusting but they were already acting like we were friends so i couldnt say no i ate the entire sandwich it was grainy and soggy and i still remember what it tastes like to this day my second task was to go into the school bathroom with a boy in our class i really dont remember much about it except we were both naked at some point it really scares me that i have no idea what happened in that bathroom after i had done the last  challenges the girls brought out a bunch of worms they told me to lay down and close my eyes they pulled down my tights and put the worms in my underwear i had to keep them in my pants for  minutes and then i would finally be allowed to be their friends 
i wish i could say that when i got older i stopped being their friend but that didnt happen i stayed in their friendship group until i was  and the only reason i stopped talking to them is because i moved and they started to ignore my texts
i went through the burger king drive thru today and the total for my order came to around  i decided to pay  in cash i knew this wasnt enough but i just gave the cashier the money and was gonna wait for her to tell me it wasnt enough so that i could have given her my card to cover the remaining balance about  seconds later the cashier stepped away and another employee came through the window and gave me my food i was a little surprised that he did this because i knew i didnt pay the full balance i drove off anyway i know the employees fucked up and didnt communicate the fact that i didnt fully pay for my food but i really should have given her my cash and card at the same time or should have brought it up instead of driving away
okay so a little bit of background just for context is i was raised by narcissists and specifically a narc mother who was always commenting on other girls bodies and looks in super critical ways i knew deep down that everyone was equal and looks shouldnt matter but i think subconsciously i did this because i heard my parent speak on looks so much i just went with it without question unfortunately it wasnt until my s that i really set aside all care of others looks mostly because i did the work to heal the insecure parts of me that even cared im sure its no surprise that i fell into the mean girls group at one point and only years later did i except that i was one for a while being raised by toxic people can corrupt even the best intentioned people
i just remembered this memory and it kind of hit my like a bag of bricks when i was in th grade i was hanging out with friends after school and one of the girls stole my phone and put it in her bra she was like  or  but was held back and i remember wanting my phone back so i just reached into her shirt and took my phone back i dont think my intentions were anything other than to get my phone back but i realize that putting my hands in someone elses shirt was wrong 
this happened in th grade and the girl was in th  i just turned  and she was  ngl she was fine and me and my homie would walk home with her and her little brothers after school one day her and i were play fighting and she got a bit unfair she said that i couldnt throw punches or kicks but she could do it because shes a girl and she was scared she punches hard as shit tho and she was really close just throwing haymakers not wanting to punch back i kneed her in the stomach not that hard but hard enough for her to back up a bit she said something like stop boy you gon kill my baby now reasonably i thought she was joking because what th grader was catching dick anyway the next day i got around to doing it again and she said the same thing and i began to take her a bit seriously but i didnt want to because yk  graderpregnant no way bro then a couple days she tells me that she had a miscarriage i was in shock i asked  if her friends and they all confirmed that she was pregnant beforehand i was utterly mortified i still dont know if i wanna trust that however but i just may have blood on my hands


updatewhen i say got to doing it again i didnt mean i just went up to her and kicked her i mean we got to play fighting again she gave the same silly rules and i kneed her again  for all of those who think little middle school me is a psychopath and a woman beater
when i was  years old we were coming back from lunch and the teacher had told us before lunch we werent having recess that day

so that made me mad because i wanted to go outside  so i saw the opportunity to go outside a little red box that said fire  pull down  i pulled it  my classmates looked at me in disbelief  then the i heard the loud shrill of the fire alarm and we went outside

my kindergarten teacher comes up and stoically tells me im going to principal

anyways i go to the principal and hes grilling me  im getting scared im going to be expelled  so i play stupid  i say well the box said to pull down  i was just obeying what the sign says  like whenever my mom sees a stop sign she stops her car  i was just trying to be a good citizen and obey the signs  principal goes silent for a second and then lectures me on how dangerous it is to falsely activate the alarm  then he tells me hes calling my parents  but that was it

my mom only said one thing to me about it why would you do something like that  youre better than that  the way she said it made me feel bad

after that some kids thought it was really cool and would highfive me in the hall

looking back on it i also realize now there was another reason i wanted to show my classmates how cool and brave i was

i dont know why i still feel bad about this im  this happened  years ago
i used to be a preschool teacher one day in breaking up two toddlers fighting i scratched one of them just below the eye nothing serious he started crying my co teacher came over to see what was going on and asked the crying kid he said he was fighting with the girl i said she mustve scratched him she got in trouble it was me and my pretty nails i scratched hugo the child sorry hugo
my biggest regret yet was harboring resentment towards my mom over past toxic family experiences and stealing over a thousand in government funds from her account to spend it on partying and buying clothes months before she passed away from aids  years ago because of that my brother is still on bad terms with me til this day and this whole situation has been fucking me up harder than it did when she first passed away and just hoping one day ill make up for it but doesnt seem possible
when i was a teenager i used to be front end manager at a grocery store until my early s the job sucked so i did what i could to amuse myself we cycled through employees pretty quickly so sometimes i would make up crazy stories to tell to new hires that i didnt think would last too long one night i had a younger kid on shift he was like  at the time and clearly not the brightest for some reason i had a velcro strap on my wrist that i needed for something and just put it on as a bracelet so i didnt lose it before i needed it the kid asked me why i had the velcro on my wrist so i convinced him that i had some rare disease where i didnt show up in photographs because my body didnt generate enough static electricity and i had to wear the velcro to generate enough static to do so in all honesty i never thought it was believable but he was fascinated he asked so if i take a picture of you right now you wont show up i said no im good now i have my velcro on but i came up with a whole back story about how it was months before anyone noticed because in the age of disposable cameras my parents picked up on it after getting a bunch of rolls of film developed from when i was an infant to realize i didnt appear in any of the photos and my family members appeared as if they were holding nothing 
my job tip pools which i think is stupid its not really a huge deal because im not working to pay bills or anything but its just annoying to have to split money that ive earned so ive started keeping most of my tips for myself 
ive never told anyone this and my classmate still doesnt know 

when i was a kid i saw one of my friends eating a massive white chocolate macadamia nut cookie for lunchtime i wasnt given a packed lunch i had free school meals and a free fruit so i would get pretty hungry during the day

anyway when everyone had taken their st break i stayed behind in the bathroom i went to her packed lunch box and stole her cookie 

it was beautiful it was slowbaked and fresh and had the sweetest taste and tore apart like a crumble in my mouth to this day it is the best cookie i ever had 

anyway after i had finished i threw the rubbish away and returned her lunchbox coming up to lunchtime i kept a keen eye on her anxious to know if i would be caught and frightened that the jig was up to my glee she hadnt noticed that she was missing her cookie she had probably thought that her mum didnt pack it for her 

the next day the same thing happened i waited for everyone to leave on the first break hid in the bathroom devoured the cookie discarded the rubbish and returned the lunchbox 

this time during lunch i could see that she was confused as to why the cookie wasnt in her lunch box the rising adrenaline took over my heart began to race and my hands became clammy i watched from a distance convinced she would come over and confront me she didnt 

after lunch the case of the missing cookie spread it was the talk of the class someone was stealing her cookie and others were deliberating if they had been struck by the cookie culprit or if would they be next accusations were flying  someone saw another classmate with a similar cookie for lunch and another person had seen someone in the corridor earlier i was off the hook again but now it was serious 

the next day came around and all i could think of was the cookie i overheard her talking to her friends she confirmed that her mum had packed it and she would be eating it at lunch st break came around and i was ready

i snuck into the lunchbox area like before and scoffed the whole thing down anxious that i would be caught i scurried out to the playground and went about my day undetected 

after lunch the teacher announced that her mum had called in someone had been stealing from her daughters lunchbox and she wanted to know who we were all warned that it was being taken seriously and of the ramifications of our actions 

i knew i couldnt steal the cookie again but i also needed a fall guy the previous year a boy in my class had punched me and i never got my revenge it was coming together like a jigsaw puzzle he would be perfect and it would be believable 

i confessed to the teacher that i had seen him looking suspicious in the corridors and the bait was taken he had taken the blame and i got off scotfree

i do feel guilty about this to this day especially for blaming it on someone else when i look back i cant believe that i would ever do that but i did to my classmates im sorry i stole your cookie and im sorry for blaming you for my actions 
it was just laying on the counter and no one was paying attention and i was starving so i just stole it i was never caught
i made the worst decision of my life a few months ago i was desperate addicted broke people trusted me and continue to trust me and i betrayed that trust six months ago at work i was in charge of  cash and spent it instead of turning it in no one has noticed or questioned me about it at all its eating at me i cant sleep im pounding with anxiety i deserve any bad things that happen to me im going to take the cash out of my next paycheck and find a way to return what i took maybe anonymously im a terrible person and there has to be a way to make this right for my family i cant live with this sword hanging over my head honestly i feel like dying any notion of me being a decent human being is gone 
i currently have no money im super irresponsible with my money and have a limited amount a month i spend my money on myself marijuana and cigarettes unfortunately smoke a few friends out a few times and then start hanging out with specific people i know will feed my addiction 

storytime im  but i was in a car crash when i was  i had a piece of my brain removed due to swelling i spent a month and a half in a coma in addition to a host of medical problems while i am able to work i am lucid cognitive and ablebodied although kinda overweight now due to laziness my old friends although they stood by for a while but now theyre either parents spouses addicts dead or lost in politics the two friends i currently spend my time with are both disabled in the same manner as me tbi but they are both objectively less cognitive than me i dont particularly like spending time with them but i do because i get things whether it be smokes or just something to do

when i had a job somewhat recently i hung out with them a lot less i still saw them to keep up appearances i guess i mean theyre cool id see them sometimes but thats because id feel bad probably because i want everyone to like me but ive always been this way to an extent especially after the disability i dont know

i never did anything too evil or immoral but i have an ability to usually make people like me i dont lie but i exaggerate i feel bad using that ability very immoral thats kinda manipulation right so i guess im sometimes a manipulator but i dont change

there are so many changes that have to happen i still have so much potential instead of using this potential i am just waiting for something to fall into my lap and subconsciously making my friends sometimes give me stuff small things though like convincing my friend to buy weed and smoke me up when he didnt want to and him ending up thanking me meanwhile i feel horrible i did that the internal voice is like maniacalsad i feel very immoral for this i have so much changes to make including this i dont understand why im not changing maybe its just easier to make this topic and absolve myself instead of actually changing there we go i psychoanalyzed this post so you dont have to 

i want to delete this now but i already wrote it so

edit now i didnt think this is true because those two friends are admittedly very lonely i give them something to do also i invite one of the dudes to parties when i go i still think i have these negative traits but i try to give back when i take
 

when i was a teenager i worked for a local chain of gift stores that specialized in greeting cards we had  stores in the region and not once did any of us ever work in any other location than our store

i worked there for   years i was never late never called in sick picked up extra shifts whenever they asked me to worked late for special events and vounteered holidays i was even put in charge of my own department ordering and floor setting mikasa cyrstal  but i was always paired with a miserable supervisor she was an older woman who used to make us massage her back tie her shoes kept drinks at the cash wrap even though it was allowed and loved to leave us with one cashier usually me at our busiest time  she also had this lovely habit of coming into the break room to see what we were eating for lunch and say you can eat that in  minutes you need to be on the floor were busy  we were an extremely busy store it was the s  everyone complained about her but nothing ever got done i absolutely adored the job but working with beth was pure torture

at the  year mark when raises were being handed out and i was given a  per hour raise  the reason well beth said you arent a team player   i was furious money was tight at home so i worked to buy my own school lunhes clothes and car insurance gas school supplies etc my senior prom was coming up and i needed a dress

this store sold a lot of collectibles  think of the overpriced bric a brac they used to sell in the s that all of our moms hoarded thinking they we would be valuable someday figurines little light up houses plates etc

one day a customer bought a new figurine that had recenty come out it was from a collection of figurines featuring doe eyed children to give you an idea it was huge and very expensive for the line around   she paid with cash i went to the back to get one of the boxed ones  noticed there were a half dozen more of the same figurine after  i rang her out i reprinted her receipt  this was before transaction capturing our reprint didnt say they were reprints i then went to the back took one of the figurines and stashed it in the trash beth would never take the trash to the dumpster i always had to do it  so i did and stashed the box behind the compactor and retrieved it after my shift  two days later i went to another one of our stores in the next town over and returned it for cash

i did this every few weeks for the last  months i was there only ever cash transactions and only when were busy so  no one would notice me reprinting receipts and  i was always going into the stock room  i only did it with boxed collectibles that we kept in the back

never got caught we had enough stores in the area that i could go to a different one each time so no one was wondering why one store was getting so many returns from our store i quit that fall to leave for college

looking back i know it was stupid not just immoral but they definitely would have pressed charges had i been caught and i really did like the job  while classmates my age were standing over deep fryers i was dusting crystal and straightening cards and came home smelling like scented candles rather than lard so i felt rotten about it later  but my parents were really struggling and i was a teenager on my own to pay for even basic essentials and getting ready to leave for college   the chain folded a few years later due to interperosnal problems between the owners i dont think they even noticed the missing merchandise
i got bullied really bad in th grade because i was very vocal about my love for anime and everyone thought it was weird this was in  so when i found out i was moving schools i told my best friend to help me out with telling people i had cancer to make people feel bad for bullying me she was practically my only friend so no one would know if i was lying or not because no one really knew me like that we started telling people and when i moved schools i had her tell them that i died from the cancer

she told me this one girl started crying when she told her i died i dont know if she ever told the truth to them she hates me now so ill never know 

yes im prepared for the future cancer that karma will bring on me for this just wanted to put it here i feel pretty messed up when i think about it

probably shouldve made a throw away account for this now people are gonna think im really messed up in the head 
it was a free lecture the teacher was absent the substitute teacher had some work and assigned me as the disciplinary monitor of the class for the lecture and left the class akid sitting next to me was playing with some trading cards and this kid was literally the class clown the troublemaker always got punished by teachers and i thought he isnt a good kid so i went close to him snached the card and tore it i dont know why i remembered this but now i am getting all sad and emotional and remembering how i unknowingly made another kid cry and all the bad deeds i ever did i am just hating the kid me who should have known better its not that big of a deal but when i reached my teenage alot changed with me whenever i saw some emotional stuff even if it was as small as a kid crying after a falli would immediately imagine myself at their place and feel sad about itit had stopped a few years ago but today that sadness came backthe feeling of a sad child who did nothing wrong i fricking hate myself
made another account for obvious reasons

last year me and this guy lets say mark were kinda close and we were graduating from college we both were computer science majors and were ready to graduate and start our lives as you may know the job market is in shambles right now and even getting a internship is pain

i applied for a job listing and it had a offer where you would get some bonus if you referred a friend i of course referred mark and he somehow got a interview and job offer while i didnt even get a letter back

no offense but i was better then mark in most aspects better gpa more experience 

the reason i think he got the job was because he had a internship at google and his dad was kind of a big name in some company

that part really didnt bother me as much but its when he boasted about it i dont blame him for it as its exciting to get a new job however i felt like he was bragging a little to much this also didnt help that he talked about moving in with his gf and starting a new life while my ex broke up with me for some reason id rather not say

i had enough of this and did something i really regret i was over at his apartment and was in his room and noticed he was logged into his school account i think he was sending his transcripts to the job or something i think he left the room to answer a call and i realized i had a opportunity

i truly regret it at the time but i didnt care and jealousy was running threw me i logged in and dropped his classes

this was midway threw the semester so they appeared as withdraws

i was only able to do this for  of his classes and the other  needed registrar approval

i quickly tabbed back to what his screen was before and pretended nothing happened

i got a call later from him a month later that the job offer was taken away as he could not graduate that semester even when pleading with the office of registration

you might wonder how did he not know it was you me and him were really good so he never accused me of it and he though someone hacked him

he later did get a job offer but it was way less then what he had i actually earn more then him as he is still working there

i feel terrible but whats done is done and i just wanted to vent about it

im really sorry mark
these two people were always very nice to me we had a lot of moments when we got along but a lot of the time was me making them feel guilty about all my problems i had and i just blamed them for everything that was falling apart in my life i harassed them almost every day for probably  months i texted them horrible things and played the victim constantly   they say they forgive me but i just cant live with myself anymore because nothing is fun anymore knowing what i did i cant be happy and i dont deserve it ive made several life ruining mistakes at   and  im  now and havent screwed up yet  and alls i want to do is help other people now and that is something i swore to do for the rest of however longer im going to live 

alls i feel is remorse for the everything ive done in my life and its miserable should i be forgiven and do i deserve a life

so as the title explains i had a relapse after  days of not harming myself it was a culmination of stress from exam periods and a specific assignment due tomorrow that im probably not going to be able to finish i know that i should probably talk to someone other than strangers on this app about my issues and the fact that i just relapsed but i cant think of a single person that i want to tell telling my therapist wouldnt be smart as i would like to prevent my parents finding out about this and due to the policies she has she would be forced to because i am a minor i dont want to unload this on any of my friends as they are either not as close to me or on the other side of the world part of the reason i might have relapsed is because my previous scars had almost completely faded and there was an enormous sense of guilt that came with that which makes me worry that this cycle will only continue after these fresh ones start fading im headed out with friends in about an hour or so and am supposed to be doing work on the project i mentioned earlier but right now all i can focus on is how distanced i feel from myself sorry for unloading this here but i feel like this is more okay as thrill be easy to ignore to anyone who did read this have a great day 

tldr i relapsed after  days and dont know how to cope
i thought it was a really good  idea to use the backs of the chairs to walk down to the front having made it down the  rows i nearly made it apart from the last row unfortunately a girl was sitting in the next seat to my triumph and i landed really heavily on her leg embarrassed and apologetic she screamed in pain i begged forgiveness bought her and friends a round of drinks but the damage was done she was fine about it but i will cringe for the rest of my life
my mother comes from an oldmoney family and inherited precious family jewelry although she almost never wears it one day in primary school i decided to give a birthday gift to my sweetheart at the time lucile i went to my mothers bedroom picked out a pair of beautiful gold and diamond earrings and put them in a small camera film box the next day at school i gave them to lucile

since my mother almost never wears jewelry it took her several months to notice but when she did she was very upset not only did the earrings have sentimental value but apparently i had stolen the most expensive pair of all she searched everywhere for months and asked my brother and me many times if we had seen them

eventually my grandfather was informed and he was furious too because those earrings had been passed down for many generations 

its been over  years now and i have never said anything sometimes the topic still comes up at family gatherings
m 
so when i was in rd or th grade i dont remember i really didnt want to go to one of my baseball games the next day it was out of town and i wanted to hangout with my friends that day i decided that i was going to fake sprain my ankle because thats the most plausible way dont know how i thought id be able to see my friends with an injury but whatever anyways my mom was in the living room and i fake tripped over the table made the waterworks come and everything looking back i dont think i was too believable but my mom decided to take me to the er anyways
i was crying the whole way there and when we got there they rushed me in they took xrays and gave me an iv all the fun stuff 
here comes the wildest part it was actually broken my growth plate was fractured and they immediately put me in a cast ive always had a high pain tolerance but that was actually freaky it didnt hurt at all
they showed us the xray and everything said i might need surgery and they needed to monitor the fracture 
they had to xray me frequently after that to make sure my foot would still grown normally as well or something like that
i did successfully get out of that game though i was not to happy about being in a cast and a boot for a few weeks however
anyways ive literally never told anyone this so yeah thanks for reading 

so basically i was on a website that wont be named and i was asking for a plug for some context this app is for hook ups but a lot of people do sell on there anyways some guy added me and was like ill give you the stuff for free if you give me  and i was desperate so i went along with it i was going to do it in his car but he ended up not showing up for the first meet up so he texts me sorry but was like ill give you  if you swallow a bit of my pee for the recorded i was extremely discussed but i was kind of poor and really desperate so i went along with it again bad idea guys not to go into details but we meet up and it was terrible the guy was extremely shady and i swear almost kidnapped me i did end up getting the stuff but guys not a good experience moral of the story dont meet up with strangers on the internet and guys its never worth the money or  edit guys im a boy please stop asking me for titty or pum pum pictured edit  guys im talking about weed no other drugs
basically just what the title says i joined social media in the th grade and quickly made tons of friends online but they were all  when i was just an  year old kid so i lied about being three years older than i actually am im close to turning  soon and the guilt has been eating me alive but im just so heartbroken by the idea ill lose friendships ive built over these past years im sure most people probably wouldnt care enough to end the friendship with me because quite a few of them are around my age anyways  but im sure it would cause my reputation to be tarnished and the few adults who are already much older than me to be disgusted about being friends with such a youngin for example i have a friend whos so supportive and has been so nice to me whos  and i feel they might be disgusted with knowing im actually  years younger than they are i also just know so many people who have built a supportive community around me and even though my current real relationships arent bad at all ive essentially grown up with these people and gotten attached to them lately i just feel so guilty and so trapped so many great things have been happening lately and i wanna talk about them but i obviously cant

i recently yesterday came clean to two of my friends that ive known for the past  years and they took it really well but theyre also around my age and have never been serious people so i assume their reactions would be drastically different than some of my other friends will be if i decide to come clean about it they dont really have an opinion on the whole thing because theyre okay with still being friends and have actually joked with me and laughed with me about the whole thing and arent pressuring me to tell the truth but one of them is just concerned ill become very overwhelmed and itll just spill out anyways in the future if i dont just come clean now like i did with them im also scared because i had a relationship with someone at the age of  when she was  im ashamed to admit i didnt see anything wrong with this at the time and we also frequently talked explicitly and were great friends now and have been only friends for the past five years now but i know shed probably feel disgusted if she found out i dont wanna lose her because of the history between us but i also understand im way in over my head for the reality of my age im just so frustrated and disgusted with myself too for letting it go on this long im definitely not saying im mature because if i was this would have never happened but i am extremely academically intelligent and i assume most of these people dont suspect me because of how i carry myself should i just keep going until i can decide i can move on eg delete all my accounts suddenly or make the move to tell the truth
not actually a theft ring but i dont really know how to describe it accepted bribes to commit theft for others

i worked in food  beverage as a cashier in a very small restaurantcafe type thing our little cafe branched off the main building where it was pretty much just me a cook and a couple other cashiers rotating working days managers rarely came out to our location unless we called them or they were bored we only really served a very specific crowd with pretty much the same people everyday  

one day a regular customer came up to me and ordered and stated he didnt have money on him and asked if we could start a tab on paper for ious i said sure eventually he just kept adding things to the tab and said he would pay it off when the number was a little bigger 

one day when nobody was in the restaurant he said to me that he would pay me directly a percentage of his tab and that i would just make it disappear  so when his tab was over  he would give me like ish and i would just rip up his tab like nothing happened i never once put any of his food into the system just wrote it down on a loose piece of paper and kept it in the drawer other cashiers could add things to his tab but could not cash it out 
 
when other cashiers would ask where his tab went i would tell them he paid it off and i would print out a long fake receipt showing that he paid  and they believed me i told them only i could cash out his tab since i was stand captain 

 more regulars caught on and did this as well i only did it for the regulars i trusted 
eventually after the years went by i got a little comfortable and i would lie to the regulars and say their tab was higher than it was just to get a little more money i would say  instead of  nothing too extreme

i mean as a  year old getting  pocket cash here and there was the best thing i actually saved enough from the theft working wage and tips to buy my first car 
now i worked for a millionbillion dollar company im glad i did not work for a family owned business at the time 

looking back at it i didnt even comprehend that was theft now im like omg jail time i knew i shouldnt have been doing what i was doing but i wanted the cash got away with it and didnt think it was a crime 

i mean i dont exactly regret it my excuse is now that these were grown men knowing exactly what they were doing asking a  year old to commit theft maybe they thought if i got caught i was a minor so the penalty wouldnt be bad or thats how rich people stay rich by being cheap and comiting crimes 

i could never do that now a piece of lint once fell out of my pocket in the grocery store and i picked it up immediately because i thought karma would get me for littering  welcome to adulthood anxiety teenager me had balls 

thoughts i still dont think i would ever tell my company what i did 
i feel so guilty  it was an accident but i still feel guilt 

in grade  or  it was winter and recess i told a girl to go down the tallest slide on her knees it was fun for me and she did but right at the bottom she twisted or lost her balance or something and smashed her face off the end of the slide when she got up she had her hand over her eye and it was bleeding above the eyebrow didnt seem too bad but i was a kid so idk 

she went home at break and when she came to school the next day she ended up having to get stitches and glasses im almost certain she wore glasses for the whole year i changed schools the year after but i feel like she needs them permanently 

what guilts me more aside the fact that she needed stitches and glasses all because i told her to go down the slide in a dangerous way all i actually cared about was that i was going to get in trouble for getting her hurt 

im sorry pernema pernima i cant even spell her name but thats how it sounds 
when i was in my sophomore year of high school my dad was the treasurer of the booster club for our theatre department and ms l fake name was the president ms l would always go above and beyond volunteering to help out with stuff for productions and for our musical she made these elaborate and beautiful horse heads for people to wear my dad was meant to pay her for her labor but he and ms l never crossed paths so he gave me the check to give to my friend ms ls child it was at the end of the year and i forgot to give it to them on the last two days of school and when i realized i felt really guilty and hid it in my room and blocked it from memory it was only when i was with my dad and happened to run into ms l out somewhere that she mentioned never receiving the check my dad was under the assumption i passed it on and i lied saying i did so ms l thought it was her kid that messed up and lost it or something and got mad at them now its been a few years and i still have the check hidden in my room but feel too bad and guilty about it to come clean im pretty sure theyve all forgotten it by now and ms ls kid has never said anything to me about it so im probably in the clear but i still realized i did something wrong and i feel to guilty to throw the check away even though its long expired by now 

tldr i forgot to give my friends mom a check a few years ago and now its expired hidden in my room and i feel bad
when i was younger i lived on an island where we had to take a boat to get to the mainland  i used to always sit at the top and spit on peoples heads who were looking out the windows or hanging their head out  idk why
its fucking horrible i know im turning myself inside out trying to think of the right way to handle this situation ive never thought of myself as particularly selfish and im a terrible liar everything about this is antithetical to who i am as a person so why am i considering doing such a despicable thing

my new roommate megan f and i f met two months ago after finding each other on one of those roommate apps the age gap is a little big ill admit but it hasnt really presented an issue yet because i work with local housing programs at my job im more knowledgeable than most twentysomethings about housing policy and landlords megan although  lived with family for the first half of her twenties and has lived in student housing or been couch surfing for the latter half as a result she has never lived on her own before and is at a loss when it comes to renting in addition personalitywise im a pessimistic and jaded yearold in the body of a year old and megan is a little naive by nature so it kind of fits

megan and i have never lived together before and are little more than strangers but weve also spent the last two months getting to know each other as well as we possibly can although megan is staying with a friend and has no deadline for moving my current lease is up at the end of june two months seemed like plenty of time to establish a solid roommate relationship lucky for us we get along extremely well both our habits and lifestyles seem to compliment each other since we met weve been apartment hunting we were ready to sign a few different leases but all of them fell through at one point or another for reasons outside our control but last week we finally signed the lease on a great apartment thank god our official movein date is june  everything seems to be going great on that front

enter the bed bugs i found a bed bug in the bedroom of my current apartment a little over three weeks ago i had a white trash bag sitting on the floor and i saw a little black bug the size of a small appleseed crawling on the plastic i instantly recognized it and submitted a maintenance request to my property manager that same day with a picture attached that was sunday at the beginning of may i put in the request and then forgot about it for a few days i figured an exterminator would come by soon and the problem would be resolved quickly i even wondered if maybe id been lucky and it was just the one

ten days later on a wednesday i decided to check for bugs i hadnt seen a thing since then and i hoped that maybe id been wrong about it being a bed bug i lifted up my mattress and found nothing and then i looked over my box spring still nothing i sighed in relief and turned the box spring over so i could examine the underside thats when i found at least  live bed bugs from sosmallicanbarelysee to ridiculouslybulbousandlarge skittering along the bottom edges there were also at least a dozen pale white eggs so small id have missed them if it werent for the rest i think i stopped breathing earlier that week id lost some faith in the exterminator and bought a can of raid foam spray i immediately grabbed that can and began spraying everything i could i took lots of pictures and collected the biggest bugs in a jar filled with rubbing alcohol id started to wonder if id need evidence if maybe the exterminator and my pm just werent worried enough well they would be now

as i sprayed and sprayed and as the hours ticked by i became angrier and angrier i wondered why no one had come yet even then angry as i was i could understand why there was no urgency its possible the exterminator and my pm didnt believe my roommate and me picture or no you see a few months back my current roommate ash nb knocked on my door late one night and told me theyd found a bed bug crawling on one of their stuffed animals perfectly calm i asked to see it but they said they didnt have it as soon as they saw the bug they squished it immediately and flushed it down the toilet while this might have made sense to them at the moment i was furious although id never had bed bugs before i knew that there were lots of bed bug lookalikes it could have been practically anything without evidence the only thing we could do was act as if it was a bed bug and that meant we would need to panic and panic we did ash and i stripped our beds bare and spent the next few hours running all of our bedclothes through the dryer then we checked every inch of our rooms for more evidence of bugs nothing nothing but nothing they sent in an exterminator who sprayed down ashs mattress and who then told us to spray the furniture down with rubbing alcohol and remain vigilant and then once no more bugs were found we both moved on

cut to now i dont know if the bed bugs i found came in with me or ash recently or if theyre just the result of what ash found all those months ago i dont know if they came from up or downstairs or if theyve been here since before we moved in a year ago waiting and dormant i live in a duplex so theres every possibility they came through vents or contact with my neighbors for some reason i feel like theyre new and i think ash was mistaken that first time but at the end of the day theres no way of really knowing

that wednesday night i was awake until am combing through the mattress and box spring spraying and grabbing bugs with tweezers i grabbed what fabric i could and ran up and down the stairs throwing everything into the dryer and cooking my belongings on the highest heat possible it seemed like it would never end i think i had entered some kind of frenzied mania and couldnt rest the old floors creaked something awful and i knew my downstairs neighbors would be enraged by all the noise but i couldnt find it in me to care ash was gone that night and i was alone i texted ash updates as i cleaned and i called both my pm and the exterminator directly leaving voicemails for both of them

the exterminator must have heard the panic in my voice loud and clear that morning because he showed up the very next day at am and sprayed my bed with insecticide while i was at work ash let him in in the end even with all the evidence i provided even with the jar full of dead bugs sitting on my nightstand he still didnt believe me he called me afterward and said he couldnt find a single bug in my box spring i couldnt believe it and part of me wondered if hed half assed the spray job because of it

that wednesday marked the beginning of my troubled sleep its when i started getting itchy red welts along my arms and shoulders and when i spent most nights sitting up scrolling through article after article about the best methods for eradicating bed bugs theyre nocturnal you know and they hide during the day the best time to look for them is in the early hours of the morning around  or am every other day id flip my bed and check the seams with tweezers and a flashlight ive found  bugs on the mattress since then but thats about it

this would be the kind of thing to break me its been a very very hard year it started last summer when my car was totaled in an accident  not my fault but the other guy had expired insurance and well you know i was still in college at the time and had to pull out seven grand in additional student loans to afford a new car this led to a chain reaction of debt and ive been sinking deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit i also moved out for the first time a year ago yep thats right  this is my first apartment yippee ive been working a job that i hate but cant leave for the past year as well im thrilled to say that i was offered the job of my dreams and will be starting next month but i will also be moving to the new apartment that same weekend my best friend was supposed to help me move but she backed out because of the bugs and now it looks like ill be moving all on my own and no i cant afford movers

its strange how so many life events seem to occur around the same time im under so much stress its like the universe is trying to kill me discovering bed bugs right when things seem to finally be looking up is the worst kind of irony

i spent a weekend wallowing in self pity i gave myself that time to feel sorry for myself and complain to my close friends and family  the only ones i could trust with this kind of a secret and then i picked myself back up and started drawing up a plan i am well on my way to becoming a certified bed bug expert i have a list of methods for resolving a bed bug infestation and if i can put these methods into a defined process then maybe i can beat this thing maybe just maybe i can get this situation resolved to the point where i can move to the new apartment and the bugs wont be traveling with me i dont want to bog this post down with specific cleaning details but as a general overview ive been undergoing a combination of routine vacuuming scrubbing steam cleaning athome heat treating air tight sealing de dusting and discarding ive been changing out of sealed bags when i leave the house to avoid carrying bugs on me im hoping to get  rounds of insecticide sprays from my landlords pest company before i move out completely the next spray on schedule is june  ive discarded almost all of my furniture and most of my belongings will be sealed away in storage for at least two years to ensure any remaining bugs are dead ive vacummed steamed dusted and permanently encased my mattress and box spring essentially im throwing everything i possibly can at the wall until something sticks

so that brings us back to this terrible decision i have to make  do i tell megan about the bed bugs this might be the worst thing i could ever do its immoral and unethical on every level and so unbelievably selfish im putting megan at the risk of an infestation without her consent and its not just any kind of pest infestation but one of the worst ive heard that most would prefer cockroaches over bed bugs because at least cockroaches can be killed using poison bed bugs unfortunately have evolved to survive most pesticides as such they are almost impossible to eradicate thats why theres no such thing as a silver bullet method  you have to take extreme action for every method you can think of

im going round and round in my head trying to weigh my options here

option   tell megan right now about the bed bugs fun fact about megan shes deathly terrified of bugs and insects in general and the mere possibility of bed bugs would send her into a coma shed drop me as a roommate plain and simple even if im on the lease shed find a way to ensure i never enter that apartment

option   find a new roommate with a month before my lease is up id be thrown into the desperate situation of finding a new roommate and an apartment on extremely short notice while i could maybe pull that off itd probably go rotten eventually because wed either not be compatible or more likely id have to tell them about the bed bugs regardless who in their right mind would rent with me knowing that i wouldnt

option   what about ash my current roommate ash is moving in with their partner of four months and does not want me around more to the point ash has some pretty intense conflict avoidance whenever things get hard they tend to bolt the day after we found out we had bed bugs they packed what they could and have been living at their partners for over two weeks while i was digging for ways to fix this and cleaning our apartment top to bottom they were avoiding the apartment completely hoping the problem would go away on its own so thats not really an option

option   could i try to sign another lease in my current apartment theres a few reasons why this couldnt work for one thing this house is over a hundred years old filled with an infinite amount of cracks and crevices in the floors the walls and the ceiling if i stayed the bed bugs wouldnt be going anywhere the only way to possibly eliminate them would be for everyone to move out and for an exterminator to spray every inch of this place and then some even then it probably wouldnt work because theyd have burrowed deep into the floorboards to wait out the insecticide and theyd just resurface in a year or so likewise ive burned some serious bridges with the pm company and my downstairs neighbors and im not on good terms with either for reasons i wont go into here

option   couch surf with someone throw my belongings into storage and find another place to stay shortterm or longterm same result as option   if i came to you asking for shelter and you knew i had bed bugs would you let me stay in your house even though i take all my precautions there is still a very slight possibility i could carry a single bug into your house would you take that risk even if someone consented i couldnt bear it if i accidentally carried bed bugs into the home of a friend or family member even if it technically wouldnt be my fault i wouldnt forgive myself for making that decision also my small collection of friends and family have told me point blank that im not allowed into their homes even just to visit so thats out

option   find a place to live on my own without implicating a new roommate you might remember me mentioning my bottomless pit of at least three kinds of debt add to that my feeble salary and the shithole of an economy weve got on our hands and you know why ive accepted that ill be living with roommates for at least another ten years i just cant afford it otherwise thats where my mind would have been too

option   dont tell megan go about my precautions and cleaning process continue to have the exterminator spray the place down and continue to be hypervigilant for the months and years to come if im lucky and if i do everything right we might never need to have the conversation this last one is what im leaning into the most and i know that makes me a coward

im not thinking clearly and i know that i have two jobs one fulltime and one parttime and im using energy drinks every day just to stay awake something i dont like doing i had so many plans and vacations scheduled for this summer and every single one has gone straight out the window in the past year i had collected a number of furniture items a couch a desk a dresser and a new mattress and box spring to name a few that are all on the curb or soon will be im starting over from scratch and have flushed hundreds soon to be thousands of dollars down the drain suffice to say my mental health has deteriorated im exhausted and scared and i dont know what to do i feel like im constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown and im tearing at the seams the worst part is that i cant really talk to anyone about it because the fear of bed bugs can do more harm than the bugs themselves

ive been doing everything i possibly can to fix this all on my own my friends dont want to be anywhere near me and my mother and sister are empathetic to my problem but have no way to help no one will step foot in my house not even my current roommate who still lives here while theres a possibility i can resolve this before moving theres a small part of me that knows several months from now i will find more bedbugs i will have brought megan into this mess without telling her and that will be what kills me

im sorry im trying very hard to think rationally but im just so tired ive never felt so hopeless and depressed ive been talking to my therapist about it but she hasnt really been helping so i guess now im turning to prostrating myself in front of a jury composed of internet strangers

so whats the verdict what would you do

im posting this to multiple threads hoping to pick up some traction im in desperate need of advice and opinions

edit i am leaving the apartment i live in where i found the bed bugs and will be moving into a new apartment altogether with megan im trying to get rid of them so i dont carry any with me to the new place sorry for any confusion

edit im sorry this is such a long post it started out as a personal brain dump that i copy and pasted into a reddit post with very few edits theres a lot of extra bits i probably didnt need
several years ago i male then in late s was friends with a female colleague and i was walking her home i liked her but apparently she didnt like me romantically i tried to put my arm on her shoulder and she swirled out of it i tried to do a few times and got the same reaction so i eventually stopped doing that and took her home

after taking her home on my way back i realized that i was trying to touch her without her consent i apologized to her via text message and she said it was okay after that we remained friends and did friendly activies such as playing sports together and exchanging gifts we are still friends i think

but the fact that i tried to touch her without her consent still haunts me after many years i apologized to her again last year and she still said it was okay but i cant forgive myself even if she forgave me i feel like the worst person ever

i dont know this is whether because of my ocd obsessive compulsive disorder or because i really did something that bad and should feel eternally bad about it i cant rate my past objectively

what if other people find out that i did this will my friends stop being my friends will i lose my job

am i still qualified to find a romantic partner in my life if so should i confess to my future partner about what i did would it be dishonest to hide this past from her

please rate the badness of what i did in your opinion
so i attribute making this mistake to the worsening and more longterm effects of my anxiety

i had to make a decision on a school and chose the much more expensive and slightly more reputable one at first based on prestige cause i thought thats how you get ahead in life

my dad who i have a conflicting relationship with would pay for it put down a  deposit to secure the place

but i just couldnt deal with having him pay k for an media and film studies masters even from a very good school cause theyre just so manipulative with money so at the last minute i chose the super slightly less well ranked one so i could do a work study program were not getting that k back

i know its a super privilege problem but its not really about the schools

im worried my anxiety is going to become so overwhelming at more and more important and pivotal points in my life and i wont always be able to afford or change my wrong decisions i just freeze and cant think for myself im so terrified im not part of this reality enough to understand it and therefore have good judgment
whenever i cook for my sister or mom i like to add a shit ton of unnecessary oils and fat to add extra calories the root of it is ofc from my ed but idk it just makes me feel better abt myself edit i over did my story a lil and it came off really weirdo vibes when it comes to my ed im really restrictive with fats and shit so even just a drop is excessive for them i add a normal amount plus an extra  tbs lol still bad mhhhh ik
my coworkers have a tendency to stop using an item in middle of its shelflife and throw it at the dumpster before it has been used before it gets thrown at the landfill i hijack it and take it back to use there might be  opened packages of still supposedly usable goods and they dont want to use it instead they open a new one i also improvise opened dates i see a open package thats in use i will put a date on it that it was opened yesterday i justify my bad behauvior by reminding myself that my coworkers too do shady things all the time i also have environmental ocd ive been caught few times and some of my coworkers do the same thing as i do its unlikely that i cause any harm because the product lasts  week after opening leaving almost full opened products at the far end of some cabinet is really common ive mentioned this to my boss and ive filed rapports so i decided to take matters in my own hands
when i was younger there was a dude who only contacted me couple times a year to get nudes from me this was completely fine for me and it went on for years i met an older guy later in my life and every time he gets annoying or scary i block him then i contact him the next year have a talk and block him again
i thankfully got my shit together moved out and no longer do that ive never told anyone this including my girlfriend of  years 
so i attribute making this mistake to the worsening and more longterm effects of my anxiety 

i had to make a decision on a school and chose the much more expensive and slightly more reputable one at first based on prestige cause i thought thats how you get ahead in life

my dad who i have a conflicting relationship with would pay for it put down a  deposit to secure the place

im worried my anxiety is going to become so overwhelming at more and more important and pivotal points in my life and i wont always be able to afford or change my wrong decisions i just freeze and cant think for myself im so terrified im not part of this reality enough to understand it and therefore have good judgment
i feel i react and feel in such an alien way to everyone else im just usually quite good at masking it

i dont feel at home in this world at all
never saw myself as a threatening or intimidating person i kept waiting for them to push me away or hit me or something that was the sign i was looking for they had told me no and stop but they were laughing when they said it possibly because of feeling nervous the feeling i get to even type this is very bad i cant even use the proper words here as i feel sick to see them
the stories ive made up are so bizarre im ashamed

hi

i bought my adultdoll xxx toy a couple of years ago and hid it in the hunting room hidden from my wife last year i decided to throw away the doll it felt completely wrong to use it in secret from the wife

decided to get rid of the doll somewhere out in nature isnt room in a normal boss bin and its embarrassing to take it to the landfill therefore had a spade to dig it into the forest drove off but i suddenly had bad timing and panicked and thus ended up throwing it on the side of the road

tragicomic as it all was it ended up with the doll being found by people the next day someone who was on their way to work and got a little shock it made headlines in the local newspaper some regional and one national newspaper  the dd was never traced back to me

proof of newspaper
when i was a kid probably about  or  i cut my own hair i was old enough to know that if i cut all of it my parents would know and be furious so instead i cut just a small section no bigger than the width of a pencil right in the middle of my head all the way to the scalp i wanted the hair to braid and decorate my barbies with i stabbed them in the head to make a hole and stuck the hair in it i thought that if i cut it at the scalp no one would ever know and it did work for like a week until my hair started to grow again i had what looked like either a pecock crown or the kid from the diary of a wimpy kid for ages of course i denied it and blamed my yearold sister i was persistent and my parents believed that she snuck into my room and cut my hair in my sleep its been  years and i still havent admitted the truth and bring it up every time i see her we live far apart so probably  times a year the worst part is that i think i have gaslit her into believing it too im sure ill admit it one day to her but no time soon 
i had social anxiety growing up so id do anything to avoid conversation or attention one time i went to a function to kill some time i went alone there were no one familiar i was in my uniform i was just roaming around and really enjoying my time then three women approached me they were interested in my school as i was in my uniform naturally they asked me about my school and i panicked i knew some basic sign language so i started to sign they were confused at first but caught up real fast they smiled kindly at me and asked my name i showed them my school id one of them gave me a box of cupcakes she bought and patted my shoulder wishing me a great day i felt so bad more after i ate the cupcakes i didnt deserve those
so lately ive noticed that i lie about almost everything it could be what im eating what im doing or i just lie about the most random stuff i dont notice when i do it but later on i notice what i said i dont know why it happens but ive lied about pretty much everything to everyone does anyone else have this
im  as is this friend who for simplicitys sake i will refer to as nick and weve known each other since  ive always been terrible at making friends and i truly mean it when i say that he is the only actual friend i have other than basic superficial friends who i dont interact with outside of school im more or less his only friend too and weve been reliant upon each other for  years

a month or so ago someone from another friend group at school asked nick if he wanted to hang out with them i immediately became terrified of the idea that nick could potentially leave me and join this other group of people who by the way despise me so i immediately started to convince him that it was a bad idea eventually leading to me making flat out false screenshots of them speaking about nick negatively to prove that it wasnt worth it he eventually agreed with me and decided to not go through with the plans

now i know for a fact that hed be better off with them than me plain and simple theyre objectively better company than hanging around with me and i know hed be much happier but my fear of abandonment is so strong and i so cannot imagine a life where i dont have a singular friend that i cant bring myself to let go of him and now the guilt is eating me up alive its all i can think about every time i see him all i can think of is how im denying him a better social life out of my own selfishness i think hes noticed somethings up with me he asked me recently why i looked so miserable all of a sudden but i cant bear to tell him what i did i know for a fact he like me wants to branch out and have other friends i should have let him give it a try but i didnt and now i feel so terrible about it he deserves far better and i really dont know what to do were both definitely not in the best place mentally either and i know for a fact he deserves friends who actually have their lives sorted out unlike myself but again my brain cannot convince itself to actually do whats right and tell him the truth that i ruined his chance of making new friends for my own selfish gain i dont know what to do
when i f was in kindergarten my apartment complex had a play ground close by i would constantly go to that park with my younger brother and goof off for hours there was a little boy who would come by and always try to play with us i convinced my brother to speak a fake language and act like we had no idea what he was saying but would still play with him this included a lot of pretending to not understand what was happening but the little boy would go along with it one day at the park by myself the little boy came up and i had forgotten my language obviously the little boy was shocked and thought i was lying the whole time so i had to come clean im a twin and i speak english while my sister doesnt which is not true at all im not a twin and i dont speak another other languages  from there on out when i wasnt with my brother i was my twin deep memory that randomly came up i wonder if that little boy ever thinks about it 
i worked at a grocery store and we had a courtesy counter where people would bring cans and bottles for cooperage it was  cents for cans and  cents for longneck bottles i would count the cans if they had  cans i would write down  open the register give the customer  and put  in my pocket i did this all the time

i would also empty packs of soda and refill them with beer tape them shut and buy them

the store was a good place to work and the owners were good people they still have no idea i hate it it gnaws at me
ive seen confessions about pretending to have a job but i actually have a job i just pretend to work more hours than i actually do

it started seven years ago when i had a controlling boyfriend who i felt smothered and suffocated by if i told him i needed alone time he would show up or drive by my place unannounced so i pretended to work on my days off 

that relationship ended but i continued to do it  with friends family and even other guys i dated i was caught once and accused of cheating i talked my way out of it but i wonder whats worse  cheating or pretending to be at work to avoid spending time with my boyfriend

im not even in a relationship right now and im still doing it i cant seem to stop im really introverted and need more alone time than most people its easier to pretend to be at work than to say i dont feel like hanging out 

and because i have a job its harder for me to get caught because half the time i say im working i actually am at work i dont know if ill ever stop


edit
thanks for all the great feedback i greatly appreciate it to answer a few questions i am on the spectrum and i do have anxiety i have trouble setting keeping boundaries and i tend to let people push my limits or step over them completely i have a hard time saying no and i hate hurting peoples feelings 

i also do present as an extrovert in social situations so i tend to make friends with people who are more social than me in the past ive dated guys who are more extroverted than i am i have felt smothered and suffocated in most of my romantic relationships i always thought there was something wrong with me but i just didnt know how to fix it

i am in therapy for severe cptsd and i have an anxiousavoidant attachment style i will keep trying to get better thank you

once a week at around  pm i throw my trash bags into my car drive to either a random neighbourhood or near the river where i dump some of my trash bags into and i litter the trash bags either in the middle of the road or between peoples parked automobiles in the most bizarre places whenever i am in a fast food joint such as a burger king i litter my garbage on the washroom floor or dump it on the side of the road all my trash never makes it into a proper bin
this was so long ago but ive seen some heinous confessions on this app and i find mine quite funny although i may be bias lol

when i was in kindergarten i remember that i tried to convince everyone around me that i had a twin sister that looked and sounded exactly like me and that everyday we would switch places

i know that it sounds quite stupid and unbelievable and yet i was like five years old and im pretty sure at least ten children believed me 

i distinctly remember that multiple times a day kids would ask me about my twin and then the next day ask my twin about me i promise i had definitely tricked one kid into thinking i actually had a twin

no adults ended up hearing about it or they just didnt care and left me alone to manipulate my classmates into believing stupid shit

cant remember exactly when i stopped lying or if anyone confronted me about it but i found this a lighter confession

so dont yell at me for more information because i cant help you with that
a little background info i started talking to this guy romantically about a year ago and hes  years older than me i was introduced to him by my best friend which is also his cousin who lives with him so like i said before weve been on and off talking for about a year and a half in addition he just moved to america in  from mexico so he doesnt really know much english when i first spoke to him he didnt know any at all my friend also told me about him not speaking english when she first gave me his number so i was well aware of it in that time i had already been learning spanish for a while about  months but i still wasnt anywhere near fluent but in my head i believed my spanish was good enough 

the moment we started talking is when i realized damn i didnt know bat shit in spanish but  he was so handsome i decided to settle with the deepl translator there was many times he asked me how i learned spanish and many times he told me that my spanish was good there was even a time where i jokingly said i dont speak spanish and he responded in spanish with oh so have you been using a translator to talk with me  and i responded back saying once or twice i always think about that text because i feel like i shouldve been honest with him at that point 

there was also times where he tried to call me and i had made an excuse and the conversations after that would be awkward now that time has passed its been more than calls ive made excuses for there was multiple times he asked me to come over and i had to make an excuse because i was too scared to get caught on how little spanish i knew in person but how fluent i was in text i always try to motivate myself to learn more spanish for him and others in general because of how beneficial it is but i cant bring myself to stay motivated 

in a few months i will be attending his school and im bervous on if he ever sees me and tries to speak to me now he seems to be getting dry with me every time i make up a new excuse on why i cant go to his house one time he even called me a mentirosa liar when i told him i couldnt hes told me many times that he only wants me and that he likes me but i dont want to commit with my lies i dont know what to do and if i should just be honest but i also dont want to ruin my chances with him at the moment i do know more spanish in the advanced to intermediate level but still not enough for a a day with a native  

update thank you for all the honest and nice feedback about my situation i am going to tell him the truth today or tomorrow i was supposed to tell him yesterday n i was too busy but shocker i am going to his house next thursday so hopefully you guys see that as an step forward and i will make sure to tell him today or tomorrow dont get mad at me its been a year so its not easy to tell him and scared on how hes gonna react atm i am spending    hours on week days practicing spanish  and  on weekends so yeswere getting there
i used to work out back and restock the shelves the bosses would go home by pm and id be there alone till pm to deal woth everything i was  last year of high school i barely ate food during the day as my family were poor 
the boss said if theres ever a broken carton or opened box on the shelves  i was to take it down and throw it in the bin id throw hundreds of perfectly good food away
so when the boss went home i would take the food go to the cold room eat and drink until i was full then get back to work i was eating expensive bakery products to chocolates to anything and everything i could never afford
i quit working there after  months
this is not a story where i gave up vaping but secretly still do but something else  weeks ago me and a friend gave up vaping and to celebrate we are going to zion national park for a week long hiking and camping trip with our stronger lungs we made each other accountability partners and as far as i know we both are still in the game 

i read up on withdrawal management and loaded up and made baskets with ibuprofen benadryl mints jolly ranchers gum nonnicotine that people suggested to help quit we even ran over our vapes in the walmart parking lot 

i do not have a single regret except i did not do it sooner i honestly thank the lord above for it but when i tell you i had the tiniest levels of withdrawals from quitting nicotine that was a nasty habit for  years i am not lying i had a tiny headache on the third day but apart from that and just some minor ooo a minty hit would be so nice i am fine and i want my money back from all the time i wasted on that stupid habit 

my friend is not in the same boat i still get calls when we talk that she cant sleep well binge eats migraines etc the first couple days every night she would be crying about how shit she felt i am honestly proud that she didnt go back 

this isnt about how im annoyed at her im proud and the pact to be accountability partners makes it my responsibility to be there because i thought i would be like that and i would like the same treatment from her shes never taken anger out on me different body reactions i guess

i didnt want to discourage her or make her feel alone by saying my journey has been easy so i just try to match her energy i lie and say i been having killer headaches and cant sleep and am raging at tiny shit hell i graduated college and am currently living with my parents until my grownup career starts and then im on my own im stressed af and hate seeing my friend in pain so i cried with her 

but its all been fake i feel fine had one minor headache that could have been from caffeine withdrawal cuz i didnt have coffee that day but i have zero cravings or anything i just want us to better ourselves and quit the stupid habit 

i started vaping in mid november to try and fit in with certain crowds and make friends however i later realized that it isnt the right way to get true friends im also an athlete i play soccer and i know its not healthy to vape especially at a younger age but i cant help it i love the way it makes me zone out and forget everything going on all that stress at home just disappears for a bit i told my bf my mom and some friends that i quit but i feel a lot of guilt lying to them when i clearly didnt quit
i m am an awful person 
   i grew up in a very unhealthy household my parents were addicts and my parents were neglectful and abusive my older siblings were the only people around me who cared for me and i have consistently lied and manipulated them after my parents split up when i was  my parents remarried my mother married a decent enough man he was an angry person and he took it out on me but he wasnt totally awful i exaggerated about the way he treated me to my mother and she left him 
    when my mom left him i  moved in with my brother he treated me well but we argued about opinions i payed him about  a month in rent but it didnt work out because of our arguments i then moved in with my oldest sibling
    they were the sibling that raised me i once again payed  a month the plan was to save up and get my own place i was saving but i kept on impulsively spending money i stayed with them for  years i was welcome there but i never managed to make a considerable savings every time they asked me about my savings i lied i didnt want to but i couldnt bring myself to tell the truth once i started lying about that i found myself lying to other people about anything i do it because i feel like making things up about myself is the only way to make people like me
   i feel like a deep void where a person should be
i have moved but im still staying with a family member across the country i dont know what to do i constantly feel depressed and suicidal i moved to try and start new i have been trying to save again to some success and ive been trying to stop lying but my old lies come back to bite me and i have to lie again to keep images up
      the worst part is that i know something is severely wrong with me ive known that from a young age ive only ever felt sadness and anger but i cant seem to help myself

edit thank you all for the responses im going to take your advice and look for therapy ive never done it before so this feels like a big step
when i was in elementary school my mom used to stock up on supradyn energy one day i tried it and it was like a citrus explosion in my mouth better than any orange juice id ever had whether it was my young taste buds or the actual flavor i was hooked

fast forward to th grade and digimon mania was sweeping through my school the craze wasnt just about watching the anime there was this sticker collection book you had to fill with stickers hidden under yogurt lids being a massive digimon fan i knew every character attack evolution and could belt out the opening theme by heart i just couldnt let it slide but there was a hitch my family was pretty humble and splurging on mountains of yogurt wasnt an option asking my parents for extra cash was also out of the question

so i devised a plan i started smuggling supradyn energy tablets and a l bottle to school mixing up the magic potion in the bathroom and selling cups of this orange juice to my classmates during recess on my first day the entire bottle was emptied in  minutes flat business was booming

for a whole week i ran my little enterprise under the radar none of the teachers noticed except for the coolest one ever my thgrade teacher mr sarhani rip you were the realest he actually found my scheme hilarious especially after i explained my digimon sticker dilemmamy mom never caught on because she thought my dad was using the tablets too

 but eventually the jig was up kids were bouncing off the walls with energy and the teachers started asking questions when they asked the kids what they had been snacking on i realized oh no its probably the juice im selling so i decided to quit while i was ahead

in the end i made enough money to almost complete my digimon collection book it wasnt about the money though those last few stickers were ultrarare but hey i gave it my best shot and had a blast doing it
in context to my confession i recently just moved out of state which as most of us know is financially draining with moving to this new state i needed a new internet provider to cut cost i bought a modem from the fb marketplace to my surprise the company informed me i would still have to pay a rental fee for the modem because technically it was theres with that in mind i refused to pay and sold it off to someone else a few weeks pass and the person i sold it to says they cannot get it activated mind you i wrote in the description that a rental fee would still be necessary i feel bad because they want a refund 
i work a job on campus im a student interviewing and hiring other students if theyre obviously not what the job needs they get booted off everything is fair until theres a tie between a number of students more than we can afford to hire after careful evaluation i choose to hire the top most charming and attractive girls and the bottom of the barrel guys its good for business

 a less serious post on here im a very funny person everyone always tells me i have a great sense of humor and i was voted class clown for my senior superlative when i was younger i was doing a skit for my parents i stole the joke from a vine i had seen they erupted with laughter they still reference the joke to this day and are always damned they never video taped it 
throwaway account as this friend most definitely knows about my main reddit account im  as is this friend who for simplicitys sake i will refer to as nick and weve known each other since  ive always been terrible at making friends and i truly mean it when i say that he is the only actual friend i have other than basic superficial friends who i dont interact with outside of school im more or less his only friend too and weve been reliant upon each other for  years

a month or so ago someone from another friend group at school asked nick if he wanted to hang out with them i immediately became terrified of the idea that nick could potentially leave me and join this other group of people who by the way despise me so i immediately started to convince him that it was a bad idea eventually leading to me making flat out false screenshots of them speaking about nick negatively to prove that it wasnt worth it he eventually agreed with me and decided to not go through with the plans

now i know for a fact that hed be better off with them than me plain and simple theyre objectively better company than hanging around with me and i know hed be much happier but my fear of abandonment is so strong and i so cannot imagine a life where i dont have a singular friend that i cant bring myself to let go of him and now the guilt is eating me up alive its all i can think about every time i see him all i can think of is how im denying him a better social life out of my own selfishness i think hes noticed somethings up with me he asked me recently why i looked so miserable all of a sudden but i cant bear to tell him what i did i know for a fact he like me wants to branch out and have other friends i should have let him give it a try but i didnt and now i feel so terrible about it he deserves far better and i really dont know what to do were both definitely not in the best place mentally either and i know for a fact he deserves friends who actually have their lives sorted out unlike myself but again my brain cannot convince itself to actually do whats right and tell him the truth that i ruined his chance of making new friends for my own selfish gain i dont know what to do 

is confessing all this on reddit the best course of action probably not im just at a dead end

we had a competition to write a short narrative while i was in primary school so i would have been nine or ten years old the assignment was to be finished in one class regardless ive always had a passion for writing a knack with words and a desire of being a writer that never quite worked out it was probably my first instance of writers block i was at a loss for words and frantically scribbled meaningless words down on the page over and over until it dawned on me that i had just seen a new goosebumps episode i then recorded it in writing as far as i could recall the entire episode goddamn goosebumps moment
edit im busy at work now but will try to reply to some comments later i am beyond grateful for so many kind responses i definitely cried to many of them i had absolutely no clue this type of thing was so common and im honestly a bit angry that so much of my trauma couldve been avoided but at least now i can begin to heal so thank you guys

sigh this wont be short but i never talk about this memory because of how uncomfortable it makes me feel and how much shame i carry  years ago my parents had left me and my siblings with a new babysitter that evening and went out to a town about  minutes away there was older brother ob age  older sister os age  me age  younger brother yb age  and youngest brother age  who well call al the babysitter was 
so sometime that evening i was playing with al in the upstairs area of the house babysitter was tutoring yb with violin in the room he and al shared what i remember is tickling al and just having a blast horsing around together in my parents room to mess with him i got up and ran to ybs room  and closed the door on him like haha you cant catch me but im gonna open the door in  seconds he was right behind me and if i remember correctly had fallen on his butt outside the door 
im getting sick to my stomach typing this but my little perfect baby brother al being  used the doorframe to pull himself up and as i closed the door the tip of his pointer finger right around the nail line was caught in the door hinges its really a blur but he screamed and i immediately opened the door and i saw him holding up his tiny bloodied finger it was pretty much hanging by a thread the babysitter ran over and we all were freaking out she called my parents and they immediately set on their way home as my dad was a doctor and planned to suture it back on while we were waiting everyone was huddling around al trying to comfort him and also slow the bleeding i was shunned to my room by who i can remember at least ob all my siblings were very angry with me
luckily my dad was able to completely repair the trauma to his finger and he is left with a little scar where it was sutured on when my parents came home i recall looks and feelings of disgust from them towards me i felt so isolated in my whole family like no matter how much i said it they couldnt accept my apology or forgive me my parents shamed me for what couldve cost my brother part of his finger and emphasized how it couldve impacted his ability to play violin 
for several years i was terrified of doors for other people my siblings continued to run around slamming doors and i would cry and freak out and beg them to stop and say someones finger might get caught i still get flashbacks to the event that really disturb me but when i was younger it was much more intense
ive struggled with suicidal thoughtsbehaviors a lot throughout my life but i can distinctly remember that night being the very first time right after the incident when i wasnt allowed to be near al i just kept thinking and saying i wanna kill myself i wanna die i deserve to die i felt and to this day feel so terrible for my mistake and so stupid

i have been shoplifting since i was maybe in my early teens it all began with me and my friends at the time wanting to have to fun together so we decided to steal from one of the close corner shops near my house since i had invited them over we had walked in i had grabbed a drink and a pack of cigarettes from behind the counter while my mate distracted the clerk by asking him questions we left after the clerk shouted at him to leave him alone from then on it almost became like an addiction anytime i would go to the shops i just had to take something nothing could stop me not even my friends who were there with me could stop me from stealing i became good i mean really good to the point where i could take anything from anywhere clothes food jewellery you name it and i could pinch it from the nearest shop that sold it i didnt permanently stop until my late thirties and even then it was so hard to quit i have matured now and i realise what ive done was wrong but in the moment it felt so good to take something the adrenaline that would course through my veins would be like a high anywho do i need help is there something wrong with me suggestions 
ive been living with the thought that i scarred someone for years and i just want to hear if others think it is as serious as i find it to be it starts at an old school maybe  years old or something like that i get in a class which hint hint ended up being probably the most mentally traumatic part of my life ive ever experienced and i immediately met friends targets and enemies there was a group of foreigners probably arabic of some sort and they immediately started bullying me because of my less severe adhd and autism they found it funny that i got angry easily i was a shy little bitch so i didnt want to hurt anyone but eventually they just bullied me to the point where i got pushed into being a mentally deranged psychopath willing to beat up anyone in my path 

  
usually id take my anger out on a girl named victoria she was obviously a victim of some sort of intellectual based diagnose of more heavy harm than mine and it was sort of just a perfect target she couldnt have her own argument she didnt even know which finger on her hand was the middle finger ofcourse i never actually hit her since she moved from the school in nd grade probably on behalf of her parents im sort of happy that she did because that was around when i started hitting anyone in my path

  
before i started getting violent with others i usually just pushed them down slides they were too scared of basically psychological warfare 

  
the really bad thing about this is that i ran on pills like elvanse ritalin and others this hit me hard as a kid when i was  i lost so much weight that i weighed about  kilos it hit me physically and mentally i would either get angrier or calmer if i got angrier i ate more if i got calmer i ate nothing we ended up ditching the pills when i turned  since i grew up and could do things properly i also didnt get diagnosed with autism until i was  so i was given completely incorrect treatments hitting me even more 

  
i ofcourse took several of these things to principals and teachers but as said that school had really no precautions teachers had full right to just not give a fuck which is exactly what they did  of the time 

  
ask me whatever tell me whatever i probably wont answer alot since im not reddit much but i just want to know if its as bad as it really is
my brother got a ps on christmas last year he wanted to play the new spiderman and so did i after he completed his play through i started my own on the hardest difficulty i was pretty good at elden ring well i loved the game up to the lizard boss fight its the hardest level ive ever played in any game ever so about around my th try on this boss i just lost it 

in a fit of anger i threw his controller on the floor and broke it its just a controller i had enough money to get him a new one so i take a break and go get some drinks after getting home and getting buzzed i retried to play and beat the boss i still couldnt beat him so i turned it to the easier difficulty and i still kept losing so i grabbed the ps and smashed it on our sidewalk he gets back home in  days its been a good run 
ok this is weird taken out of context but basically it was my second term of being in a catholic school and a new library was being made requested by the principle it was there all big and massive the books were all stored on a shelf and stuff the reason i called it the whitest school ever was because im asian and i had never been to a library stacked with white people before sure there was some mixed race there but a majority of them were white especially with their blond hair but anyway during that time i felt like i needed to go to the toilet badly so bad in fact that i felt like i had a bladder infection so i went to one of the new toilet stall that was being made look down on the ground and walked into one of the toilet there were two bathroom stalls and i went to one of them pulled my pants down and started pissing on the bowl so aggressive that i swore i heard a girls giggle and that was when i thought i was in the wrong bathroom so i pulled my underwear and pants up i felt a fucking sense of embarrassment flew right through me when i ran out of the bathroom and found this one girl who was lesbian in my english class screamed after i ran out and pass her two days later my principle was talking with me and i got suspended for four days four days later my mum and i were sitting in front of the principles assistant basically shes just your average stereotypical fat american woman staring at me and we begin to talk and heres the part of the story i was so grateful for after they finish talking she looked at me and told me why did you piss everywhere in the toilet bowl so i said to her i had a foreskin surgery hence why i couldnt control my penis so i pissed everywhere on the floor as an excuse and that was last year and im still at the school
you heard that right year old me had more money than he could comprehend

i started my robbing streak by finding out the family safe and its combinationboth my parents debit cards and exactly where they hide their cash i also had just brought a second hand ps with the original owners debit card in it

the peak of the robbing was when i had  vbucks  gems in the game called brawl stars thousands of robux i was also hosting tournaments in these games between my classmates with winners getting an ingame or real life price in the form of currency

on the nondigital side i have stolen well over  in us dollars from my dad and more than  us dollars from my mom 

it all ended when ai was  my parents found out about most of my robberies and threatened to leave me at the adoption center where thy got me from god damn do i feel bad still i feel every bad feeling that i could feel and it isnt like i didnt knew i was spending irl money in a gamei knew that very well

i havent stole more than a fanta bottle ever since
i work in sr management at a pretty significant company we recent started posting for some manager level positions 

my kids both play hockey and over the winter we played alot of games before this one kids rep team the kid is a jerk he plays his music loud in common areas he shoots the ball around in the hallways away from the rink and has hit a few kids he goes to stick and puck and steals the pucks from kids just learning how to play like i said an overall jerk

evey time i see his dad just sitting around chatting with his friends ignoring his kids actions

so imagine my suprise when i see the dad in front of me for an interview i have never actually spoken to him or know his name he obviously had no idea who i was as the interview went on all i could think about was how his kid must have learned that jerky behaviors from somewhere and what can i expect from someone who lets his kid act this way

he interviewed very well in fact i thought he was the best but decided to pass on him just because of his jerky kid im sure he has no idea im curious if he says hi to me at the rink
i stole a bottle of liquor from my uncle when i was in high school i left his back door unlocked so i can sneak back in and take a bottle once he left it was a brand new bottle of caption morgan i always wondered if he knows lol
so its been almost a year since i moved cities in order to go to college i was excited af cuz my parents have been overprotective all my life and i wanted some freedom what i got instead was a feeling of alienation and loneliness i have always had a lot of anxiety growing up mostly with socials situations because i wasnt allowed to go out alone in my childhood the first time i went to a friends birthday without my parents or a guardian was in th grade yes im not kidding i felt depressed and very lonely i didnt feel like going to the college because the crowd is unironically just a bunch of bigots and i cant stand them i started to become an alcoholic and a smoker since i was not going to my college i didnt submit any of my assignments and that pretty much fucked up my internals for the first year and now i have to score a lot in my exams in order to just pass in a particular subject yesterday my dad calls me and says i know everything dont think that i dont cuz i know everything in front of my mother tooandt then well they do know everything for the last  hours stuff has gotten sad man like they are insanely disappointed and i dont blame them i tried explaining some of my issues and how sad ive been but well they think these are just excuses and start comparing me to other kids and what not

this is not me trying to justify my behavior i do want to get better my parents have my college portal id now and they have said that they will check it everyday from next sem and that if something like this happens again they will put me in a rehab center and i can say good bye to college 

ps i have been sober for  weeks
this happened a month or so ago i havent told anyone in my personal life because im so ashamed for my actions but i really need to get this off my chest 

for her birthday my friend wanted to take a hiking trip with our group of friends and the site was a  minute drive away we had to split our group into two cars and mine was one we took we all planned on doing mushrooms and enjoying nature but i wanted mine to kick in by the time we got there so i took my dose right before we left the timing was completely off and they kicked in after around min while i was in the middle of driving on a long stretch of highway which was one lane in each direction 

everything was fine we were joking and chatting but i felt like i shouldnt be driving however the other people in the car were also on shrooms so i decided to suck it up at one point we got behind a car that was significantly slower than what we were going before and my friend told me just go around them and without a second thought i did not noticing the other car driving straight at us in the opposing lane 

im shaking as i type this but we were stuck between both cars unable to merge if that car didnt swerve off the road we would have crashed head on at mph and it would have been completely my fault i felt so incredibly guilty and stupid for being on shrooms and driving for putting my friends lives in danger they got over it quickly and went back to chatting probably because by the grace of god we survived but i was silent the rest of the drive fighting a panic attack

we opted not to tell the rest of the group as we didnt want them to worry and one was already apprehensive about us driving i havent told anyone else and we havent talked about it since but i cant shake the fear i had and my regret im never doing something this stupid again i think about it every day
i lie about things that dont really matter for literally no reason and dont know how to stop obviously this is something i should talk to my therapist about but its something ive been struggling with and am having a hard time admitting that i do it i dont know why i never lie about things that actually matter because i have no reason to i tend to lie about stuff to make myself look interesting or to appear more fun than i am to people ive become more comfortable with who i actually am within the past few years and instead of admitting my lies ive just started doing what i lied about an example would be telling someone i play a lot of souls games why even though i dont own any so recently i just started playing ive never had a valid reason to lie or learn to lie as well as i do why do i lie about this stuff and is doing what i lied about after the fact enough reconciliation
this was a long time ago i was a skater in my s  the manager at burger king had so much attitude i felt he deserved it

they ran a promotional scratchcard a grid of  squares 
scratch off any single row if it contains  matching symbols you won that item 

the options were fries drink or whopper 

so having worked out that the odds were ridiculously slim it annoyed me so off i went to burger king 

it was always minimally staffed so as soon as the server turned her back i grabbed a huge stack of cards they were free after all 

every time i went every time the server turned her back i grabbed more always keeping the stack in order 

now id worked out that the way to win was fully scratch a card off to establish which line was the winner then scratch off that corresponding line on the next until it stopped winning 

then completely scratch that one off rinse  repeat 


this meant only about one in thirty didnt win rather than the ridiculously long odds bk intended 

the second best part of all this was the manager quizzing me then getting visibly annoyed at my ive always been lucky explanation but being unable to explain the impossible probabilities of being that lucky 


but by far my favourite part was getting a burger off the manager getting my scratchcard sitting down  appearing to scratch it off but swapping it for a pre scratched one then shouting yes free whopper 

he literally ran over  inspected my card every which way 

poor man 


i wasnt keen on coke or fries so gave them all away to the younger skaters who then absolutely pillaged the place 


id have loved to have been a fly on the wall for the how much extra money did you make off the promo area meeting 

im betting over  of the winners of their promo were just me 


when i was about  my dad took my brothers and i to blockbuster to rent some movies as was our weekly routine i really wanted to get milk duds but my dad wouldnt let me while waiting in line to check out i stood in front of the candy kiosk and discretely opened up a box of milk duds slipping a single dud out of the box and into my mouth im pretty sure i didnt chew or swallow it until we were safely out of the store

i was so terrified i was going to get in trouble for this for months and probably years after the incident certain that there must have been a security camera that captured my actions i was convinced that after someone reviewed that security footage they would come knocking on my door to punish me for my horrible crime every time we went back to blockbuster i was walking on egg shells trying to put on a performance as the most polite and lawabiding citizen child not wanting to tip anyone off to what i had been capable of 

i was unsurprisingly never caught for the incident but felt a twang of guilt for years after every time i set foot in a blockbuster 
ive never told anyone this but back in february im  i mixed oxys xanax citlopram chieffed the fuck out my pennot drugs but whatever shit ton of benadryl microdose of crack the tiniest bit of shrooms like a little bit of the stem and hit my vape like  times i washed it all down with water and a jack in the box taco i bought before i went to school my school has vape detectors and they called me to the office abt the vape detectors going off while i was in there they searched my bag and found all that shit they called my parents and i got sent to a alternative school then i just went online i didnt overdose all that happened that i felt i was dying and i threw up all day after that  
i have had a really terrible week but im not on rventing so im not gonna go into it last night i seriously considered committing but today my sat scores came out and i got a  a kind of bad score if i want to go to college and everyone was sharing thier scores so i was gonna joke with them i have always been considered a dumbass i am in geometry as a junior there is freshman above me in math level and i am failing all my classes so i was like nobody is going to believe that i got a high score so i just inspect elemented my score to say   in emglish and  in math for those who dont know  is the max you can get and nobody at my school has ever gotten above  i dont think so i posted it in my gc then everyone started complementing me congratulating me for such a good job and how proud they are of me i posted it on my story people i have never talked to told me how amazing that was i feel so loved yesterday i was going to try and kill myself i had no friends nobody cared i was just the dumbass who couldnt do anything right but now people are proud of me i dont think ive ever heard that before from my friends i dont think in going to tell the truth because this lie isnt hurting anyone and its helping my mental health greatly hopefully this doesnt turn into a dear evan hansen thing
it started a couple months ago when i noticed that he had some new cologne on the way to get food i asked about it and he and he acknowledged it as well as allowing me to spray some on myself i sprayed it on my favorite hoodie and ive gotten used to the feeling of comfort being his scent anytime i get a chance i spray some on me anytime i smell it i breathe in as much as possible it isnt a sexual thing but i dont know what kind of thing it is im concerned about our relationship because i dont want to look weird when asking for a spray of cologne or talking to him or something but no matter what i still love him like a brother

edit to clear up some confusion the name of the cologne is eclipse accord eau de toilette natural spray im a trans man ftm and i now know it isnt sexual at all so stop dming me about sexual shit
after a sober and random day interviewing across town i got nauseous in my uber and didnt ask him to pull over in time  i was obviously sober so i didnt know how else to explain it other than to say i was newly pregnant as he talked about his family and being a father quite a bit during the ride instead of being angry or disgusted he empathized i tipped extra and kept my uber rating intact 
i was immature at  and i didnt look my age and had a baby face i used to go to the store just to throw things at people and run off this one day i threw it at the wrong lady who doesnt like kids in the bathroom aisle this woman had her back turned looking at a product i threw the ball at her leg and ran to another aisle when i ran off i started walking with these two couples as if they were my parents these two couple turned into her aisle and i kept walking straight i saw the woman walking up and down the aisle looking for me she saw a glimpse of me and she asked the couple is that little boy your child they said no she said okay he just threw a ball at me hey you show me where your parents are at you just threw a ball at me i said no i didnt she said yes you did show me where they at i do not deal with little kids

then i led her to my mom as we walked through the aisle literally everyone there was silent and looking at us when we were walking i apologized but she didnt respond when i found mom the woman said to her is this your son she said yes she goes your son threw a ball at me and then he ran off and he thought that i didnt see him i do not play with other peoples kids mom said okay did you say sorry i said yes but the woman said i didnt so i had to apologize again i was genuinely scared of this woman i never threw anything at anybody again
everytime i see them im on coke they have not seen me sober in atleast a year
so i started at a company last year and i was super ambitious and happy to help i did my job and helped when needed 

but the past six months coworkers started giving me their work while they took  hr to  hr lunches talked the entire shift and just hardly worked while they gave me work 

one of these people who gave me extra work was my supervisor but they started just playing on their phone watching shows and just hanging out with her best friend who is also a regular employee 

my supervisor also told our main boss that i was a terrible worker that my desk decorations are childish and that i dont work 

i felt like it was insanely unfair so i stopped doing their work and only focused on my own 

they started getting mad at me for not doing their work but i told them that i had other priorities 

so im working slower than usual so i wont be forced to do others work 
hey guys i have a crazy story last night while i was at my familys vacation house my super cute step cousin came into my bed we always flirted but never thought of this we went from am until  am and it got really intimate we actually orgasmed at the same time because we timed it we also wanted to have me bust inside her looking back on it i dont know what i was thinking
mostly i steal redbulls or candy by slipping them in my pockets in this economy it feels like im taking control and saying fuck you to the man i see it as a victimless crime because obv i only steal from rich corporations and i would never steal from an individual person 
i have a confession to make thats been weighing on me about a year back i intentionally sent a bikini picture to my old married boss but i pretended it was an accident

i cringe every time i think about it i had this idea that if he saw the picture he might take an interest in me outside of work but because i was too afraid to approach him directly i pretended i tried to send it to a fwb and sent to him instead same name

he never said anything about it but i did feel he looked at me differently after am i a bad person

has anyone else ever done something like this how did you deal with the aftermath


im the oldest sister my older brother was the good one he did no wrong in my moms eyes he was allowed to have his gf sleep over 

looking back i snuck out a lot during high school and i snuck my bf in the house too when i got stuck outside i would knock on my little sisters window to open the door my younger siblings seen me sneak out so many times but we all had each others backs so i wasnt worried about them snitching on me 

as they got into high school and having gfbf they started doing what i was doing texting me to unlock the doors for them so i pretty much started the trend for my siblings to sneak out or sneak their gfbf in 

what is that saying monkey see monkey do
or is it normal
my trauma has made me justify some really shitty behavior  

how do i forgive myself should i not should i seek out a diagnosis

i have a weird relationship with food and i have a hard time understanding boundaries sometimes because i have none of my own i have a habit of stealing my roommates food and also other peoples pencils for some reason 
i would go  home for the weekend and i would eat it and then replace it before she came back  i justified it because i always give other people food and i dont really care if they take mine either  however i started to feel extremely guilty for doing this but i also get scared to ask people for things so i would just replace it in hopes she wouldnt find out  i ended up taking two pieces of sour patch kids after she told me not too but then i told her and i apologized profusely  seeing how upset it made her honestly made me feel terrible and so i have never done it again but yeah  its like i felt entitled to it because i wouldnt care and because i always replace it  i know thats wrong  

i would tell myself its just food you wouldnt care if someone took yours its not a big deal but it is  a big deal its a huge disrespect to people and i have stopped doing this 

also when i was working at the high school i substitute at i took a mechanical pencil off the teachers  desk because it was really cool and i kept it for myself  here is a list of all the things ive taken this year 

 a mechanical pencil
 cinnamon toast crunch 
 sour patch kids 
 tampons 

so i was  and hanging with the wrong crowd i would get drunk every so often my brother  years my senior gave me the pw to this myfreepaysite where live models perform for money i would proceed to sit there with a oz oe  i would proceed to get drunk and talk trash to these women things like when you sit like that you look like you are trying to mount a horse or your upper lip was stung by bees and your bottom lip looks scared anyhow i hope those ladies are doing better now i was a bit of a butthead and that is my confession
this was during my school days i was the class prefect it was the time for our physics class and our teacher was late as a standard procedure i went to the department to remind him when i entered his chamber i found out he was checking our answer scripts from the term final 

this teacher was comparatively new in our school and heavily dependent on the class leaders in many aspects i did not had a good exam hence i waited until he started examining my answer sheet i pretended this was the answer sheet of one of the most talented boys in the class manipulated him into giving at least  more marks 
so i graduated in  from a majority white area in uppermiddleclass suburbia ga everyone around here acts super high class and is tight strung and rich and stuck up im mixed and adopted so i know that im spoiled and that i have way more than i deserve i graduated with honors from high school and began attending a little womens college on a half academic half athletic scholarship i studied nursing and psychology a double major 

first semester starts and im doing great around midterms is when everything went downhill because it was the beginning of basketball season i was struggling to juggle both school and grades and i was out partying a lot more than i shouldve been though granted im in college but i was kinda sheltered at home and took advantage of the freedom i ended up tanking most of my midterms and not being able to play basketball for the rest of the semester i failed  classes and was put on academic probation by the school it doesnt go on your record or anything its just so the school can kick you out before you mess up their stats second semester goes by in a flash and im doing decently but i end up having to drop a class and take another online my grandpa died unexpectedly right before midterms and i tanked my only  i go into a depression deeper than i have in a minute and fail both my classes 

the school year ended and now im home and the other day i got an email explaining my probationary period has ended and because i failed to keep my gpa above a  ive lost my scholarship and have been put on academic suspension i appealed to it by sending an email and explaining my situation and failure to pass my classes but i wont get an answer back til the end of the month 

i hated that school anyways and want to go to a technical school to be an emt but i did enjoy my time there and will miss my friends 

my family can pay for me to go to a technical or community college so i can get my prerequisite classes done but my sister is graduating in may and is attending my college in the fall my mom thinks well be going there together 

i dont know how to tell them how ive failed i wish i could go back and tell myself hey just get up for class this one time or forced myself to study harder i know i did the best i could at the time but it still is a horrible feeling to see myself turn into this after ive done better in the past 

tldr  i failed majority of my classes and lost a ton of scholarship money by getting suspended for bad grades

 my mom thinks im going back next semester with my sister and i havent told her yet that ive disappointed her 
when i was in high school i was pretty popular you could say i was a cheerleader and blonde and an identical twin also was pretty friendly with every one in our school my sophomore year my chemistry teacher left the classroom for a bit and left our copies of our upcoming test on his desk i snuck up to his desk in front of everyone and took pictures of the test frontback everything ive always been good at school and never even really needed it i guess i was trying to be cool and i was  everyone was awing and ooohing and laughing whole thing took about a minute a couple minutes later my teacher comes back into the classroom and immediately calls me out to the hallway he asks me if i took pictures of the test while he was gone im in shock face turns bright red how could he possibly know that he was gone and he hadnt talked to anyone i straight up lied and told him no despite him asking me to tell him the truth he said okay and i went back to my desk i was so embarrassed and nothing ever happened of it to this day i have  idea how he could have possibly known that i confronted everyone in my class and never learned anything thinking he had a spy a secret camera or it was a test and i was set up almost a decade later and i still think about it 
using a throwaway for obvious reasons basically today at my job as a security guard i drew something usually at work i get bored and start doodling well today i got super bored and began drawing an nsfw comic yeah i know this was extremely dumb to be doing at work but bear with me i dont want to be too specific on where i work but basically there are points in the day where i walk around the building so i go to one of the bathrooms and continue drawing this obscene comic

im a few panels in there isnt any actual sex just a dude with a big pp talking to a girl usual nsfw scenario know what i mean then i put it on the toilet so i can pull my pants up and then i mustve forgotten it there i dont usually do this i usually pick it back up and put it in my pocket tbh im not entirely sure where i left it hopefully it was the bathroom because there are a bunch of cameras in this place so yeah i left this comic in the bathroom and like  minutes later in a place thats off camera i pull out the drawing but it isnt that drawing its a different one

so naturally i begin panicking and i go back to that bathroom but somebody is in the stall so i just pretend to use the bathroom and leave i check another bathroom where i mightve left it about an hour later and it isnt there either i was only at work for another hour after i left the paper in the bathroom and i didnt hear anything about it

this means somebody found it now depending on who this individual is they might either a say wtf and throw it away or b say wtf and hand it into security or hr depending on the decision my job could be at stake cause all they have to do is check the cameras and see who went to the bathroom before the person who found it hopefully i can lie my way out of this if im questioned but if not i get what i deserve and probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else ever again moral of the story dont draw bullshit at work and if you do keep track of it

with that said how fucked am i reddit

tldr i drew something nsfw at work and left it in the bathroomother location

update well i didnt hear anything about it today at work i went the whole day paranoid af lmao but nothing came of it so whoever found that silly comic threw it away or took it home or just didnt care thank you for all the comments everyone i think my anxiety was just making me assume the worst 
ok this is storys probably a lot more lighthearted than some of the stuff ive seen on this subreddit but im bored and this just popped back into my head so here goes

when i was like ish i was developing a habit of staying up all night and sleeping during the day during school breaks which as you may imagine my mother wasnt happy about 

being the pre teen little shit i was i argued that no harm was done since i always turned my sleep schedule back around when school started up again and i was still getting sleep just at different times looking back my mother was probably more concerned about me being a shut in who touched less grass than a camel and the eye strain from playing video games and watching youtube in the dark every day but i digress

anyway one day i guess she decided to try a more hands one approach to parenting for a change a told me shed be shutting off the internet at pm that night 

naturally i was bummed at this but as ive said what i also was was a little shit so i came up with a brilliant scheme to foil my mothers nefarious plan of getting her preteen child to have a healthy life style

basically what i did was i went on youtube and let a video play until the end not relevent but this was the video   yes it was vocaloid shocker i know so the video was fully loaded in

then pm rolled around and mom did as she said and disabled the wifi router leaving me a poor gen z child starved of its one source of entertainment but i didnt care that much actually since i was too busy smirking and metaphorically rubbing my palms together like a cartoon supervillain at my genius scheme

long story short i spent like  hours listening to that one vocaloid song on loop while sketching in my art book until finally i heard my mother wake up from the other room

the look of complete befuddlement on her face when she saw me watching a youtube video like nothing happened was pretty fun ill admit but i was determined to keep a straight face as she asked me how i was doing that

putting on my best sheepishly confused expression i shrugged and said something like i dunno you must have pressed the wrong button or something

now obviously this whole plan hinged on my mother not understanding technology to save her life and lo and behold it worked and i guess my mother must have just gave up after that one plan cause she just let me be after that

anyway moral of the story dont gaslight your parents kids and maybe go touch some grass
yes i know it is not a good idea but you have to understand how much i despise meetings

my work is very stressful and i work weird hours every day brings new problems and i am expected to be able to solve them all do not misunderstand i am also grateful that i can work but i hate and i mean hate calls and meetings social interaction drains me and i do not have a normal persons social battery i have arrived at a place of pure desperation

getting drunk seems to be the only way to deal with this maybe drunk is an exaggeration buzzed the calls are usually over zoom and the meetings always take place during the night i just feel like sharing and venting and full transparency i am kinda wasted right now anyone relate thoughts the only way i seem to be able to handle things is by getting a bit buzzed should i just accept this and go on im confused

i need this job and have to do whatever it takes to stay on top
i m started taking peds almost a year prior and i feel like dirt not in a sense of testosterone suppression but like guilt i know this might sound bad and im young and this but im very educated on the subject of bodybuilding and peds i want to bodybuild its just very intriguing ive been lifting and managing nutrition for  years and i made an irrational thought and hopped on some things i shouldnt have and its biting me in the ass my family has noticed i didnt think it was drastic bc i look in the mirror and weigh myself everyday but pictures from  months ago are crazy different and my family has obviously picked up on it not only that but they mentioned mood swings they sat me down and took me to get blood work and treatment its just been a super awkward relationship since i look and felt on top of the world but idk how to put their disappointment into words ik i fucked up but i do want to be a bodybuilder in the future i was never social and lifting and seeing mental confidence improve and physical progress got me wanting more im not sure doing this was worth the ordeal it became and i feel like shit for causing this distress 

i was never the best student and i always struggled with foreign languages and paying attention my th grade spanish teacher would write students names on popsicle sticks then draw one randomly to ask questions 

early on the school year i went to the teachers desk to sharpen my pencil saw the stick with my name on it and deposited the stick into my pocket for later discarding never again got surprised while daydreaming by the teacher randomly calling my name to answer a question 


edit thank you guys so much for your kind comments right now i am in a much better place than i was back then that attempt was the first and only one ive done and it was the most physical and mental pain ive ever experienced so i thought that if offing myself causes me that much pain then it wasnt worth attempting again sorry if that sounded stupid although im still going through some struggles i am content with my life and i have lots of things to look forward to and enjoy thanks again



ive told noone about it not my family or friends at the time my relationship with my parents was bad and we were arguing more than ever i was extremely insecure with my body and face i hated the way i looked i lost interest in things ive been doing since i was a kid everything was just overwhelming

i attempted by overdosing on painkillers at am on a school day i remember my whole body shaking as i swallowed each pill

when i woke up the next day i got ready for school as usual on the bus i got extremely nauseous and had to get off to call my mum to pick me up i threw up instantly when i was driven back home she tried to brush it off and send me to school anyway but on the way i felt like vomiting again so she drove me back home then i threw up again in the bathroom

i was bedridden for the whole day and i couldnt eat anything or else it would come back up i couldnt even walk without feeling dizzy or close to collapsing

i just said to my parents i was sick because of food poisoning from the other day i dont know if they believed me
the school i went to was considered ghetto and ugly we had a track meet and i got into it with one of the girls from the rich school i had to use the bathroom so i went to the locker room i was so surprised that none of their stuff was locked up you can call me a piece of shit i was young i was  at the time im almost  now grew up in different parts anyways i walked out with  and an ipod i gave the ipod to one of my sisters mormon friend he knew how i got it 

the next track meet everything was put in their lockers locked 
so this one day i go to my gym and while i find a locker i opened a locker that was in use and then i came across a bookbag and came across a apple watch ultra so then i take it then lock myself in the bathroom to see if it had a password then turns out that it didnt so i got happy so then i quickly factory reset it and then turns out it had a icloud lock so then i quickly turn it off and go home instantly and thought about going to a rd party tech shop and then the next day i go to the shop in a different city and then ask them if i can see a used apple watch ultra so then they handed it to me and my adrenaline was going through the roof so then since there was people blocking the way i instantly searched for cameras and there was only one camera but something was blocking it and then i instantly switched the watch i had in my pocket for the one without icloud lock and then i told him its fine i dont want it anymore so then the second guy sees it and finds a something weird on the screen and then he feels it and it was a protector and then he tells me why is there a screen protector on the watch when there wasnt one on the one i gave you and then i told him i dont know that was the one you gave me so then he turns it on and comes across a icloud lock and he tells me it has a icloud lock and then i was scared as shit and then while he was checking it i slid the new one behind my socks just incase they search my pockets and then i stay in the store and not leave so i dont act more suspicious then i was so then it got to the point where i told them and even a customer to pat my pockets so then they did and didnt find anything so i stay in the store a little but then ask if i can leave and they said im good to go  after  months i still have it only thing that i only felt and still feel is guilt and regret i plan on returning it back i need to change the way my life it before it just gets worse i know the person saved a lot of money and worked hard in order to buy that watch and my plan is to return the watch back to the store get the old one back and return it back to the gym so the owner and reclaim it enough to say im a piece of shit for doing it
i was drunk and well into my s something about the lipstick screamed color with me i dont think anyone saw me but to this day i cringe thinking about it
its been about a week and a half since but a few courses im taking at uni requires me to purchase some expensive textbooks around  i really dont have the money but need these books and i cant get them for free online either i went to a bookstore the one named after a color in the rainbow and took  books i needed and now im scared and have trouble sleeping every night 
so when i was a kid i will admit that i was a destructive little brat id do this thing in the school bathroom where id roll up a ball of toilet paper dip it into the toilet so half of it was wet then launch the waterlogged soggy lump of toilet paper at the ceiling 

every time it would stick to the ceiling and just stay there nobody ever caught me and this only went on for about a week until my yearold brain got bored of it but damn i actually feel really bad for the janitors who had to scrape them off the ceiling the first time it happened the toilet paper went unnoticed for a day or two so they had to be welldried and practically superglued to the ceiling the toilet water was unused btw feel like people might have questions about that

i hope the janitors didnt have a hard time trying to get that off the ceiling they were underpaid enough as it was
back when i was  i ended up staying with my grandparents my uncle and my cousin all in one house since they lived closer to my school that way my mom wouldnt spend money on gas there was a donut shop on the walk to school and i had no way of making money

one day i was bringing in the mail after school and had to put my uncles mail in his room while he was gone i put a single letter on his bedside table and noticed a  sticking out of the drawer i had an idea and grabbed it

the next day i walked over to that donut shop and found out they sold dayold donuts in a set of  for  i bought the box and got a fresh one for myself

i went to school and intended to give the donuts so my friends when they showed up but someone asked if they had one when i said no she offered to buy one from me that made me realize people were willing to buy donuts before school and so i agreed to sell it to her

for the next two years i walked around school every morning selling a dozen donuts every day and making a small profit without telling everyone they were day old ones after a while i ended up buying two boxes a day and selling those all before school

  
i eventually earned enough to put  back in my uncles room and he never suspected i was the one that took it i feel bad for stealing from my uncle as he passed away a few months after i slipped the money back into his room but i got a few switch games and a used gameboy advance online from the other money i had
i dont know how to start this

first of all sorry if my english is not perfect it is not my native language

i feel so ashamed and guilty about what i did

a week ago i invited my friend over i have feelings for her but was too anxious and socially ankward to tell her

during the afternoon we started cuddling each over and she asked me to massage her which i did then we started falling asleep while cuddling each over i woke up before her and i dont know what i was thinking but i started touching her breasts under her tshirt she didnt object and i thought by now she was awake so i continued to touch her i thought that because of her agreeing me to massage her she was sending me signals that she was interested in me

then i realized she was still sleeping and panicked about what i did stopped and pretended nothing happened

when she finally woke up she didnt say anything about what happened but i could sense something was off

i hesitated about telling her but i was afraid this would ruin our relationship

fastforward to today she sent me a message about wanting to talk to me about something we phoned each other and she told me she was awake knew what i have done and because she was surprised froze up during the moment

at that moment i felt the biggest shame and guilt i have ever felt ive always valued doing the right things in life sometimes preaching about it for example when talking about celebrities doing awfull things similar to what i did i feel like an hypocrite

i started immediately apologizing saying i feel so bad about what i have done saying im sorry about breaking the trust she put in me as a friend

she said that she usually like to cuddle and thought our relationship was platonic at the end she said she forgave me that i shouldnt feel bad about it never do this kind of things again and still want to be my friend despite all that

i dont deserve a friend like her and i dont deserve her forgiveness

i dont know what to think about myself this has been  years since ive had a girlfriend and fucked up so bad i feel like a creep who abused a woman during a vulnerable moment
if you look at the back of my head youll see a sizable scar running across my scalp ask my parents on how this came to be and theyll tell you my older sister pushed me in the garages and i hit my head on the concrete but that is but a ruse a lie concocted to save my  years old self from being seen as an idiot
we live in an apartment building with underground garages so the individual garages were pretty thin what that meant is that we kids would get in and out of the car while it was still outside and we would wait there while my parents ferried things in and out of the trunk we would wait there unsupervised
so one day my kid brain wondered what it would be like to fall backwards on the hard concrete floor  i stiffened my muscles and basically did a solo trustfall unsurprisingly this went poorly blood was spilt and out of all the injuries i had as a kid this was the only one to result in a scar
now my sister when she was a kid she was a pest an absolute hellspawn she used to pick on me at every opportunity she got and she felt no remorse nor a need to own up to her doing for instance one time she stole all of my fathers coin collection and even while she was forced to do chores to pay up for months she denied everything during that time
cut back to me crying and hurt on the floor my parents immediately heard me and ran out and i blamed the perfect scapegoat not once did my parents doubt my words as they knew my sister was fully capable of doing such a thing and they also knew her pleading non guilty was most likely a lie she got a pretty hefty timeout after that and i got bandages
all and all i dont really feel bad for what happened the dust has settled im probably the only one who remembers this whole debacle and most importantly my sister has grown out of her demonic phase
i was  or  years old and i had just gotten home from school when i got home from school i liked to hop on my parents samsung tablet  and play minecraft but today my mum didnt allow me to because i hadnt done my chores so as any normal response i completely lost my shit and stormed off to my room within my room i was thinking on how i could get my revenge when i needed to go to the toilet to take a fat dump on the toilet i had an idea so i covered my hand in toilet paper and put it under my ass and tried to catch my shit but it was too sloppy the first time so i had to wait til tomorrow so the next day because i was  years old i came home from school dehydrated af and sat on the toilet trying to force a shit out of me i think i sat on the toilet for an hour or so before i finally felt a turd sliding out of my asshole i cover my hand in toilet paper and caught the solid turd in it i stand up and put it on the the basin to wrap it up i then poked some holes in the wrapping and walked it down to my parents bed and hid it under some old magazines that my parents had under the bed i kid you not they didnt find it for weeks and it brought me great joy to know that my turd was stinking up there bedroom more and more everyday my parents got air freshners and everything until after like a month they decided to look if something had died in there room they look under there bed and move the old magazines to find my moldy shit my mum screamed in horror as my dad rushed over but they didnt suspect it was me they ended up thinking it was one of my uncles friends that was renovating our house at the time which my dad fired and i fealt terrible because the poor man got told that he was fired for something i did to this day i havnt told anyone the truth to this story and my parents never found out that it was i who place the shit under there bed
a month ago my dad got really high and fell asleep in our front yard when i helped him inside he just started crying saying how he felt hed fucked up my life fucked up his marriage and all that and he started promising he was going to change and hed look into detox or rehab i told him it was fine and he was fine and he that he shouldnt do rehab i said a lot of stuff that wasnt true and eventually he just said okay and went to sleep and he hasnt brought it up since 

i didnt want him to go for a lot of reasons mainly because im selfish and when my dads fucked uo he doesnt pay attention or get upset about whatever shit im up to i can get high or drunk and fuck about all day or spend all day playing video games ar any of the teenage shit that people get told off for he said a lot of times that hed get clean and hes even tried it a couple times at home and eventually he quits quitting and maybe thats for the best because as fucked up as it is i prefer when my dads high he keeps functional most of the time ands till manages to keep a roof over our head and stuff and hes happier most of the time smokes weed with me and spends time with me and i dont think a lot of dads would do that and i just dont think theres a point for him doing rehab because it wouldnt stick and hed probably be worse off and even trying is kind of worth fuck all because all the bad shit ive ruined your life stuff has already happened and he cant go back in time and keep our family together or not fuck up my childhood or any other of the shitty stuff hes done sso thers just no fucking point

obviously i know all that stuff is selfish at the end of the day but i still cant make myself stop thinking it or thinking that if i hadnt changed his mind maybe hed have gone to rehab and actually fixed himself and that wouldve been the time he sorted his life out for real but i dont know and i cant change any of that now so what the fuck am i going to do with it
when i was  i used to play rpgs with my friends religiously at that time i was deep into kpop and our rpgs mostly revolved around an imaginary universe in which we would play our favourite idols now i can see how fucked up it was but we all were young teens obsessed with wattpad fanfictions iykyk and trying to have some harmless fun 

so there was this one time when i needed to photoshop a picture of some of our idols into a strip club for the plot and searched up strip clubs on my phone which was logged into a family account my older brother was at his friends house at the time and a couple days after he came back i overheard my mum talking to him about how she saw that he and his friend searched up strip clubs she gave him a talk and a ban on his psp console and left it but i think about it from time to time and feel bad because he wasnt the guilty one and i never admitted to my mum that it was actually me
   i am a  yr old undergrad that just got my aa and i am now omw to university classes start monday and originally my mother planned for me and her to go live with my aunts house who is   hours away and has a university close to where she lives now i do love my family a lot but the problem is i just cant live with them like at all my mom and aunt used to be abusive and extremely attoment to keeping us trapped in the house all day and to not let us go out and do anything and this went on for years im actually still dealing with this shit to this day when i come home from the gym which is where i spend the majority of my free time im always getting shit now my auntie on the other hand used to be one of the people i despised the most in the world to one of the funniest and most loving person ive ever known my aunt used to back up my mom her older sister sooooo much in the past even when my mom did so much abusive shit to me but now my auntie sees me as a human being and is actually genuinely nice to me and i love being around her especially when she visits again the problem is my mom if i have to go to my aunts house my mom is gonna come with me and im afraid all that character development my aunt gained will just go right out the window and i just dont have the patience to deal with the same shit i had to deal with in the past with them i would love if i can go to my aunts house myself without my mom or since i also live with my grandma i would love to go with her as well but living with my mom is not what im trying to do so what i did was apply at a university thats a couple hours away and got accepted so i am going to set up a plan to get a dorm there  i can pay for it myself and im going to try and do sports there i just want to be away i can tolerate living with my family my auntie yes my grandma yes my uncle aunties husband yes my mom no
i know this may seem a little less harsh then some but it is something i needed off my chest

so i was on a map trip where last year if you got a good grade on a map test you could go to this trip we went to the place then to an andys which sells ice cream it was first time having andys so i definitely wanted to try something so i kept some money my mom gave me so i could get something as i got my simple vanilla ice cream since im a very simple person and i sat outside on a little bench with my ice cream one of the teachers which was my ela teacher probably made one the worse choices she probably had ever made by making me go into the bus while i barely even started eating my ice cream
i tried my genuinely best to not make a mess but ice cream is way more messy then you probably think every second it dripped on the floor i felt so uncomfortable with how i was making a tiny puddle of somewhat melted ice cream plus i dont like talking to people made it so that i said nothing about what was going on i just quickly ate my ice cream so i wouldnt make a big mess which still happened my anxiety was so high i was imaging what would happen when a teacher saw the mess as i finished my cone i casually threw it away like there wasnt a big puddle of melted ice cream on the ground took and hour to get to school an hour an hour of a puddle of melted ice cream was just sitting there moving along when the bus turned
as soon as we could get off the bus i rushed to leave because i was probably gonna have a panic attack i sat in the room i picked for rti for a couple minutes before the school announcement goes something like all students that were on the map trip come back to the bus i felt so nervous because i knew they saw the puddle
a janitor was freaking out because the mess was so bad plus apparently some other kid spilt like an entire cup of soda as well that just added to the mess my math teacher looked more mad than she could ever be she went on to say how bad the messes were and that we could not go on trips anymore because of how the kids made both the place we went to and the bus messy
then i can vividly remember a conversation going

math teacher so who did it
some kid probably th grade  did what  pure confusion 
math teacher the ice cream puddle the one that made a mess everywhere

all the kids proceed to explode in people saying that they didnt do it i didnt get anything i didnt have money left i got  insert not vanilla ice cream  and so on
i was so nervous and scared that i said nothing i looked neutral but my brain was going wild i look around nobody saw me make that mess i look at the bus people multiple people were in the bus probably checking out the mess
some kid in my class turns to me you know anything sion no i completely just lied right there i feel so bad for saying no but i did not want to hear would happen if i said yes yelling mabye me crying not today
the math teacher then goes something like who did it say it if you did it guess what my nervous self said nothing and of course since no other kid did it they said nothing as well 
i bet that every other kid was probably guessing some kid but me why not me because im a very behaved kid and sadly thats what i think the teachers thought as well i never at any point was called out by a teacher or kid we get sent back to rti and i just back to what i was doing like nothing happened
they couldnt figure out who did it because there isnt any cameras in the bus and nobody said anything so they gave up on the case
so that meant nobody knew nor wanted to guess that i did it

i feel so bad im never gonna confess but im so sorry to the people that had to clean that i would be mortified if i was an adult that had clean that

edit forgot to add some words and needed to add some small amount of context for people

 im in th grade people assumed i was young because i mentioned a kid in th grade and they would be right

 map in this case doesnt mean minor attracted person and ice cream is not code word for little boys no clue what map stands for here but its a website where kids take tests on i am not a map im 
i quit drinking for six months after coming to terms that im an alcoholic almost went to aa but i vented with some good and supportive friends one of which continues to drink too but now has diabetes so basically drinking to him is like a few beers once a month i have been lying to him more then anyone else because coincidentally i too have been drinking once a monthif you catch my drift  
at first i gave myself limits and rules and i really did try the once a month thing i failed after one month of one month drinking quickly my  drinks at most rule ended with an incalculable amount quickly my dont drink other peoples drinks ended my time limits ended and tomorrow ill be getting drunk again   


to give myself any credit once a week is better then what i used to do according to chatgpt and other research once a week is still alcoholism i dont want to admit it may need to be cold turkey part of me still thinks theres a way i can balance healthy soberity and once and a while partying idki need to say this to someone but in truthanybody i say it to will tell me to go cold turkey if they knew so thats why im venting to strangers on the internet who arent going to stop me tomorrow   

throwaway account and omitting names for obvious reasons not looking for advice just venting

update me and the owner friend talked it out and were all good 

edit  clearing this up this is moreso about the owner friend i met because of my association with the artist who scammed me the artist is long gone

last year i got scammed by an artist they disappeared after ghosting me for months and i wanted to get to the bottom of it in an act of vigilantism so i fabricated a new alias as my yo sister after this all blowed over i started talking with the owner of said community as both myself and this little sister needless to say its been over a year this person and i have grown quite close and attached to this idea of my little sister

ive heard stories of people lying about having kids and siblings to garner sympathy and this was in no way intended to do that so much as a quick cover for something that was ultimately for nothing

i know its fucked up blown out of proportion and couldve been avoided i had no idea how deep i was in until the other day and i am well aware of the shitty position ive put myself in with no easy way to go about this ill muster the courage to handle this eventually since ive recently opened up about it to two friends and they both are helping me amend this just having a night where im fuming because of my own impulse and regret
but ive hit my limit i tried to find help recently but for whatever reason all the avenues i pursued didnt work helplines not answering local aa websites being down maybe its punishment i do feel like i deserve this 

i wasted my money i wasted my life i wasted my health 

i know the drinking will kill me eventually but ive always been an impatient person 

i dont have friends to say goodbye to so ill say it to you take care of yourselves 

i hope youre loved 
i was in charge of fixtures and displays when we changed over the display tablets i had orders to destroy them i took all  nice samsung tablets home wiped the demo software and used them for myselffamily i also signed paperwork assuring that i disposed of them in the trash
i drive a small vehicle everytime when it comes to driving and people dont follow the rules it pisses me off and normally i just curse them out in my car or in my head in driving i go from  to  in  seconds  but this time i actually was in a road rage i was on the highway and this large pickup truck kept getting in front of me and getting into my lane with no blinker i almost rear ended him and this happened twice i yelled in my car he didnt hear me though but i said turn your goddamn blinkers on i got off the highway and was stopped at an intersection and he got off too he pulled up in the lane next to me i rolled down my window and yelled at him saying next time turn your goddamn blinkers on montherfucker 



i had a lemonade drink in the cup holder and threw it at his car he gave me the finger and started cursing me out and i started cursing him out after i threw the drink he literally got out his car i got saved by the bell cause the light turned green i drove off fast and he got back in his truck and came after me we drove all the way down like two traffic lights but i eventually lost him ive seen it too many times people change lanes with no blinkers or are too close to me i didnt like the lemonade drink anyways it was in the cupholder for  days
nothing ruins my day more than opening the phone to a wall of text from a friend telling me how awful their life is how no one loves them and they will die alone specifically when this is an almost daily occurence sprinkled in with selfsabotage and a lack of accountability i know i shouldnt have seen my ex but we slept together and now he dumped me again im going to kms

i am a recovering peoplepleaser and i used to go to lengths to try and help these people be their shoulder to cry on and put them in a better mood eventually my cup ran dry and i began being resentful

i started asking google gemini for advice whenever a friend starts dumping on me out of nowhere it provides really considerate responses that are much more elegant than what i would like to say after months if not years of resentment building up

the responses usually acknowledge the persons feelings empathises with them then adds a constructive question to get the person to look at the situation from a brighter side i copy paste them without guilt and hit send 

it saves me emotional and mental energy i get to learn new communication strategies and the other person feels heard
my best friends mom was younger than all the other moms and very attractive  she was a single mom  and was considered a cool mom  because she would let us hang out at her house and play loud music and turned a blind eye to smoking cigarettes and weed but her and i always had a special relationship different from the other kids we were both sisilian so that right there was a clincher she was friendly with my mom  so i could be late coming home as long as i said i was at her house if i went looking for my friend her son and he wasnt home she would always find a reason for me to come in and soendntime with her  she was lonely and i filled a void in her life and was happy to do it well fast forward im  and my birthday and her sons were two days apart so she threw us a big party it was great at the party she had a couple of drinks in her and i went inside to use the bathroom but there was someone in it well she had followed me down the hall and when i turned around she was right behind me she said fit to go pee in a soft voice with her face a half inch from mine and she gently grabbed my crotch im not bragging but im bigger than most in that departmentand she noticed so she said you can use my bathroomso i snuck around her and we put caution tape at the bottom of the stairs so nobody would go upstairs  andi went under and got in the bathroom just immediately time  between having to noee so bad and her grabbing it i was fully erect trying to pee guys you know how that goes and i see our if the corner of my eye she is standing there with her  arms crossed and this smirk on her face ill never forget   i didnt know what to do my dick was so hard i couldnt get it in my pants so i just stood there she said well we cant have you going downstairs like that now can we in a baby voice im going to have to make that 
big erection go away and dropped to her knees and to this day gave me the best blowjob ever and then we went back to the party from that day on we made time to have sex at least once a day for  over twenty five years i got married so did she i had kids she had one more not mine and then she got breast cancer and it took her really fast and to this day i look at my still best friend and he doesnt let in that he has a clue but i see her in his eyes and i get a lump in my throught  i miss her a lot
i used to use the taco bell app to order food and one day my app stopped allowing my orders to go through my phone would show that i had placed an order but when i would pull up to taco bell they couldnt see my order on their end they would check my phone to see what i had ordered and would get it for me then i would go on my app and cancel my order because it hadnt been picked up yet i did this daily for months before my life hack stopped working 

my friend got a part time job at kfc while studying at college as you can imagine his passion for the job wasnt always there and he really couldnt care if he got fired or not whenever i would go for lunch at kfc i would pay  for  hotwings  medium fries and  pieces of chicken it was amazing i couldnt even finish that much food but the fact i could get so much at that price i took advantage however it only lasted for  months as he got fired for doing exactly that 

looking back i do feel bad for stealing but in my eyes he was just really bad at his job lol 
i f always had a short fuse some things irl i would just brush off i am not too bothered in person but things like someone not understanding me or having to repeat myself is already too annoying 

while irl fine i am extremely explosive in privacy my main hobbies are art and video games and both of those things are extremely frustrating though i dont think im too bad at either 
i have been replaying bloodborne for like th time and everything well baby smoothly its my favorite game but while running throught the forbidden woods i just lost my shit and smashed my ps controller against a wall i have ps since august  and i already have like th or th controller i had ps since  and had the similar ammount  i think in the time span i think there were  broken xbox ones but one was broken because i accidentaly tossed it away while getting out of bed and got that one repaired i never met anyone who would break as many as i did and feel extremely ashamed for that especially after hearing its childish immature bullshit behaviour every time i would look up if someone has same issues 

i dont know why it escalated so much in the past year i have extremely loving and supportive boyfriend and while yes i did lash out on him many times he knows i dont mean it and i did always apologize bless him i never ever did raise my hand on him or anything like that during my outburst while controller is disposable he ts not and i would never hurt someone i love 

there might be some things i did always suffer from depression and anxiety i am pretty sure i do have adhd as well but i havent been diagnosed yet my work isnt the best either hourly quotas and minimum wage of  an hour dont make up for good motivation to get out of bed in the morning 
and while i do try to post my art its not enough to get anyones attention let alone to start with commissions or career with my limited time and resources

i dont know what to do the outbursts are just ever present sudden and with outcomes just like this not having a controller because i smash it against a wall psychologistpsychiatristisnt cheap neither are the controllers and i do want to avoid taking medication again i made that choice after few years of taking antidepresants that just fucked me up 

edit please dont tell me play different game i have repeatedly stated its not a specific game or genre that makes me angry i am able to rage to minecraft its really just depending on what i am currently playing that i release my rage onto 
today i m worked  hours at my part time job at the local hungry jacks before my older sister picked me up and drove me to gymnastics before she left to pick me up she packed my bag got me food water and clothes to change into because there isnt enough time to go home in between i was a little tired from work and took a short nap in the car which only made me feel a little more tired  when i arrived i went to the changing room and sat there for a minute on the bench i opened my phone to check the time and saw i had a massage from a friend and so i messaged him back and got distracted reading the messages of a discord server im active in after a short amount of time i became self aware of my actions and realised i still hadnt gotten changed stupidly i decided to keep reading after all i wanted a little break after work when i finally check the time again it has already been  minutes since my class was meant to start and im still in my work uniform on phone i panic a little and realise that even if i change now and go start training it will be super suspicious and people will wonder where i have been so i continue to sit and try and think about it i cant decide what to do so i just open reddit and start looking at memes to take my mind off it soon an hour has passed and im screwed for sure instead of cuttings my losses and just going out i stay in here and go over scenarios of what people will say and do i already feel quite guilty about wasting all that time and now its just getting lateri have sat here for the last  hours of my own volition doing nothing when i should be training im still sitting here panicking and writing this instead of going out but at least i have changed to make it look like i have at least done something 
this was  years ago i was m at the time one day i went to the school toilets and heard someone crying which is odd at my school as there was a lot of stigma for boys having feelings and whatnot l ignored him as i was washing my hands he got out and i saw him as he left he was one of my friends lets call him david i was so caught up in exams and everything that i wasnt very present with him as ld previously been  months later after exams he killed himself he got no support very few people new what was happening but people just ignored him we were dicks he left a note and in it said my disconnection from societyetc i just but cant think that if i said something reached out he might still be with us and i cant let myself go as i know i couldve said the right things i go to a phycologist for other reason or anything to save him
the opening scene where theyre storming the beach i was laughing at all the violence especially the part where the medics say we stopped the bleeding and the guy immediately gets shot the timing was just perfect
last week i f stayed at my friends place for a few weeks while my parents relocated to another state and i finished school my friend used to smoke heavily but quit about six months ago and doesnt want anything to do with weed anymore on the other hand i recently started smoking and have become somewhat addicted despite wanting to respect her wishes i struggled not to smoke while staying with her one night i returned from smoking and tried to mask the smell but she sensed it she confronted me and i denied it which she believed initially however my continued attempts to smoke led to suspicion and arguments feeling guilty i tried to quit but i lasted only for a week one night when she and her family were out celebrating her brothers birthday i decided to roll a little one and smoke it in the backyard i left my little bag on the table and after smoking i just decided to chill in the living room and watch some tv in my head i knew i had few hours and i just kinda enjoying the free nouse then suddenly i hear the car arriving and i realized tbey returned so unexpectedly i panicked because when hearing the car noice i started thinking about the smell and she got into the house so quickly i didnt know what to do i had a gut feeling she would smell the weed somehow and wanted so search my pockets and everything this time and i was right she was the first one to come inside and she had the look on her face as soon as she stepped inside the house she went to put her coat away and in that time i in a rush to hide my weed i inadvertently placed it in a box containing her grandmothers ashes she searched everything my bags shoes pockets and since i dont have many things theres not much to go through since she didnt find anything i knew i was on the safe side but then i had to blame it on someone else so i just said that i was out with my friends that she doesnt like cause they smoke and so on and knows they are a bad influence so anyways now i know shes watching my every move and theres always always someone in the living room so its quite impossible to get my weeds out of her grandmothers ashes because the kitchen is connected to the living room and theres always her mother working in the kitchen or father sitting on the couch after his work so there is always somebody in those rooms and my weed is still just sitting in her grandmothers ashes

there was a boy who moved to our town when he was about  who was mercilessly bullied 

he arrived in year  and was bullied non stop for god knows what reason the peak of this occurred on year  camp at the end of the year 

how it began i dont know but upon the commotion i went to his dorm on camp to see them throwing his stuff into the shower his bedding his clothes and his teddy bear the boys were blocking him from pulling his stuff out as he screamed and cried asking why i watched it from a distance and i felt cold i was   so  years ago but it sticks with me he was destroyed the next night he pissed the bed and the teachers said he ate too many pears but as an adult i know he was in a state of shock 

that boy was tortured ill never forget the screams i write this choked up im not looking for absolution but fuck i can see lots of kids post here please for the love of all that is good say something it will haunt you for decades to come 

that the teachers didnt step up i dont know 

but yeah this one sticks with me god i hope hes okay 
i m am a sophomore in college im not doing so good academically and my nerves are shot to cope i drink mainly liquor my grades were already tankeded before ill take a shot or two before heading out anywhere just to ease any anxiety i might have at first it wasnt that bad as id only day drink on weekends and during the week i only drink after my classes and homework are done but i started to drink while doing homework then eventually as soon as im done with my classes for the day im more productive when im drinking ive sought out help through counseling and i have an outlet for my woes but i feel so much pressure from my friends and family that alcohol is the only way to calm me worst case scenario for me is i fail school and i just crash on my friends couch and when im drunk that possibility doesnt seem bad at all even when im sober if seems a better alternative than living with frayed nerves  i know im still young and whatever but its really bothering me i just know without my parents and friends around id get drunk every day
i stole money from a taxi driver when i was younger about  the guy had been a taxi driver my mom had hired to pick my siblings and i from school while she was working i was in ghana then 
they guy wasnt the best taxi driver my mother got angry at him once when he drove miles away from our house to drop off another customer when he was supposed to drop us of first he even passed by our house and he ignored me and my siblings when we told him to drop us off so we can walk it was a short distance

anyway he left the taxi with us in it one day after school he went to get something and the money was there sitting out in the open it was about  ghana cedis and i remembered that he wasnt the best person so i took the money only  cedis i remember sharing it with my siblings and buying lunch at school with it

now ive moved to england and i think about it regularly as a teen and feel guilty but i honestly just want to move on as it was years ago i want to get it off my chest

anyway i just thought to share it on an anonymous app where people offer the best advice
is there anything i should do i cant pay him back i can only think about it


my carryons wheels became lodged in the space between the aircraft and the loading bridge floor when i was the final person to exit the aircraft i was so eager to get it out that i didnt even bother looking behind me instead i just yanked harder i must have pulled too hard because there was a loud crack after it was released the rear tire had struck the enormous glass door next to me as i noticed when i turned to check behind me it was severely broken yet still intact i simply kept a straight expression and collectedly caught up with my partner in order to make our subsequent trip that was not witnessed by anyone i was not pursued and this is the first time i have ever mentioned it in any capacity since it occurred in my opinion it has been sufficiently time to come clean as it was about december
i f started smoking cigarettes about  months ago i stole a pack from my dad and having been smoking periodically i havent told anyone because a i feel guilty for stealing and b its kinda nice having something i can turn to that makes me feel ok like something i get to keep to myself makes me feel mysterious lol


edit i will be chucking my pacs into the back of my dads car and hope he magically finds them because wtf
my uncle around his late thirties has had a drug issue for my entire short life of seventeen years he has had multiple hospitalizations due to it dying three times for a couple minutes
he has said that he wants to stay clean and he has genuinely made an effort to do so 
last night we had a scare that he was out using again but that was only a false alarm

two sundays ago he had three heart attacks due to the toll that his usage has taken on his body during resuscitation all of his ribs were broken he spent time in the hospital for the two weeks after and i almost cannot feel bad for others but when i saw him i felt sad for him 
he or my grandparents werent comfortable going back to the area where they lived when my uncle was going to get out drug use is quite rampant there and they are easy to get 

all three of them moved to my family and is house just for the meanwhile the first day there last tuesday i saw that they had a lot of medication on the kitchen island i saw some of my uncles it was oxycodone all i took that day was two measly pills and i felt fine about it because i thought he was gonna end up getting more anyways 

the next couple of days i would get more and more using them at least every couple of hours as of the last two days it hasnt been as enjoyable 

yesterday i stole the whole bottle because i thought he wasnt taking them at all 

the bag where i took them from was gone when i got back home but i didnt care because again i thought he wasnt taking them 

just a while ago my brother asked me to spark up with him but i was still nauseous from the oxy so i declined he went down to the basement to get a drink which is where my uncle is sleeping i sat at the stairs because he was taking a while and finally when my brother came up he asked if i had seen his pills all i could do is play dumb and lie and he believed me which i was expecting i went upstairs and i did not want to get in trouble so i got his pills collected and put them back right near his clothing pile 

i didnt think that was enough as he would blame my brother for it so i wrote him a note 

i would expect him of all people somebody to understand why i would do such a wretched thing but all i have to do is wait until the morning to see what happens 

i am able to get him more eventually at least by next sunday so i hope that can at least help him 
he didnt seem to be in horrible pain so i think tylenol at a high dosage should suffice for a little while 

i do not know what will happen but i feel indifferent to the consequences 
so i m got fired my job at a pretzel place i told everyone that the reason i got fired was because someone asked for my shift and i gave it to them then said they called me  mins before my shift saying he couldnt do it making me  mins late but the real reason i did so was because i tried to lie to my manager saying i threw up the reason she found out was because i told her the day before that i hated working on a specific day and it was the day i called out for and now everyone is saying i should go to hr about it i just feel guilty for lying
i f have always stolen things the first time was when i was about  or  and at a friends house for her birthday party when i stole her lip balm no it was not used it was a gift someone gave her since then everytime i go to someones house or to the store or anywhere i always have to take something usually its makeup that i dont even really need or something so idiotic that i have no idea why i would even take it in the first place none of my friends or family noticed my habit yet but im scared once i turn  i could be arrested for stealing in stores im trying to stop but if i leave a place without taking something ill start thinking about it and ill get a really bad feeling in my gut i want to reach out and tell somebody but im scared they will lose trust in me and think about all the things ive taken from them
almost one year ago on a cruise a girl and a man get on the same elevator as me i say girl but i really dont know how old she was the man looked like he could have been her father she was wobbly and the man she got on with was holding her arm to keep her from wandering around she looked very zoned out wasnt saying a word i got worried thought about asking her if she was okay even though i knew she wasnt she was so out of it the guy she was with looked very annoyed as if this happens a lot

i had no idea what to do it looked bad but i didnt say or do anything because there are so many cameras around no one would do that right  nobody else on the elevator seemed concerned

i feel so ashamed that i let the fear of being wrong and causing a scene stop me from potentially stopping someone from being raped please stay safe out there

edit thank you to everyone that commented it was nice to hear point of views on this im sure ill always hold shame with the memory but i will try to let go


call it childish or call it just being a baby but its finals week i take a lot more and harder classes than my roommate so his final week are a breeze and mine are hours upon hours studying my ass off lately he has these two friends that will spend all their nights here smoking playing loud music or movies and overall distracting me i have headphones and i stay in my room but o my god i have tried talking about this to him but its always just empty promises and just doesnt work im moving in a month so im not too interested in being the biggest person when i work  hours a week and take  hours of classes 

im not a bad person but im looking to end finals week strong and cant do it with them around i am the one who bought the router and i have an app that can turn off devices i have learned through trial and error which devices are theirs and i turn them off as a group we live in a farm town so this isnt common especially on hot summer nights or stormy nights for the wifi to fuck up so they try to talk but it doesnt last long and they go home even if they do i can wear my headphones and the talking is manageable 
like right out of his chair didnt seem like a bad fall but he couldve gotten seriously hurt i think he was ok tho you know how kids are aw i wouldnt have laughed if he actually got hurt i said in reply to another kid  who asked why i laughed nice kid as if i can see the future lol
          for the most part the past three months of my life have been a strange hazy unfamiliar fog 
im a full time student sophomore in college last fall my first semester of my new swankier  school was extremely hard for me i ignored my coursework ethics my previous morals and started to party run hide and use substances to forget how hard school was my addictions became and still are my main coping mechanisms it feels like my poorly developed prefrontal cortex poor choices and complete disregard of schoolwork has hurled me into a anxious spiral of skipping my work and trying to forget about it all while trying to be as happy and content as possible despite my horrible reality that first semester i failed two of my classes had never done in my life i came up with excuses for my parents and friends and said next semester will be better 
         expectedly this semester i fell into the same habits im so incredibly full of anxiety anger towards myself embarrassment and mostly guilt for my family who has helped me pay my way through school i have lied to my parents for the most part about this semester in which i have mostly ignored my schoolwork but ive told them the opposite so they wont be disappointed i hate being dishonest with my parents but it doesnt even feel like me it feels like ive been taken over by something else and i might have serious mental health issues im starting to think about taking a semester off to seriously improve my wellbeing as i fear if i keep this up much longer ill do something rash i have a therapist i trust very much and i am planning on telling them this within the next few days i am terrified to talk to my parents and face their anger even though theyve made it known i can always fall back on them 
          really i dont think school is for me right now and i need to do something about it i need to stop lying and dodging my problems but it feels like there is such a long road to that if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated thank you
when i was in elementary school i started this habit of ripping my socks apart i would pull the string that were poking out of the seam but the more i picked the more strings would come out i would keep ripping them to try and make it look like the original sock again but after a few times of doing this it started to be fun for me i dont know why but i would just keep ripping the socks and putting the string behind my dresser 

when i got into middle school my family and i moved to a new house when we were moving out of the old house my family took my dresser out the bedroom and holy shit the string was everywhere my parents were pissed my mom started connecting the dots 

no wonder why i havent seen that many pairs of your socks
thats why there was string tangling our clothes in the dryer
i wondered why halfway throughout the day you didnt have socks on

after i was busted my mom told me she wouldnt buy me socks anymore if i continued this behavior so after awhile i slowly stopped ripping my socks 

until 

when i got into high school i was so stressed out i wasnt a good student academically since i have dyslexia so the thought school just made me feel so weak one day i was in english class and i was supposed to read of chapters of our book but i didnt and we had to do questions on it i knew i would fail i put my head down at my desk and out of the corner of my eye there was a string i started pulling again this time i did it when i was stressed and by this time i was making my own money so whatever socks i ripped up i just bought another pair nothing could stop me now

i am now  years old and this habit is still in my life my family thinks ive quit ever since they busted me in elementary no yall ive kinda never stopped i cant describe it its like an addiction because whenever i have socks on all i think about is how excited ill be to rip them later 

so yea i guess thats it my strange addictions hit my line 

thats all

drunk

drank rank mank hank jank kank
im a high school senior who is already committed to a college and after i visited my out of state school two weeks ago i havent been back to school 

so two weeks ago from wednesday  friday i was at the school visit then last week on monday i skipped to catch up on the work i missed but then monday turned into tuesday etc etc and i havent been back to school im practically failing my classes like f fail the work keeps piling up because im not there but i literally cannot make eye contact with my teachers without feeling the biggest amount of shame embarrassment and sadness 

before you all come for me in the comments let me say something

i know my college can rescind their acceptance for a drop in grades i know i just need to do the work and go to school and explain and i know that there is no excuse for skipping weeks of school at a time i know all of the consequences and i know how terrible they are for me but i just cant stop and i dont know why i was prepared to go to school today i packed my backpack i got dressed i literally got all the way to five blocks before my school and i just couldnt go in i think my mom has figured it out and i know shes probably going to beat my ass

yes i am ashamed yes i am embarrassed ive been so anxious about this for the past week

edit first thank you everybody for your responses ive read all of them so far a lot of people have pointed out that this might be a mental health crisis which i am looking into and im trying to find a therapist soon some people have dmed me so thank you and i would love to talk to more people about this if they also want to request a chat w me

second i want to clear some things up since my explanation didnt seem to be as clear as i thought i will graduate high school with terrible senior year grades but i will graduate my school works off of a quarter system so although this quarters grades are failing i will most likely graduate with a c or higher in my classes my grades prior to this are all as with the exception of two bs  one in sophomore year pre calc and on in junior year physics also i have always desired to go into higher education maybe academia and ive worked hard to achieve that goal i love education and learning for the sake of education and learning

thats it for now thank you all

edit update like many of you said my mom found out super fun not awkward at all conversation anyways i also went back to school today i went straight to my counselor and explained that i have been having a hard time we rescheduled my ap tests to the make up days and asked my teachers for leniency while grading my late work thank you all again i finally faced my problem and im better off for it i will have to work all of may while my friends are enjoying their last month but thats what i get
sorry for any language mistakes english is not my first language  
i think this might be something important but im not sure im a teenager so i have been drawing digitally since  and in i think  i got into vtubing i got so into it that i decided to learn how to draw and rig badly vtuber models because i wanted to become one and take commissions but it was not working out then i found out about groups and companies and i wanted to make some art and vtuber friends so i decided to create a group i got  members in they were all very friendy and nice people and now one of them is my boyfriend but i wanted to make it bigger so i changed the whole theme of the group i had a really bad  and was really depressed and art burnt out i dedided to look for some inso on banner designs from other small groups i already had a logo designed i found one that i liked so much that i decided to replicate it right after i finished it i posted a new applications opened post on twitter and unfortanetley the people from that other group found that one of them decided to quote retweet it saying that i stole the design it didnt hurt me the most tho i did change the design and apologized without adressing that it was exactly me who did this but an artist from the group what seriously hurt me was the fact that people started making fun of the fact that my bf coowner at the time was a minor and that it was ran by minors it was clearly stated on the groups website that were just a group not a company i have also found out that i have terrible timing because that group ended because everyone left cuz of the toxic menagement or something i later on got a dm from the person who qrt the post and said that if i said who did that they would delete the post i did confess to them that it was infact me and that i felt really bad for what i did and that i have learnt from what i did they did not delete the post which i guess is understandable i ended my group a week after because the stress and my depressive episode was too much for me  
im doing much better now but i have a wayy to good memory to forget that which kinda sucks im kinda worried that it might affect my future as an aspiring artist though

ps i have stopped being a vtuber too might just be the guilt or smth i sorta guilt tripped myself into leaving vtubing
when i was about  and my brother was  we were playing a game that was

 throw yourself on the mattress on the floor from the bed  cm from the floor

for whatever stupid reason i decided to pull a prank on him and removed the mattress after his jump but instead of him jumping in a more safe position like we were doing he decided to go headfirst even then i shouldnt have done this i instantly regretted and couldnt put back the mattress on time and he hit his head on the ground it probably hurt a lot and until now this sometimes haunts me
i found someones debit card in an atm i didnt tell anyone and no one at the gas station noticed i used it to order myself  worth of clothes i feel really guilty what should i do
ive been tutoring for the sat and act tests at a local center for  years during that time ive been able to support myself and save money even though i only work something hours a week but something thats always on my mind is that its a waste of money there are tons of free online resources i honestly think theres something wrong with your brain if youre paying thousands of dollars instead of telling your kids to go watch some math videos on youtube

not to be racist but the director and other employees have pointed out that most  of the students are asian ive been told they sign up because tutoringeducation are part of their culture and to them its the right thing to do for their kids

in my opinion if they took the money theyre spending on tutoring and invested it instead it would give their family a much better return

most of the kids dont improve their scores im serious its rare i dont know what the parents say i never have to talk them thats the directors job but somehow he gets more signups and we stay in business

the sat doesnt even matter much i dont care about the test and never have some tutors have a bunch of testtaking strategies but i havent given them an ounce of thought somehow ive gotten away with not even knowing how many questions are on the test or how long it takes all i do is show them how to do math problems and walk them through texts im a great testtaker but an awful tutor

i hate having this as my job but it pretty much fell into my lap i have no other skills and i dont know how to find another job any other job i could feasibly get would pay substantially less

please ignore any punctuation errors im sick of it
many years ago when my children were young and mobile phones werent common place one of my kids friends was having a birthday party 

now the kids were all around  and the birthday boys grandmother was organising the party since she was quite involved in his life and we all knew her well she had a very distinct voice 

i was a busy mum of  kids of my own around this time and the old land line phone rang as i was cooking dinner and i knew it was her as soon as she spoke the trouble was she thought she rang someone else another mum called mary and i didnt catch on straight away that she thought she was speaking to other mum so i sheepishly went along with it trying to get her off the phone 
it was too late to tell her i wasnt the person she thought i was as i had already started to answer questions about this other ladies family i dont know why i didnt say something to her i think i was a bit distracted with cooking and wrangling the kids and embarrassed by that stage 

she chatted for a few minutes about the party and invited this family to attend and gave all the details even checking about one of the kids allergies for all she thought she had invited this family and checked them off her list 

once i got her off the phone i breathed a sign of relief until the phone rang again it was her she was now ringing me to invite my kids 
i answered the phone in a slightly different voice than what she had just spoken to and went through the same motions yes wed love to come see you there 

when the day of the party comes around we attended and she was asking where mary was since she hadnt shown up she thought mary had sounded a bit strange on the phone when she rang her to invite her but couldnt understand why she hadnt turned up with her kids 

i said nothing and i felt terribly guilty that the kids had missed the party and now the grandmother thinks mary didnt turn up 

i never told anyone what happened and i still dont understand why i didnt correct her earlier on the phone  and i let it go on 
 years have past now and i hope she and mary reconciled 


my father cheated on my mother with this girl who was his colleague as soon as my mother left she moved into our family home 
this woman had no love for me and my sister or for her own daughter
she hardly spoke to us she insulted us she went through our things and stole from us
in her eyes we were nothing subhuman beings
she made us eat expired things while she went to restaurants or to friends houses with my dad she made us buy our shower gels our shampoos our toothpaste we had to ask her for toilet paper even our menstrual products when my father went away she starved us
she and my father would make long lists of household chores for us and tell us that homework came later or that we had to get up earlier before going to school to clean up
every evening we had to prepare their breakfast for the next morning even have the dose of coffee beans already in the cup and every morning we got up earlier than them so that our tasks were completed so every morning for more than ten years after pouring hot water into the cup i spit in it and she never knew

joking aside she was a nurse
turns out my dad cheated on her with another colleague and now they are divorced
i love hearing drama but that also means that i inevitably get involved and then i end up feeling guilty because sometime i just need to vent why one person in the group is annoying me to the others because its validating but i recently did this and didnt realize my two other friends really didnt like one of the girls in the group to the point where she didnt want to be friends anymore like yeah she can be annoying but so can you guys and so can i so now i feel bad and have to confess to make myself feel better
okay so ive been lying to my friend group for an entire year and i have no clue why
basically we were once talking abt airsoft and instead of saying i like airsoft i said i play airsoft and now  months later this is still going on
they ask me about it every monday because i say i play it every sunday
i dont know how they havent caught on i havent even given the airsoft ranges name because its not real and completely made up
its like a core part of all my friendships now
revealing the truth would genuinely ruin he entire friend group 
my friends get so invested in my made up stories about how i won a tournament
this lie just gets bigger and bigger aswell for some reason i said i have a tournament in norway at the end of summer
i have no clue wether to end the lie or continue it until either the truth comes out or i leave the friend group next year
ive felt guilty about this for ages but also some part of me finds it really entertaining to see how much i can get away with
i also feel like a bad person for lying about it
this will either end very well or up in flames and only time can tell
i found a postcard with the diceman on it in a gift shop and felt like pranking my brother and he freaked out and i couldnt go through with disappointing him so ive carried this with me for  years 

as the title states i found a small snake in a sticky large bug trap i cut the trap up to make it easier to get off of the snake i tried taking the snake off of the trap slowly but it was taking scales with it and leaving such an amount of sticky residue behind that i couldnt imagine how this guy would survive 

i spent awhile trying to come up with solutions to save it but i resorted to a mercy killing exotic animal rescues were closed and i couldnt stand the thought of just leaving the thing on the trap until they opened  hours later i cant stop thinking about it i cried when i did it ive cried since 

i held the thing in my hands for quite awhile while trying to save it it was living and breathing in my hands the worst part is i tried to make it quick with scissors it was relatively quick but just slowmotion in the moment 

i just cant feel right about it i feel sooooo awful 

edit to update you guys have been so truly kind im really not fully in a place to feel better about it yet but im really so thankful for your uplifting encouraging and informational comments thank you so much 
i am ready for whatever shame or anything that comes my way i really need to hear it as a wake up call wrote this last night sorry for the grammars i did write this fast

growing up in a strict asian household as the eldest childf ive carried immense pressure from my immigrant parents to cope ive resorted to a web of lies culminating in a monumental deceit pretending to attend college for nearly three years
this all started back in  i went a community college so still living at home but due to covid classes had to be online well i lack motivation and my mental health even now was terrible led me to fail the entire semester i should have just withdrawn from all my  classes i was taking but i thought i could fix my mistakes anyways i obviously didnt tell my parents till the end of the semester that i failed i basically had to confess during new years eve bc my mom caught on that something was up my parents have both advocated for school and think its the only way to a sucessful life
we had a major argument that almost lead my almost dad throwing and hitting something at me during those times i opened up about my mental health such as depression and well that wasnt fun as my dad doesnt believe in that stuff and while my mom is a little more sympathetic she still skeptical thats besides the point basically i got a job and my parents told me that i only had month to take i guess what was a semester break it got me in another agrument bc i felt a month was tooo short of a break for me and that i needed at least a year to really get myself together i lost that argument and went back to school i did  really fast paced online classesi actually did pretty good in those  classes managed to get my gpa slightly up the next stem i did pretty deccent it wasnt until spring  were the grades came crashing
i learned something abt myself during those times and its anytime i tend to to rlly well in something i stop trying bc i think everything will workout i told my parents what happened and that i wanted to drop out they gave me an ultimatum either i find some job and then move out or stay in school this is were i fucked up i wish i took the job offer instead of sticking with school i mean i told them id rather work but idk the guilt i had choose that path ate me up they looked so disappointed especially my dad bc his dream is for me to get an education it really had me questioning if im doing this just to please them which i was bc i chose to go back to school now this were the lies begin i basically flunked out of college so i couldnt take any classes for  whole semesters also this whole time im going to school for free my school is getting paid for

so what did i do i would pretend to leave for school then i deepen the lie by saying i was able to transfer schools and now my supposed graduation is coming up this week

okay well the first half of the year back in fall  i literally did nothing i would just sit in the car or at my campus library and watch youtube all day anyways i ended up getting a new job wasnt so bad but i left the job fast forward to januarymarch  i sent in my appeal letter to my school and got accepted back to like  classes over the summer did okay i did withdraw from one i believe but wanted to move school start fresh so i started looking up online schools or just any school weather it was a tradevocational beauty and just any sort of program to help at least have something i told myself once i got that sorted out id tell them i didnt get things sorted out i still am i started doing some self learning i have a passion for film and graphic design so been studying on that learning stuff on digital marketing through youtube bc why not maybe get into content creation be a ugc creator idk ive been studying for the clep exam incase i do want to back to college i can just take test to get out of retaking all my failed classes started door dash just a month ago while it isnt some crazy money at least im making something also go to the gym and been working on my health most of the time though its just me doing research and not getting into action mostly because im scared to take risk i cant even say the small things about myself to my parents i dont even think they truly know me for example i have an interest in fashion ive seen these girls online start business where they help style people they buy items and pieces that match the clients style and aesthetic that sounds like so much fun and something id love to try another thing is psychology and even sex psychology idk ive heard some people say id make a good sex therapist with the advice  i give and how open i am about it all plus ive always been fascinated by these industry not that id ever join just so curious as to why one would choice that life and how as a society we indulge in it anyways hopefully i can share that with them when i confess bc i might confess a lot more than this 

either due to the depression and anxiety i got which i really should see a therapist for i desperately need one also considering i might have adhd due to the lack of focus and commitment i have

while not being in college or having an actual stable job did make me slighty happy as i didnt have to worry abt an assignment due or a shift to go to this yrs of self reflect made me understand how privilege i am i got to go to school for free and ive just been leeching off my parents for everything people would probably kill to be in my shoes i feel like ive been ungrateful and selfish for the lies ive told youd think after the first  incidents i would learn my lesson but clearly not i havent only hurt my parents but my younger sister as well the amount of pressure she must be in to succeed bc i ended up becoming the failure i mean shes told me this recently so i know i feel like a shitty terrible person like ive committed a crime i know me feeling bad doesnt make me a shitty person but i just feel like i dont deserve this privilege life ive been given my parents wokred hard for this and for me to just tear it all down like the only reason i ended up here is bc i failed a shit ton of classes in college and im not stupid its just im so lazy that it rlly hit me hard i need some motivation like some good motivation i have days were i feel strong and determined and most lazy tired and undetermined 

 now at a crossroads i grapple with conflicting desires to please my parents with academic success or to forge my own path towards personal fulfillment its like what do i choose to do im already  i dont have like a set in stone goals like i want to do everything and nothing at the same time i want to turn my life around i dont want to live with my parents forever but the future scares me i honestly didnt think id be alive right now not that ive ever kms but i have thought abt it even now ive thought abt that or running away instead of facing the truth 
 
tomorrow well today since i just posted it i must confront them with my truth armed with a somewhar tentative plan for the future acknowledging the need to grow up and shoulder responsibility even if it means severing financial ties ive read similar stories to mine on here some got good high paying jobs and some even kept the lie going got fake degrees and everything wish some gave updates my reaction is wow its nice to know im not alone in this situation others have been there it feels good to get this off my chest because ive been keeping this to myself for yrs only one other person knows which i told them recently incase i get kicked out i know this is all fault and i really have no excuses i cant keep lying as much as i want to i cant i know they will definitely get angry but i know its out of love and care hopefully im ready to turn my life around even if its challenging sorry making this so long

btw forgot to mention what i was majoring in education hahaha ironic i wanted to be a teacher i guess its weird i still do but dont

edit if anyone has any advice on how i should better my life or if i should stick to college if anyone knows any resources or recommendations to programs or anything similar id really appreciate it 

updateish well im gonna tell them when they come home from church or when i do bc i volunteer at the sunday school so i have to go to church while im not super religious maybe if i pray to god or jesus both can give some guidance or a miracle who knows maybe my parents know this whole time and are letting me keep up the lie till i confess ive had my suspicions anyways regardless it will be painful especially after church my mom wants to throw me a graduation party and im sure right now shes telling people about it i wish i had just said something as soon as she brought that up yesterday the more i delay the more mess it will cause ive already delayed for almost yrs i think i got so caught up in my lie it just never really hit me  that i had to tell them the truth id leave every morning around a certain time and then id just do whatever forgetting this major situation hell i almost was considering buying a fake degree and saying i actually dont want to go to my graduation anymore also i mentioned in the comments about needing school receipts i was gonna make fake ones that would be crime this is how mentally fucked up ive become 
i dont deserve my familys forgiveness i did so much hurt to them
my fianc at the time  m and i  f were trying for a baby a few years into our relationship we were going through a rough patch and i thought that if we had a baby like he wanted his behavior would change biggest mistake of my life 

i was immediately regretful i couldnt believe i had gone as far as faking positive pregnancy results  i made the decision quickly that i could never let anyone know about this  and i started making a long term plan to make things look and seem like they justdidnt work out for us i promised i would take this secret to the grave with me but it has been eating me alive every day since then 

its terrible what i did was terrible in ways that i cannot describe its just so fucked up and i dont even understand why i did it i dont understand why in that moment thats what i decided to do 

i know and fully acknowledge that i am much more than a huge piece of shit for putting someone through that and i cant even honestly begin to describe how bad i feel for doing these things and i should to be honest 

edit ive already talked with my therapist about this and we talked about the choices i had and agreed that the best decision is to tell him when he has a second to understand the weight of things ive already talked with who i need to talk to to understand why i did these things  and am seeking out the professionals i need a lot of people here are only looking at things from one side  but need to realize that i hurt a lot of people in this process whether it was badly or not i had expecting parents giddy for a new grandchild friends who were so excited for me and started giving me advice right away i very much should feel bad about this but all i can do is take the right steps now to repair things the best i can  there really isnt anything anyone can say to convince me to not tell him about this for the sake of both of us i needed to let go of the guilt ive been carrying around for years and thats all this post was admitting what i did 

second edit sorry this ended up being so long i expected things to be a little busy but definitely not to blow up so quickly after reading a lot of the comments and thinking about what the majority of what im seeing i understand things from a different perspective now i understand that bringing things up now would give him something more to grieve about when hes probably already moved past things i will continue to just talk to my therapist about how to move past it without having to tell him 

 some questions answered
 i am no longer with this guy and we dont reach out to each other at all anymore 

 my therapist did not convince me to tell him anything i explained how i felt about things and at the time i thought that he would want to know so my therapist talked me through the risks and consequences  and how i should approach things if i went through route i wanted to take  which is obviously out the window now so no worries there

 this is not a shitpost my orientationusername honestly has nothing to do with this at all and all you need to know is that i do have the ability to conceive children if i didnt i wouldnt be in this situation 


i dont know how bad it is because the car i hit is white but i think it seemed fine my car doesnt really have scratches but i dont know about the one i hit these girls saw it and told me i was good and i barely hit it i dont know though has this happened to anybody before and should i do anything
i f became a vegetarian in secondary school and was one for about  years when i got to university i started dating a chinese guy we loved cooking together  it was a huge part of our relationship  and he would tell me how he wished he could share more food from his culture with me but it was difficult because my diet meant i couldnt try most of it after a few months i decided to start eating meat again for that reason as well as others missing mcdonalds for starters

xb

my sister f is a vegan and she hasnt eaten meat since she was  mostly on principle shes a great person but shes principled almost to a fault about these things and i didnt tell her at the time because i knew id never live it down well its been almost two years now and i still havent told her the past two christmases my family had to save turkey for me for after dinner so that she didnt see me eating it 

xb

everyone knows accept her and on one hand its not that big of a deal to keep up the lie since we dont live together and telling her is probably more trouble than keeping it up on the other hand shell find out eventually either from me or the family and at the end of the day its not really her business what i eat regardless 

xb

this whole thing is obviously silly but it still feels impossible to tell her i thought maybe id blame it on the doctor telling me i needed to eat meat for health reasons or something but maybe i should just bite the bullet i dont know but i can honestly see myself keeping this up for years 
i f have been at university for my first year and needless to say i hate it ive struggled with my mental health and i hate going to classes i lie to my parents and family pretending that i have good grades which i dont i pretend living on my own is fine its not and im starting to break its starting to affect my physical health too everything is just too overwhelming and i cant help but cry im contractually obligated to be at the university due to the scholarship i went with but i just genuinely hate it i came for art education but realized all my art classes have done was made me hate my artwork something i spent years teaching myself to do i also recently realized my sister my precious little sister who ive done my best to be a good role mode and friend to hates me to say it broke me is barely scratching the surface it also broke me to realize the abuse i experienced at her hands wasnt normal i am physically much weaker than her even from a young age and am not confrontational and just the other day i found out my old boss a lady i considered to be like a second grandmother died i want to cry scream and sleep i dont know how much longer i can keep up this mask and its haunting me i hate lying to my mother but i know itll break her heart to realize that im not okay i dont even know what to do
imf and just got into uni  already im having a bad time and i feel very shitty about it  i was photographed in my room while taking care of my pubic area and i have no idea who did this but ive heard this guy talk about uploading something with his friends while hysterically laughing and i think its him  ive been isolating myself ever since then cause after that i got stares and whispers  i dont know where he uploaded this cause i reckon i wouldve seen it by now so im worried  i get triggered everytime i hear laughter and have been sobbing none stop  at this point i dont want to be in this uni anymore and ive been giving my mother hints that i want to switch unis but she thinks i should stay  i dont blame her cause she doesnt know whats going on  but i really want to get out of this place  ive missed classes every now and then cause i panick everytime im outside my dorm  and with every chattering i feel like im the discussion i dont know what to do and this is weighing heavily on my mental health should i report this and get the dude in trouble  or should i just bear it through  i feel so bad for lying to my mother  

edit  i opened up to my my cousin today and we had a long talk about it  and i plan on reporting the matter to the school now  even though i have not told my mother yet  you guys were right about telling at least one person so i dont suffer alone i feel a little better now and im no longer suffocating as much   thanks guys

when i was a kid i was baking with my grandma and i thought it would be funny to put yeast in the sugar water to ferment the water into alcohol for the birds
my first job was as a cashier at tractor supply in the adjoining parking lot there was a tasty freeze i was paid minimum wage and all the managers were assholes so one day i decided when they were busy to process a fake refund for a small item around three dollars just enough for a small ice cream cone with sprinkles 

once i realized there wasnt any security cameras at tsc i felt very comfortable doing this for about an  month period i never got caught i eventually moved on to a better job where i get paid more and the managers arent assholes i have never stolen from my current employer except for time wasted scrolling reddit on my phone like im doing rn 
i have a medical condition that affects my stomach in middle school i used this to my advantage and if i was forced to go to school on a day i didnt want to be there i would go to the nurse after a certain amount of class periods and i would claim that my stomach hurt due to my condition it was easier for them to let me go home instead of staying in class so i was able to skip school and many classes because i lied to them i know my parents knew that i was doing this but because of the condition and because i was a kid they let it slide
my friend had bought some snacks from the school store which she paid for and whenever we left from the area  we went into the auditorium and when she went into her cashapp and saw like the payment i told her to cancel it as a joke but kept like egging her on to cancel it and she did  she got in trouble  iss for  days  and i felt the guilt which i should because i got her in trouble  i kept apologizing to her saying that im sorry that i will talk to the counselor about it to reduce your days in iss we talked and laughed about it but it was my fault that she got in iss which i take full accountability and responsibility 
so theres this one stop sign i gotta turn right at to drive onto my street and this car always parks right at the stop sign like at the fucking corner and its annoying af like the bastard gives me no room to turn and i had enough so i snuck out and keyed it i wasnt satisfied and i plan to go out again and smash one of the windows possibly light it on fire well see
i teen f have been dating my boyfriend for a few weeks now and i couldnt be happier lets call him aaron for privacy purposes the only problem is i i have homophobic parents aaron is a ftm trans person and i love him l with all my heart but my religious parents believe lgbtq is not okay they say they arent homophobic but always remind me that its adam and eve not adam and steve i began to secretly date him a few weeks ago but i feel to guilty that im keeping this secret i cant even trust my brother i really wonder what i can do in this situation i dont know if they will accept me or tell me im confused or just plain wrong my mother has already told me that aaron is just confused and she is just a girl i dont know what to do but i dont plan on telling them anytime soon what should i do 
when i was  i was in a department store elevator by myself i didnt think anyone could hear me for some reason and started screaming as loud as i could 

when the elevator door opened there were two employees that escorted from the store and i was told never to come back 
in th grade there was a new girl in my class i was always looking over at her at lunch she tapped me on the shoulder and she said hey you everytime when im around you why do you always stare at me i just made up a reason me staring at her was only sometimes i did it and then me staring at her turned into an everyday thing everytime i walked past her in the hallway or when i saw her i would look at her she would always say to stop stop looking at her one time when we were passing by each other in the hallway i was looking at her again and she said to me boo little boy she elbowed me to the wall in th grade she was in my pe class and again i was doing it she told me i act just like her little cousin she also road my bus she sat in the back and i sat in the front everytime it was her stop id turn around to watch her go past

she said to me once boo dang always be staring at me i glaced at the bus driver and i saw her laughing someone sitting across from me asked why do you keep on staring at her i said i dont know in th grade she wasnt in any of my classes she was just in the hallway and again i stared at her everyday in th grade she wasnt at the school anymore
when i was in primary school from around yrearly yr i was extremely rude towards this girl i was classmates withi will call her h she was that student the entire class was condescending to im not sure if this is a common thing but it at least was in that school i was no better and also treated h badly one thing people would emphasise about her is how much she cried but i think agoing through that at a young age gives you all the more reason to be so sensitive and b were all like  we all cried  a lot why was she overdramatic after year  our school decided to do a shuffle up to that point we were all classmates since foundation stagewhich is sort of like kindergarten i guess its just before yr by the start of yr me and h werent classmates anymore except for  classes i remember vividly at the beginning of year  while we were waiting outside for one of the classes i joked about how much she cries and when she got mad rightfully so i tried to play it off as a joke to avoid punishment but i really wish she didnt listen to me so i could finally understand the consequences of my actions then and there

after that i dont really remember seeing her if im assuming correctly she left the school i also left that school for context im at my third school rn the situation im about to describe was in the secondill call it school  and in school  a similar situation played out there was a girl a majority of the class disliked and belittled in the end the problem was fixed but it had me start thinking about h that was a year ago and i keep thinking about her more and more im  now and i am grateful im able to discern wrong from right now but that still wont change what i did so i hope to give her an apology even though its long overdue while i know simple words wont do a great change i think this is only the bare minimum i could do i hope i can get into contact to her so i can at least show her im sorry
am i bad person
so when i was  me and my two other  brothers was playing baseball outside i had tried to throw him  the ball but i missed and it  had broke the glass window we tried to hide the broken window and lied about it  but we forgot there was security cameras so we all had got whooping for lying
once when i was around  or  i went to a bustling area in town armed with a bunch of raw eggs i hurled them at a car in a nearby car park for a bit of mischief and then quickly made my getaway before security showed up

when i was  i really wanted to make movieso i took a video of my parents havingwell  you knowthey  just found it recently also please excuse my english isnt the best
when i was maybe  years old i had a bad habit of taking money from my parents whenever i had a chance i think i had this obsession with cash i had nothing to spend it on i had a happy childhood  

i would keep it in a book bag in my closet which is also where i kept any money that was actually mine like from birthdays and chores i dont know why but one day my parents came across the book bag 

perhaps they just instinctively knew a  year old has no business having so much money maybe  or so or they put  and  together remembering all the money that had gone missing lately either way they assumed all of it had been stolen and they took it all back 

at least  or so was honestly my money but i lost it all because i was a thief needless to say my fingers lost all their stickiness after that 
i  m came from a middle class and strict house  where cellphone was allowed only when you are entering collegeso i didnt have a cellphone until recently during my  my time in highschool all of my friends had an cellphone so  there also an eager within me to get a cellphone but i knew my parents wouldnt buy me a cellphone so i came up with an crazy plan to steal money from my parents suitcase where they were saving money to build us a new house to stay long story short i stole approximately  rupees which is  us dollar i got myself a cellphonebut eventually i was busted and had to lie to my parents about the cellphone i told them i stole the cellphone from the shop itself and didnt told them i had stolen money from their suitcase till this day they dont know about the money i have stolen
in my defence i genuinely usually am a decently  pleasant person to be around im pretty chill with most things and make an effort to avoid confrontation 
im kind to everyone as a default but i do feel dislike towards a few people based on experience

i hate to admit it but on occasion that someone has really rubbed me the wrong way for whatever reason ill  take advantage of the fact that everyone sees me as the girl that is never involved in an argument and can do no wrong 

its a rare occurrence but when i have been catty with someone i will do so quietly and rely on them causing a big show of how rude i wasat which point ill just blink obliviously and let them blither as no one believes them

its a tactic i use sparingly and only with good reason but i am fully aware that i have created a few instances of social downfall for a couple of popular stereotypical mean girls etc over the years its absolutely terribly manipulative of me but honestly i have never regretted it

i do feel bad that so many people are convinced im a completely innocent and lovely person who would never say anything mean ever to anyone but i also know that the few times i  have it has been completely morally justified oops

when i was in th grade i had a best friend  she and i were literally inseparable one day thinking stupid thoughts we decided to steal the sticker book of a fellow classmate because hers was bigger and better with more stickers and better stickers than ours i was the look out she stole the book i took  stickers she took the book home the next day all hell broke loose in the classroom the girl was so extremely much more upset than i expected and i felt so bad my bf felt bad too the girl was affluent and i couldnt understand but maybe it meant as much to her as my barbie collection meant to me i told my bf we need to sneak the book back in her desk but she had done a number on it by taking  and ripping stickers off  it looked horrible i put the  i took back in as near as i could  so now shes the look out and im trying to get this big sticker book that was more like a large photo album back in her desk and my bf took off and i didnt know and got caught i took the entire blame i dont know why a lot of classmates exiled me and shunned me because of it i was labeled a thief not a soul defended me my bf ended up not even talking to me i never told it was her that took it i knew about it which made me a part of it too she destroyed it when i had to come all summer long to summer school and earn money to pay this girl what it was worth and i didnt destroy it but i did keep my mouth shut  a few years later in junior high i had broken up with my boyfriend and this stickerbook girl started dating him and she spoke with me that one time in all the years following this incident the remainder of the years we went to school together  small towns dont forget never did anything near like that again  ever but i never did speak up about who else was involved 
all my life i have hated those typically middle aged ladies who talk too much and say horrifically insulting things to others innocently i am in my s and i am realizing that i am that person unfortunately i can assure you that i am on the inside a very loving person i hate passive aggressiveness and appreciate frankness i am genuinely happy to meet most people i do and the ones i dont like i just avoid i dont backbite or gossip i give people sincere advice when they ask for it and many friends have told me i give them a comfortable older sister vibe so they feel comfortable asking me for advice maybe its that i dont think through what im about to say and choose to speak impulsively rather than thoughtfully but over the past few years its become more and more apparent to me that i am unintentionally kind of a b this isnt really a confession its a realization and it makes me really sad 

i try to give in charity volunteer my time offer a smile and kind words to neighbours always bring my best self for family and friends mind my own business focus on self improvement but mistakenly end up saying things that could be seen as passive aggressive insults i dont really know how to be kinder i dont know how to be more thoughtful when im speaking sure starting out in a conversation i can be mindful but once that flow starts going im just flowing with the conversation without thinking about what im saying i struggle with valuing myself as it is and carry a lot of guilt in general i dont know how to get past this i kind of hate myself for being this way 

examples of statements ive made completely innocently that were offensive to others

 met an indigenous girl i was fascinated by her culture and asked her permission to learn more about her culture from her she was cool with it so i started asking more about their lifestyle hunting the foods they eat etc in the context of this i asked her if igloos were a real thing she responded normally but later posted about me completely tearing me apart for daring to ask her something like that about igloos specifically 

 saw a friend being bombarded with verbal conversations on different topics with  different people at the same time and keeping up with them successfully i popped in to ask him if he had adhd because i found it amazing that he was able to do that in my mind i saw it as a very valuable skill that he was able to keep up with so many conversations and i thought it might be because he is able to maintain different streams of conversation  said as a compliment if youre able to follow my train of thought 

there have been so many of these kinds of instances in my life it really sucks to be that person i dont want to be seen as the person who is always hurting others with random hurtful statements any advice 
so bacily i was at dollar general and i think what happened was we were at the checkout line and he my uncle says oh we need toilet paper so i run to the toilet paper isle and just grab one  and run back and as im running back i realized i got the thin toilet paper and my mom and me hate the thin toilet paper so when  i walked past this basket with stuff in it which i thought  was like an abandon cart yk when someone leaves there cart because they dont want it no more anyways i replaced the thin toilet paper with the on in the persons basket oops  soo yeah i took someones toilet paper from  their doordash order also we payed for it i just meant the person that ordered the basket of stuff was prob like hey wheres my toilet paper ll
so i am in my first year of college and before joining i was determined to actually make friends and be part of a friend group considering i was alone most times during high school 
the thing is i am indian like pure indian except that i was brought up in another country currently i have so many friends and life is good problem is they dont know the real me on the first day of orientation some of the international students from our friend group were discussing about how much they detested indians because of their lack of hygiene which is portrayed in instagram reels as an indian i can guarantee myself that foreigners are the ones that film only the bad parts of the cities post in social media and claim that this is what the whole of india looks like we do have hygiene maintained and most of our cities are pretty clean too we are not surrounded by smelly sewers dirt water or drains or else  billion people wouldnt have been living there 
anyways i decided to introduce myself with a different name and say that i am from indianasounds pretty to close to the word india and i also told them how i hate indians and i hate eating traditional indian dishes but loved korean and chinese cuisines like they doso not true i honestly felt a strong guilt but i really want to fit in for once its already been  months in college and all my friends are so amazing do you think i should tell them the truth or just wait for the next  years and  months 


edit its not just the international students in my friend group hate indiansliterally every single international student that i know hate indians also i am from the north side jammu so like i dont have the typical brown skin more of the fair side so maybe because of that they believed that i am from indiana help a girl out thanks
some girl was walking either from or to the dance floor and i was walking adjacent to it and we collided and she dropped her drink i didnt do anything about it and walked away i dont know if she was drunk its safe to say she was considering the place we were at and i was definitely drunk she didnt confront me for some reason and i walked away 

i feel terrible about it and wish i had offered her a new drink
when i was  in preschool i showed up to class as usual and a kid has a crowd around him i go to see and a crusty beetle was in the styrofoam cup he was holding i was disgusted but whatever later i find out that he left for a couple hours for swim practice and left the beetle in the cup on a picnic table it was the perfect opportunity to unalive it so i sneak up to the table and make sure nobodys watching i open the cup and low and behold the beetles inside i release the beetle and try crushing it with the cup a few times it obviously didnt work so i was sitting there wondering what to do i let the beetle crawl away for a second before i get the bright idea to just let it go free i put the cup back where it was and run off unnoticed when he gets back he starts yelling wheres my beetle where is it and i cant hold it in anymore i run away giggling and a crowd starts forming around him till this day no one knew it was me
i had to do long distance traveling after working a  hour night shift after reaching my destination city i worked out and showered even after this i still had time to kill so i found a walmart and slept for  hr upon waking up i had to use the washroom i found a parking space relatively close to the walmart entrance so i could quickly step in and out upon pulling into the space i hit a new cadillac suv people saw told me i hit the car like i wasnt aware and took photos of me and my car i was going to wait for the owners to get out of walmart and i did a  visual inspection of each car ive never hit a car before after  years driving and idfk what came upon me but i saw more people approaching our cars and i got spooked all i could think in the moment was im  hours away from home its a parking lot and insurance is vague on crashes in parking lots and i left afterwards not even a minute after leaving i felt horrible and was shaky and even went onto a no exit street unintentionally  i didnt realize it was a dead end until i reached it is that a sign from the universe that i fucked up and should turn around and go back kinda like theres no way out of this dead end go back now but i fucking didnt i felt and feel brain dead hours after i dont know what i was thinking at the time  mins after crashing into the car i found a spot to calm down i googled the consequences of my actions too scared to be truthful with anyone in the world if found guilty for leaving the scene this is a hit and run and seriously illegal my car has some serious damage to it will cost a nice penny but i cant get over the idea of how i left the scene like that wtf 
my card kept declining cuz i forgot my pin and i didnt have cash on me so i j took the shit out of the package cuz i could not be any more bothered and left the package back on the shelf now im feeling the consequences am i cooked
when i was  i had a hermit crab who had a shell that was painted pink with a power puff girl on it blossom to be exact 
i had her for a while and thought she may be tired of her outfit shell and decided i should change her into something else i found a cute shell from a collection of sea shells i had and decided that was the one for her night out on the town 
now getting her out of her outfit was the issue i didnt know what to do and didnt want to yank her out but somehow thought breaking her out would be better so i got my hands on a hammer dont know how took her out to the front porch and smashed her shell open with it trying to get her out to change her my dad came out because he heard me screaming after i broke the shell open and he screamed too not knowing what to do and what the fuck his daughter just did lol 
long story short i brutally murdered my hermit crab at the age of  this still haunts me to this day and i feel so much guilt  years later my dad boyfriend and i are the only  that know about this until now 
rip blossom  
this happened about yrs ago i was about  at the time and she was 

my whole family was at the mall where they had a playplace my mom was shopping and my stepdad was supposed to be watching us well my little sister wanted to climb this small bridge thing they had there the issue was the material it was made out of slippery plasticfoamcloth like film over it i have no clue how to describe it she couldnt climb it because she was so small and her socks made it too slippery for her so trying to be a helpful big sister i picked her up to try to put her on the bridge mind you this bridge was maybe ft tall at its highest well then i fell and i think i landed on her i caught myself to some extent but obviously not enough she started bawling her eyes out and my step dad ran over asking what happened i told him i didnt know and that i thought i saw some kid run into her and knock her over i lied because if i did tell the truth i would have been severely punished and berated despite it being an accident they took her to the hospital then came back to the mall to get the security footage of what happened the whole time im quietly crying because i felt bad turns out the mall did not have working security cameras over the playplace area i still feel bad about it but ultimately it was an accident they still dont know to this day that it was my fault
i feel kinda bad abt it bc ive never shoplifted anything before thats it thank you for reading 
i met some people through the internet when i was about  i told them i was  at the time and thats that but im still friends with them today currently  and they think im  years older than i am still 

im constantly paranoid now and feel like theyre going to target me if they find out my real age i never lied to them out of malicious intent i just wanted people to play games with i know part of me is just being paranoid and they wont likely target me none of them have my real name but i live under constant stress that theyll find me 

i regret not being honest 
so my friend has always made those stupid jokes where he makes up scenarios in his head that he can run from the cops because motorcycles are difficult to catch in reality its because they dont want to cause a crash so theyll call off the chase most of the time i mean most people have made up those scenarios before so its really not that concerning however he seemed very serious about this and he has a reputation for committing to an act he claims he will do so it was somewhat concerning but still not enough to sabotage someones stuff however when he bought a bike i asked him why in specific and he said he wanted to try and run from the cops now this kid has done some pretty idiotic things in the past but this is on a new level of stupidity i wasnt really sure whether or not he was joking however i work as an emt and i have seen exactly what happens to people who try to run from the cops on bikes and i would never forgive myself if i was the one scraping his guts off of the road all because he wanted to do something he thought was cool dont ask me how committing a felony is cool but whatever so one time when he was out me and my friend pulled a stakeout and when the time was right we screwed around with the motor enough to the point where we thought it would be unable to drive however turns out it wasnt and he crashed on the highway sorry buddy but he was completely fine which is why you always wear a helmet so i suppose task failed successfully i suppose this is more of an am i the asshole thing but i think what i did was one of those wrong things for the right reason sort of things
as the title says i  at the time  now touched a girls thigh i had a crush on her and i for some reason thought that was an ok way of showing it i know i should have just told her i know i should have realized what i was doing i hate myself for what i did i had and still have thoughts about cutting off my hands to ensure it will never happen again shes traumatized because of me i would do anything to repay her for what i did i know i should have been a better friend to her i should never have done what i did to her im a monster

it wasnt just that that i did i also did some other questionable stuff during that time i asked her if she had a snapchat on the first day of meeting which was weird of me later on i asked if we could turn on snapmaps to see if we were close to eachother and there was another time when i spammed the groupchat with borderline porn

ive honestly changed now or at least i hope i have i want to help anyone i can i want to actually be a good friend i want to be there for people i want to be as nice a person i can be im sorry 
i used it to order myself  worth of food then threw it away 
ive been in an offandon relationship with some one for  years or so sometimes weve cohabitated other times weve had our own places and just chose which house to stay at either way taking out the trash and the recyclables has always been my responsibility but the thing is the general bin is always a few steps closer than the recyclable one  my partner takes their carbon footprint very seriously and if they were to find out it probably wouldnt be grounds for another breakup but id definitely be sleeping in the guest room for a bit anyway i decided to take the extra few steps this morning and dispose of it properly and i feel like i did a really good thing today i think ill keep it up
i was the last person getting off of the plane and the wheels of my carry on got stuck in the gap between the plane and the floor of the loading bridge i didnt even bother looking behind me to pull it out because i was in a hurry so i just yanked harder apparently i yanked too hard because once it was free i heard a large crack i looked behind me and the back wheel had hit this very large glass door next to me it was still in tact but very much shattered i just maintained a completely neutral face and calmly caught up with my boyfriend to catch our connecting flight nobody saw it happen nobody went after me and this is the first time ive acknowledged it in any way shape or form since it happened that was around december so i feel its been long enough to come clean
weird one when i was a kid probably about  or so i was awful in school i had bad grades because i mucked about so much i was diagnosed with adhd eventually the teachers pulled me and my parents in and basically in short just said i was a shit show at school and they wanted to know why i didnt want to tell my parents that it was because i spent all my time messing about so i made up some bullshit about having spells where just blacked out and couldnt remember anything i think id actually just seen an episode of casualty where someone was having absence seizures so i probably just thought that would fit looking back obviously i know this was a very wrong thing to do but in a way it probably saved my life 

my parents took me to the doctor about these black outs and i remember i was absolutely shitting it because i knew my parents would be finding out id lied as soon as i got the tests they definitely knew i was lying already but it turned out on the eeg i actually did have bursts of seizure activity when i hyperventilated the mri also showed something on the brain that is harmless but that is a common feature in epilepsy patients so when all these tests came back i was absolutely in shock but i remember i was actually buzzing that i did have epilepsy because my parents wouldnt find out i lied i was having black outs i just didnt know i was having them and when i couldnt remember stuff i just put it down to the adhd

i got put on medication and got extra time in all my tests so for  year old me having an epilepsy diagnosis was a big win now at  i know that it really is not a big win epilepsy is horrible and i wouldnt wish it on anyone im lucky to only have focal seizures but even they are difficult to deal with but anyway lucky me eh 


during the summer of  i signed up for the free summer planet fitness membership i never been there before and wasnt familiar with the layout one time i went inside the bathroom and as soon as i went in i stood there confused for about  seconds and realized i was in the womens bathroom lol thankfully nobody was in the womens bathroom when i walked in my heart was racing and i left the bathroom immediately the men and women bathroom were very close together i walked out and thankfully everybody that was in the gym were busy so nobody saw me walk out or walk in the women bathroomim a guy the planet fitness is in downtown silver spring md if anyone was curious
i scratched a parked bmw while picking up food for an ubereats delivery the feeling of impact was barely noticeable but enough to make me check i saw the scratch on the other car but didnt see an equivalent scratch on my own car so in my rush and panic i told myself it must not have been me who did that and drove off i think i wouldve left a note right there if i had a pen and paper and wasnt in a rush i had left notes before it was stupid of me not to regardless it was only as i was on my way to deliver the food that i realized how stupid of a decision that was and when i went to check i noticed a scratch on my own car that mightve lined up i returned to the restaurant but they were already gone so i left my information with them and told them to give it to them if they came back and asked i feel horrible and im extremely paranoid that ill still be charged with a crime even after returning to leave the note because i dont know if thats enough i guess all i can do now is wait
jip took a kids banana at  because i was starving the teacher punished me and made me feel like garbage cant believe i remember this and nothing really else 
this is so stupid but i just want to put it out there i had a bottle to drink during office hours and ended up falling asleep in front of my laptop woke up a few minutes later head down on my laptop and ended up having keyboard marks on m forehead
i went to a concert last night my first concert and it was so crowded i couldnt move before i used my brain and used the wrapper in my pocket i stuck my gum to the bottom of this girls purse in front of me after i did it i remembered i still had the gum wrapper and tried to pull it off her bag but it was already stuck i dont know why i did it maybe the chaotic atmosphere but i would take it back if i could im hoping she was able to get it off when she found it
throwaway here

im a dude and when i was between the ages  i used to get my little brother who was between the ages  to sleep next to me

it wouldnt be actual sleep just light naps he would come to me wanting something eg the tv remote control i would tell him he has to sleep beside me for a little if he wants it hed be reluctant and annoyed but would eventually agree

so i would lie in my bed and hed be next to me id be on my side and hed usually be on his back sometimes id try and be the big spoon and cuddle him hed lie there frustratingly waiting for the nap to be over and constantly ask if its enough sometimes when he tried to get up id pull him closer

i would then let him go and give him whatever he came to get idk why i ever did this it was nothing sexual ive never gotten aroused by it or anything i just liked having him there close to me especially since he was so adorable

im sure he thought i was weird as hell looking back that was fucking weird and im horrified that i ever did that i feel like a pphile even though i never touched him inappropriately or even thought of him in a sexual manner ever i have also never been sexually attracted to kids or looked at child p

anyway this was very infrequent just happened here and there probably like  times in total i stopped eventually for some reason

i feel really bad for him that i ever did that am i a freak 

edit our relationship now is great he comes to me whenever he has issues wants somebody to talk to hes my favorite family member and im his going by his words
note i know lying is bad but please hear me out

trigger warning anxiety depression sexual assault 

so lets start from the beginning to sum it up im an indian girl with brown parents who had high expectations of me while i grew up  since i was younger the seed was planted for me to become a doctor and thats all i strived for the only problem was that i was diagnosed with depression at   years ago but no one took it seriously not me either 

the only subject i enjoyed in school was biology and maths so i was like sure i can become a doctor my first mistake was i wasnt good at chemistry so i couldnt apply for uk medical schools i also sucked at studying without external help so that should have been a sign still managed to get aaa in my a levels 

things were all good until i transferred to uoft in  uh yeah everything went downhill i was doing a double major and a minor in life sciences which sounds like oh youre so smart while saying it but i was struggling to say the least got really sick in  while doing summer classes and mcat prep took months to recover and whoop back down again due to resurfacing sexual trauma basically my mental health was splattered on the floor i was so anxious i would burst into tears at anyone raising their voice in my vicinity i could not meet any deadlines 

i was desperately trying to salvage good grades without taking time off or another semester cause i was already a year late i genuinely was so burnt out i scraped the bottom of the barrel and graduated with a  gpa yeah thats where i ended up in  i lied to my parents saying i applied for masters at uoft and said i just didnt get in 

went home from june to october  my mental health declined even more due to my parents berating me didnt know it was even possible and i took like  months to recover after coming back to toronto mind you im financially dependent on my parents have been applying for jobs but no luck as of yet  

uh but i repeated my mistake of telling my parents that i applied for masters again this time all over ontario and the us but haha my gpa and lack of work experience cause i was chasing med school led me nowhere i was too scared so i didnt apply anywhere cause i wont get in anyway

fast forward april  of course my father is asking questions he doesnt believe i applied anywhere accurately but now im screwed cause hes asking for evidence that i applied please give advice and if youre telling me to just say the truth at least tell me how

thanks save me im pretty terrified but i think telling the truth will also be freeing im so exhausted 
so basically when i was like  years old when i was at shop with my mom i always  went to fridges just to break ice creams and then putting them back into this day i dont why i did that and i know it sounds hilarious but i still dont why i even remember that
some people are quite influential in school and they can quite literally make or destroy ur school life   when i was  i was pretty popular in school  as i was in basketball team  

there was a girl in other sectionshe always seemed like this narcissistic and self obsessed girl she asked me out and i rejected her  later that day as  i was abt to go home i checked my bag and my phone was missing mostly every student was gone it was a big thing for me to carry phone that time  i checked everywhere asked teachers but nth  i was really scared cause of my father  my father scolded me really hard  the next day teachers asked everyone abt it but nth was found  but the day after when we had games period the teacher who was helping me find my phone saw an other section girl in our class putting my phone in my bag  yes she was the girl who proposed me  she confessed in front of principal that she only wanted to scare me she had no intention of stealing it her mistake was she came back to return my phone  her parents were called  i was pretty relieved i got my phone back  i told everything abt it to my parents my mom told me to forgive and ignore and  dont seek revenge i was furious why shouldnt i 

next day i told my friends what happened told them to not talk to her  and it spread like wildfire  she didnt even said sorry  for a week atleast after that she started approaching me whenever i was alone she apologized  she wanted to be friends she didnt have that smerk look which she had before  i got to know that she is being bullied like students  eating her lunch  taunts in classes  writing with marker on shirt and all it made me angry that she is only being kind cause she want this to end  i started ignoring her more blatantly idk if this gave motivation to others or what but her bullying only worsen it became a fun thing for everyone  i was aware but didnt know it was this severe until i was called in the office  

my teacher and that girls mother was sitting there as teacher explained me that its been really tough for that girl past a year and as she was continuing thats when her mother snapped  she started scolding me that  its all my fault  u r heartless u should be in prison and started crying and just left the room  i was on the verge of cryingi was  that time  and i was angry too like she did bad to me and  i thought to be the bigger person and im getting blamed  i was too childish to realise she just wanted to vent out my teacher realised my emotions she calmed me and  she also said that other kids look up to me so if i just be friends with her maybe her bullying will stop  i was still angry why everyone is taking her side forget abt being the bigger person i will do the worse to her  

as i was returning from office it was already past half an hour the classes ended as i was going to get my bag i met her in the alleyway
and i just cant erase this image of her from my mind  she didnt have that confident posture like she used to  the two cuts in her left wrist  was clear and there was a linear bruise in her bicep it  seemed like from a stick  she was just looking down  my whole anger just vanished 
are u ok i stuttered ya ya im good thnx for asking  she replied smiling and then rushed down the alleyway  i was  confused like just moment ago i was so angry now this  what should i do  after a week or two her father got transferred as he was in defence and never got to meet her again  

now that i recall school it was really good mostly happy memories but what about her maybe i could have helped her 
hey everyone ive got a story to share thats been weighing on my mind for a while back when i was  i used to play some pretty silly pranks on our family cat rose im talking about stuff like feeding her ketchup yeah i know not my finest moment and even shutting her out at night not cool i know but theres one thing i did that i cant shake off one day i thought itd be fun to toss rose into our backyard jacuzzi while my parents were inside it was supposed to be a harmless game but things went south real fast poor rose didnt make it out and i was left with a whole lot of guilt

i panicked and hid her body in our attic thinking i could bury the truth along with her but man that smell it stuck around for way too long a constant reminder of what id done

fast forward to college and im rooming with someone who has a cat named rose crazy coincidence right seeing that name again hit me like a ton of bricks making me realize just how much i regret what happened

ive been carrying this guilt for years now but im determined to make things right its a reminder to treat animalsand everyone elsewith kindness and respect
im a new driver ive had my licence for less than a month and i failed my exam once before i passed and im terrified of my drivers being taken away because of how expensive it is

im working part time at a school and i had my car parked in the school parking lot and when i was leaving the parking spot i scratched another car it was not very noticeable i went and checked and logically my drivers licence wouldnt be taken for this but i was so scared it would i just got back in my car and left

i need to go back tomorrow yknow job and im so scared someone saw me and the person i did that to will be angry and ask me to fix it im barely managing to survive on the money me and my family make and this would break the bank

i didnt scratch it on purpose but i was fully aware that leaving without even a note was wrong and i should have just gone back inside and ask for the car owner or just wait for them to leave too

ive been sobbing none stop since i got home i spent the entire drive home considering going back and knowing im too much of a coward and too afraid to do so

i just need to let this out im so sorry to the person whos car i scratched if it were me id probably be pissed but i cant pay or risk having to pay i just hope no one saw me and that i can take this to my grave i dont wanna tell this to anyone
last year i was itching trying to get some attention from my friends theyre my closest friends but sometimes its just the two of them so i tried to make myself better and made them jealous as if they would even notice 

i made another separate account on my insta and me and well myself had matching profile pictures nobody seemed to notice and i got kind off mad but i wasnt really expecting somebody to notice either i mean it is just a matching profile picture 

so i talked to myself and screenshotted the messages and put them on my stories eventually they catch up and asks me who that was i had to come up with a fake name and told them it was my online best friend
they told me i finally got another friend other then them 

i was craving for even a bit of their attention and i never seem to get it so i kinda gave up told my friends my friend ended our friendship and it was back to normal again

i deleted that account of course
back in th grade i went to school with a girl who was slower compared to the rest of us like she had difficulty learning and reading and her performance during exams was  below average once we had to submit our notes for correction and mine were incomplete out of fear i said that the girl had borrowed my notes but was absent that day when infact she hadnt the next day when she heard of it she screamed at me and said i lied i being the little twerp i was started crying and acted like the victim everyone took my side for whatever reason for the next week or so she got a lotta shit for stealing my notes both the teachers and students ignored and dissed her after a while she left the school and got held back a year 
its been  years since the incident i never saw or talked to her again i just wish i had the chance to apologise for what i did before she went away
i f have always been kinda sensitive i regret what i did but at the time i thought it was justified my brother m and me were fighting verbally but he took it too far and hit me with the studs of his football boots theyre new and he was really excited to get them but i hated that he could use them against me so i told my mum what hed done and she just said to both of us guys stop fighting  he smirked at me and said some remark about me being a looser which really set me off i was on my period that week so i was a lot more emotional but i went upstairs and was crying i dont know what came over me but i just wanted my mum to pity me and understand how unfair i found it so i got my phone and i started hitting the mark with it soon it was very purple and i guess i hit it too much but i didnt care i showed my mum and she got really really mad at my brother i hadnt ever seen her properly yell before but she was screaming at him that my wrist could be broken in the end she took his new football boots away because he couldnt be trusted i feel awful about it but i also cant come clean otherwise my mum will make me seek help
everytime when i have to pee it comes suddenly and the urge is very strong when i have to pee i have to use the bathroom now it feels like if i hold it im going to pee myself at work we only have single use bathroom and only one person can be in there one time when i had to pee really bad i needed to go in the bathroom but somebody was in there went to another one and somebody was in there too like literally it was so intense i felt like i wanted to piss my pants or go use the womens bathroom i didnt know how long these people would be in there but i got extremely irritated how people were in the bathroom and i couldnt use it i decided to just go in and use the womens restroom i didnt get caught using it though and like literally no joke everytime when i get this intense urge in public theres always something wrong with the bathrooms once i was at a gas station and couldnt use the mens restroom because it was down for maintenance i just went to the back of the gas station and peed it was at night and nobody saw me even though my house is  mintues away i couldnt hold it until i got home
now there is absolutely no excuse for this but at the time i was being severely abused by my father like being punched and stuff and i am autistic and ocd diagnosed

again not an excuse but just to give some context

i lived in a seperate country as my best friend at the time and my friend told me about a girl at her school who had been calling black people the n word and shouting it at them in the street me and my friend then had the idea to make an instagram account bullying this girls badly drawn on eyebrows the account was literally called girls nameseyebrows or something like that 

it started off as light stuff well not light at all but idk how else to put it just posting this girls eyebrows everyday with a stupid caption until the girl and her friends found it and got involved my friend started calling this girl mean names like slut telling her to kill herself calling her the n word and i joined in 

we got quite graphic with it too like giving them ways they could end their lives for being racist while saying the n word ourselves to give them a taste of their own medicine we were really fucking dumb it was really bad really really bad

then the girls friend got involved ill call her e e was a practicing wiccan and told me she cursed me and made a video of her doing it she put things like rusty needles in a jar with my name in it

she didnt target my friend who started it just me for some reason in fact the girls other friends still follow my friend to this day and act like she didnt do anything 

i have made multiple attempts to apologise sincerely genuine guilt to the girl and her friends but everytime i do i get blocked or they start commenting stuff on my instagram account about how im a bad person 

its been a few years now since it all happened and the last time i even spoke to their friends however the guilt doesnt stop

i have prayed to god almost every single day for my actions i have cried i have asked my muslim family to pray for me to get the curse to leave i am convinced i have been cursed i have bad ocd and i have constant thoughts about e and the curse she put on me

im  now and e is  now and i doubt she even remembers it but it still makes me want to throw up im scared that the curse is the reason things go right in my life then go wrong 

im scared she will find my account one day and message my boyfriend telling him what i did 
the last time i tried to apologise to her and explain the situation i was in at the time she just said it was good my dad beat me and then got her friends to comment on my page about how evil i am and that im racist etc 

she is also the scariest person ive ever seen in my life shes about  tall and just idk looks really really scary like her face literally haunts me everytime i see it and i see it a lot because i stalk her instagram and tiktok every single day to see if shes posted about me im also just weirdly obsessed with her to the point i want to be her i compare myself to her all the time because yeah she looks scary but its in a pretty way like shes drop dead gorgeous way more gorgeous than me

it takes everything not to message her now apologising and telling her i wish i was dead for what i did but i know that if i did shed harass me and my boyfriend or message him convincing him to break up with me

my boyfriend doesnt know about any of this and im so scared hell think im evil if i tell him even though i think i should so that he knows who hes dating and how horrible i am he deserves to know

how do i get over this should i just end my life at this point for what i did because i dont think i will ever ever get over it 



anonymous for obvious reasons 

i used to work for a company and was put on a job where id have to travel by train to various sites across the uk these journeys were normally always around  hours 

id never know how long i would be needed on site that day so my workplace would book me an open return ticket the open return was valid for  month and came with a hefty price tag of around  but it was great for peace of mind knowing i wouldnt miss my train home

i started to get cheesed off and extremely exhausted of all the travelling i was one of the lowest paid at my company but had to do the furthest and most travelling nobody else would get put on these jobs 

one particular week in the middle of summer the heat caused some significant delays to train journeys where tracks had melted yes melted and other various heat related problems 

i was stuck on a boiling hot train at the end of a long day stood up because open returns dont include a seat reservation the train had left the station but got stuck just outside so nobody was allowed to leave the beads of sweat were dropping off me and several other people who i was squashed in like sardines with stood in the vestibule of this train 

i was around  hours late home that day

throughout the journey there were tannoy announcements about claiming compensation for the delayed journey via train companies website i thought id look into it so i could let my company know 

this is where it got interesting

you could claim for the delayed journey and either get the money refunded straight to the original payment method or get the compensation sent to you via cheque in the post to a chosen address with a  hour delay i was entitled to a  refund all i had to do was fill in the online form and attach a photograph of my delayed ticket 

a few days later a cheque for  arrived to my home address i waited to see if my company were notified and if they would mention anything but they didnt so i cashed it 

my next few trains went along with no hiccups but i knew of other trains that would be delayed for whatever reason i found a website that documented all train times actual times delayed times length of delays you could filter it to certain stations and certain train journeys and you could search up to the previous  months 

with my open return ticket which was valid for a month i started watching this website for updates on delayed trains specifically from the station my ticket would be to  from id find a delayed train that would fall within the time frame of my ticket and put a delayed compensation form in claiming to be on that train and get the compensation via cheque straight to me 

in total i reckon i made around kk doing this over a relatively short period

i no longer work for this company and they have no idea i was doing this

i kind of saw it as compensation for the shitty jobs i was given and my low pay but it was at the expense of the rail company not my company and i do feel somewhat guilty for that 

ive been hiding this guilt and its building inside of me and is causing me anxiety and depression so its best if i get it out i dont have anyone to really confess this too so ill say it here i use a voice changer and lie about my age i lied and manipulated people to like me bc im to much of a bitch to be myself im young and the friends i like are older and my voice and age just wont cut it so i lied about my voice and my age saying i was  when im  im trying leave this in the past and start anew and this time me and only me i know ive fcked up and everything ive done is all my fault im restarting but this time ill be real
this happened roughly  years ago 

when my friend begun highschool she is two years younger than i she unfortunately joined the wrong crowd she started vaping smoking weed and drinking all at the age of  i unfortunately at the time was also vaping and drinking and although she wasnt initially influenced by me i cant help but feel as i somewhat encouraged the behaviour as whenever we hung out i would occasionally be the one providing the alcohol and vapes during this time her parents were having issues and her father left the family she fell into a deep depression and was diagnosed with several other mental illnesses that i wont be listing her behaviour became very destructive and her family became increasingly worried with her actions her mum and brother went through her belongings and found several vapes and bottles of alcohol and she was grounded for a very long time causing her to become even worse her older sister at the time was friends with my older sister and had come over for my sisters birthday i joined them as they talked in my sisters room there her sister confessed her severe worries towards my best friend and i came to a realisation as to how bad things really were i told her everything from the very beginning all the times she had smoke weed when she drank where she had gotten the vapes from how the people she hung out with were not the best etc i even showed and sent her multiple photos with evidence of her having vaped drank and smoked her sister was insanely grateful for all the information and she later showed her mum when my best friend found out that someone had revealed all her secrets she had an episode which im not even quite sure wether thats the right term for it my friend told me how she would never forgive her sister and their relationship was ruined forever which they previously had an insanely good bond i felt so insanely guilty and horrible knowing i had been the one to do that to her eventually things got better and her mental health improved significantly her bond with her sister was repaired however she still tells me that its something she will never be able to forgive her for 

to this day she doesnt know it was me she has absolutely no idea who it was yet the worst part is that she has literally zero suspicion of me because she wouldnt be able to image that i would betray her trust to that degree and that leaves me with a pit in my stomach every time i think about it im so torn on wether its something to eventually confess to her or just leave it be 
ive been keeping this secret for about four years all those years ago i was going through what was at the time the most serious and traumatic breakup i was vulnerable i had been through years of this toxic relationship 

i lived with my mom at the time and she has quite the slew of back and health problems she got prescribed percocet and very often tried to give me them i had tried them before but they made my stomach hurt so i often turned her down she continued to offer them to me 

one day i decided to take one i was hurting from work or something and i snorted it it was great my stomach didnt hurt and i felt better she continued to give me pretty much as much pills as i wanted and even offered some when i didnt ask 

she moved into my grandmothers house once she went to assisted living my mother gave me her old pills too 

now four years later im a functioning addict as much as i can be nobody at work knows and i only just realized how fucked up it is to give your child prescriptions idk if this is my fault or not but opioid addiction is a helluva thing ive gone from percocet to oxycodone to morphine hydrocodone lortabs anything like that i will do to stave off withdrawals

i got some fake oxycodone s one time and did them anyways they were fentanyl coming off of that put me in the hospital it was the worst pain ive ever felt in my life i cried so much and the morphine they ivd me in the hospital barely touched the pain unfortunately i guess im so far gone that wasnt even a wakeup call for me although i refuse to touch fake pills again 

ive lost myself so much because of my drug use and wasted so much time i really do want to quit and i hate that ive ever done them if i wouldve known how bad they were i wouldve said no never done them but i was ignorant to the true seriousness of it until it was too late 

im at a breaking point and have been for a long time i dont know what i will do but i have to move past this im tired of keeping this secret from the world from my friends my family even its time to let them go somehow 

edit theres been a lot of negative comments and assumptions here no i am not blaming my mother for my mistakes i did not include all details here its a confession to get off my chest and if you cant be nice youll be reported and blocked 
so when i was like  or something i was into naruto and stuff and i thought it would be pretty fucking sweet to put on some naruto music and chase my friend around the house with some shitty foam scythe thing 

he was hiding in a closet and i could see his legs sticking out from underneath a rack of clothes and because i wanted to be scary or something i pretended i didnt know where he was

some background info is i had this like foam scythe thingie i got from a halloween costume a couple years prior it was pretty soft but the interior had this like hard pvc pipe in it

i then proceeded to yell some cringe shit and throw the scythe in a perfect spiral of the likes of peyton manning it hit him and i hear him start crying and he comes out with blood dripping down his face and into his hands 

what followed was the worst thing i have ever experienced in my life and probably ever will my mom came down the hallway and saw him bleeding all over the bathroom sink and asked me what happened 

we both agreed to never tell her the truth and we told her he ran into a door 

i still have not told anyone about this in years and have lost contact with that friend

also ps i dont watch anime anymore because everytime i do i get secondhand embarrassment thinking about what i did

edit i also never turned the music off so my mom walked into two  year old boys huddled around a sink one bleeding profusely out of his nose all while some like dramatic action music was playing 
literally every decision is made drunk i review budgets firehire employees review contracts for customers and subs send emails attend meetings etc 

all while blackout or at least buzzed
i was watching one of the smosh reddit stories episodes the chaotic episode and someone confessed on here to faking being sick to get out of going to school and while i never did that it triggered another memory 

when i was about  or  in the late s before i knew what i was doing i would often use a sickness i had a few years prior to get out of pe class and my mum would just believe me and send me to school with an excuse note and id be able to get out of class 

but one day she didnt sign a note and i really didnt want to do the activity that day so i forged my mums signature i traced it and practiced it over and over again until eventually i had something that could pass for her handwriting it worked my mum was none the wiser and so i did it again i didnt abuse my power too much because i knew the teacher would get suspicious and call my mum and id get in trouble and i really didnt want to so i would participate in class more often than not and only use my newfound power as a last resort 

because of this and the fact that my usual handwriting is cursive and no one can understand it ive been able to develop a talent for writing in different fonts and styles

but one day one of my friends saw me faking a letter and asked about it because we were close i told her the truth and she asked me to do one for her i did and we both got out of pe eventually word spread around my year group that this was something i could do and so some people would come and ask me for help to the point where i had rules 

 come prepared with a viable excuse
 come with an example of your parents handwritingsignature
 grass me up and i lie im very good at it thanks to a life with narcissistic and emotionally unavailable parents and my older sisters goodie twoshoes reputation passed down to me too who are the teachers going to believe the wellbehaved heavily bullied younger sister of a straight a student or a kid who barely does their homework and has a record of detentions for misbehaviour 

the third one never would have happened anyway given that my secondary school was in a working class neighbourhood in the uk and you learn from a young age that no one likes a telltale 

and so i developed a small business every lunchtime breaktime or periods before class i would charge p per letter and forge my classmates parents signatures to help them get out of class i would use that money to buy myself snacks at school or at the bakery or convenience store down the street after school

the teachers never confronted me about this my mum  years later still has no idea well why did you stop i hear you ask well it did end up becoming too risky someone from a different year group who had a sibling in my sisters year found out what i was doing and i didnt want the heat so i only did it for me and my best friend again and i kept it on the dl

tldr i forged countless parents signatures to help me and my classmates get out of pe class for a small price
when i was in high school my friend j and i used to raid his freezer for those mini dove ice cream bars we would go stand on his deck in his back yard and chuck them across the street at the house across from him we would occasionally switch it up with eggs i have no clue how we never got caught cause we did it like every day i even remember one saturday we saw the guy power washing his siding that night we did it again 
when my twin bro and i were  or  we used to roll up a bunch of paper as ammo and maneuver around the living room furniture with our straws like we were scout snipers and take turns shooting soggy spit wads at our uncles forehead while he was propped up in his wheelchair in front of the television he was slow to react so when hed start turning his head in the direction of our shots we would low crawl to a new position for our next shots

looking back i cant believe the assholes we were our parents would have whooped our asses if we had been caught which would have been well deserved im sure karma has caught up to us by now
i know it sounds fucked up it kinda is but i was a kid and i thought it was a scary video so i played it next to my grandmother in her hospital bed she died two and a half months later and thats the only memory i have of her
going into this just know that i already know how awful this makes me sound but i am at such a loss and just dont know what the correct kind responsible thing to do is 

so for context i am a  year old mom to  kids who are amazing literally the light of my life and source of joy i work part time from home and homeschool  of my kids so i am home pretty much all of the time we have a nice little fenced in back yard we have a little house 
we are the poster family for people who should get a dog right 
so for christmas the year before last my husband and i got the kids a pup from my bosses dog who had puppies she is a black labradoodle and we brought her home when she was  weeks old 
it started with normal puppy stuff which was fine teething and jumping but a normal pup we cleaned our basement and turned it into the dog room so we wouldnt have to put her in a kennel when we are gone or asleep we put a tv down there and she has a nice bed and toys my husband worked with her so much the first year and honestly his work schedule picked up and she wont listen to me she really only will listen to him and hes only home for a few hours a day 
this dog has been the biggest challenge of my life my hands are so full and i didnt expect this to be the way it is 
this dog will go at almost any length to eat poop i mean she will chew a hole in the side of the trash can to get to a dirty diaper she is obsessed with our cats litter box and i had to go buy a  little box so she couldnt get inside and she just gets her head stuck in the hole and boom giant cat litter mess she wont eat dog food like any kind except the most expensive stuff from the vet so i started making her food from scratch and its a lot of work she not only loves poop but literally anything within  miles thats dead she will find and roll in she is a long haired dog and gets so gross i have to give her a bath at least once a week and its hard to do with  kids under  trying to catch some of the action she stinks andi hate it nows it rains like every single day and it made it so much worse i thought her and my cat would get along after a while but its been almost two years and they still cant be kept in the same room now our cat is getting older and because our dog is so obsessed with her littler box now she wont even use it and im so paranoid about my house and kids and clothes smelling like cat pee that i am uncomfortable in my own home she dug a hole under the fence and got out for three days while we were on vacation and had a house sitter she got picked up and when we brought her home she was covered in fleas we spent over  treating her our cat and home and i still see them once and a while keep in mind we are a lower income family my husband works and i do what i can but we arent rich by any means its so much to keep up with every day  my mental health is suffering i always feel this glooming sense that i am a bad person for not liking this animal as much as i should  i know everyone says you are supposed to get so close to your pets but i just cant its always something and theres so much more i could type but you probably get the picture but heres my problem my kids love this dog they want her around all the time but i cant handle it all day every day we cant get school done we cant eat our meals we cant have shoes out or a trash can or laundry basket out sometimes i wish that when she gets out of the fence a better family will find her and keep her she deserves better 
i have been a very terrible son to my mom caused her a lot of pain with my mean words and body language even though im well aware of all the hardships shes been through for me and a bad elder brother and set a wrong example to him 

ive done a lot of wrongs primarily due to my temper im trying to do right by them and also working on my temper issue 

i wish i was a better person im lucky i have them to support me when im down ive started to find ways to spend more time with them instead of friends because ive started to understand things better   

so i was in first year of highschool trying weed and loving it first big parties ect
i was super shy and borderline crippled about girls but still had friends got invited in a huge shisha party and started to drink a lot i ended up in the backyard we were at least  there talking with a group of friends and that girl that i didnt know was super drunk like me we were all from the same highschool i precisewe were standing next each other while in a circle of ppl talking i just placed my hand on her ass for some fking reason it felt wrong doing it but i couldnt help she then raised her eyes to me and then looked somewhere else like nothing happened the worst is my hand stayed there for soo long it felt like several minutes i cringed and felt horrible over that story for years especially since some friends noticed anyway i saw her maybe a week later the scene felt like some higher entity planed it i was coming back in the highschool for class and she was coming out the entire front and inside court of the place was dead empty not a bloody sound even if losts of ppl hang out there usually she walked out on the front bridge as i engaged on the other end she saw me i looked at her and felt super bad was awaiting disgust hate or fear but then she gave me a bright smile we never met outside of the party no common friend so she can only remember me from the party this is one of the most bizarre stuff i ever witnessed in my life
i mean she probably just didnt care but damn thats some serious level of chillness

edit  wow i didnt expect a storm of conflicting thoughts like that i have written this fast in a one shot idea just because i discovered this sub not thinking i could reach so many people i would have definitely not have taken such a light tone if i had known i want to say i know there is nothing right about it those who called me a creep are correct i acted like a creep back then im sorry about those of you who lived a sexual assault and might have been hurt reading this im in no way saying that it was okay or anyone should do this i was a frustrated and anxious kid and that led me to touch a girl without her consent alcohol is a big factor but doesnt excuse anything be sure of one thing though i didnt only cringe at it i hated myself and found myself disgusting i never did anything like it again discovering sexual pulsion and alcohol at the same time as a boy is dangerous for girls i understood how strong alcohol was and how bad the consequences of my actions could get if i let my pulsions be stronger than my values
now for clarity the whole point of my post was the instant on the bridge what i couldnt wrap my head around was the timing she raised her head from her phone saw me and instantly smiled i dont know how she could have felt then but i expected a first negative reaction at least some fear or discomfort before she put up a defense mechanism

im astounded at how some would kill me if they saw me rn and some saw this as a potential start of romance or hookup
i only wish peace to all of you you dont do what i did dont let others do it and that you are confident enough to just try to seduce normally and not becoming a monster
as title im in a bad place mentally my own incompetence has led me next to financial ruin and ill soon be homeless someone i dearly care about has effectively told me to kick rocks should be clear these are separate issues which breaks my heart over the last like hours ive gone and walked the line from suicidal ideation to actively making plans and arranging affairs for killing myself i feel live even if i were to keep living id just repeat this process and its not worth it the stress was making me bug out and i felt like i needed to speak to someone who i could voice my thoughts to

so i called my mother who is completely unaware at my current state of affairs she lives in a different city and im known for going radio silent for awhile so shes not aware of what going on in my life until i tell her whats happening i didnt think about what i was gonna say when she picked up so when she picked up and asked me how things were going my brain blanched i couldnt tell my mother about all in my life i couldnt just throw that stress on her shes too loving and shes worked too hard her whole life explicitly for her family shes getting closer to  and the stress of hearing all that would take years off her life 

so i lied to her i told her i was doing fine in fact i told her i was working hard and just got a new apprenticeship that things were looking good even though i had a lot of work in front of me i checked on her and all confirmed she was okay and had a good week and we finished the call   it hurt so bad to say and honestly i dont know that what i just did was any better than if i told her everything mind you im no saint im not above lying in most situations but i love my mom and i dont want her to worry that she missed all the signs and could have done something 

i felt a lot better having a normal conversation with my mom but i also feel the dissonance of lying to her to such a degree splitting my skull in half right now im just hollow i feel like theres a lot im doing wrong but m maybe i can avoid lying to my mom  or maybe not  idk but i needed to get this think off my chest 

edit adding my update comment to the main post

as an update i called her back i didnt tell her everything i couldnt tell her how close i was to killing myself and i probably never will i told her about my situation and i told her that im exhausted and my head is probably not in the best space she told me i could always go back to the family home and that she was glad i came back and told her the truth she also pushed for therapy again and i told her id go im not keen on it but at this point its probably better than what ive been doing
so this one time i guess around th grade i slapped a friends butt always felt embarrassed after that idk why i did that ig i thought it was funny idk  they were always nice to me after that so idk if they didnt care or what but goodness i know this is so tame compared to other confessions but it has plagued my mind for soo long atp lol
growing up i was regularly hit by my parents left on the side of the road and my dad was always high or drunk this context explains where my behaviour stemmed from but it does not forgive it i would chase her and beat her regularly and i feel absolutely awful about it now i know how much i made her life a living hell and i wish i could fix it i wish there was something i could do to go back in time and stop myself this was from when i was first able to throw a punch till i was  and kicked out for the first time 
edit my sister and i have a wonderful relationship now  years on from this with a shared understanding of how fucked up our parents were i am very grateful to be her maid of honor at her wedding next year and amazed to see the beautiful person shes become 
when i stay in hotels which is like twice a year i draw full page drawings on the blank pages in either the front or back of the bible in the night stand nothing mean or offensive but generally abstract pen drawings ive always wanted to do something like this on the back of the wall art but they are always attached so i cant 
nothing else to comment
so my coworker has already made the assumption long time ago that i have a group of friends but i technically dont have a group that hang out with at all but today she randomly decided to ask me about where they live their nationality what school they go to and i had to just lie about all the details and it makes me feel terrible i tend to keep to myself and im very picky about who i choose to open up to and my boss and my coworkers are definitely not the type i feel comfortable saying things to so that definitely put me on the spot i just felt like i had to lie because i can imagine how awkward the situation would be if i tell her that i dont actually have a friend group 
i took someones steroids and filled the bottles with vegetable oil
im shaking with stomach pains as i write this but if i dont share it now i might actually not survive the guilt has gotten too unbearable im not looking for sympathy because i dont deserve it i know this will get tons of hate and that is all deserved im the worst type of person in the world and i dont know how or why it happened but i cant live with myself anymore

when i was a kid young enough to not know any better but old enough that i shouldve i guess i abused my pets one cat and one dog i wont sugarcoat it i occasionally used them for sexual gratification im female so there was was no penetration of any kind but i essentially used the warmth of their body and rubbed up against them this went on for i think roughly two years mostly with the cat and im fucking disgusted by it i hate myself every second that goes by 

i never ever thought what i was doing was animal abuse i loved animals and i still do but for some reason i thought what i was doing was harmless and wouldnt affect the animals at all that it was weird but not bad when i got older and learned that what i did was bestiality and that it is animal abuse i felt my body start to reject itself in a sense i honestly cant tell you why i did it i dont think i was ever sexually attracted to them just curious and lonely and sexually frustrated i hadhave intrusive thoughts and couldnt make them stop and decided to act on them out of desperation looking back i also suspect previous sexual encounters as a child im hesitant to say sa as i have experienced that relatively recently karma i suppose may have contributed to my skewed understanding of sex consent and morals as a whole but none of this is an excuse i didnt even really connect the pieces until this year 

it doesnt matter though i cant tell anyone cant apologize to the animals because its been so long i was able to convince my parents to send the cat away when i got older and i can only hope she found a better more loving family but i blame myself endlessly for letting it get to that point i think my recent sa has made these memories come out of hiding or at least is making me face the music because no matter what happened to me i deserved it i deserve every bad thing that happened and is going to happen to me because how much more disgusting more dangerous more horribly morally fucked up can you get people tell me im kind and a good person and deserve to be happy but they have no idea what ive done and how wrong they are ive disappointed everyone lied to everyone about who i truly am it doesnt matter how remorseful i am how different i am today and how long ago it was i cant go back and change it i did it ill have always done it and that makes me want to die more than anything the only reason i havent is because im too scared of death

to anyone who has taken the time to read all this thank you and im sorry i hate the thought of exposing people to this fucked up shit but im lost i cant lose my therapist other counselors are on a waitlist i cant go to confession because im not religious and if i told my friends or family i would lose every single one of them and im too much of a coward to lose more people i care about in my life im just so fucking sorry
recently my wisdom teeth have become an issue one top back one is basically crumbling in my mouth way back about a year or two ago before this tooth was ever an issue i scheduled a dentist appointment because i hadnt been to one in  years i figured i should go 

i also assumed my husband would go with me but he had work im scared of the dentist im terrified of the dentist and the doctor anything healthcare related im scared he wasnt interested in going he said i was an adult etc so i did the adult thing and chickened out instead of being a decent human being i didnt call and cancel because i didnt want to know if they were going to be upset with me about canceling with such short notice so i did what would make anyone upset and just didnt show up 

my teeth became an issue so i called and made an appointment fingers crossed maybe they wouldnt remember i ncns my last appointment this was a year after the ncns i go in alone again and the receptionist tells me im on a list so the dentist wont see me that day but i can reschedule awesome im mortified so embarrassed i debated not rescheduling but at the time my tooth was bothering me 

i didnt go to that appointment i chickened out because i figured everyone there would know me as the serial ncnser and be angry at me i dont want angry people working on my teeth when im already terrified of being there especially when im alone too 

that brings us to whats going on now my back top wisdom tooth broke i couldnt ignore it its stabbing and scratching my cheek and its broken i ignored it for a month before it broke again and began stabbing my cheek so its infected and painful 

i went to a different dentist and they did xrays i need to go to an oral surgeon they gave me a reference for an oral surgeon thats in network for my insurance but theyre about an hour away my husband cannot legally drive so thats a bummer its gonna be impossible getting someone to drive us when i have my wisdom teeth taken out i dont have anyone that can do it and he doesnt know of anyone who would be willing to do that and according to my husband i  cannot drive after even if im not sedated or put to sleep they  have to do either and i cant drive after  

so he heard that the dentist office i ncns will take wisdom teeth out i dont know why the dentist office i went to yesterday didnt tell me about it not that i want to go i very much want to avoid this place as much as possible this place is about five minutes away from where i live im willing to drive an hour to avoid it because i am so embarrassed 

but i might have to go there and i dont know if theyll even be willing to schedule and work on me since ive done this twice serves me right i got what i deserve for doing it but damn im even more scared of going 


hey reddit  
  
ive got to confess something thats been eating away at me for a while now when i was  i crashed my dads car but heres the kicker  to this day my dad thinks it was my brother  
  
let me set the scene for you it was late at night and i was out with some friends cruising around town in my dads car i made a stupid mistake took a turn too fast and ended up crashing into a lamppost classic teenager move right  
  
but instead of owning up to it i panicked and ran i left the scene hoping nobody would find out it was me and you know what they didnt instead my dad found the wrecked car the next morning and immediately assumed it was my brothers doing  
  
now my brother isnt exactly known for his stellar driving skills so it wasnt much of a stretch for my dad to believe it was him but deep down i knew the truth and the guilt has been eating away at me ever since  
  
its been two years and my dad still blames my brother for the crash every time he brings it up i cant help but feel like a total fraud my brother doesnt deserve to take the fall for my mistake but ive been too much of a coward to come clean  
  
so why am i telling you all this because i cant keep living with this lie weighing me down my brother doesnt deserve to be blamed for something he didnt do and my dad deserves to know the truth  even if it means facing the consequences of my actions  
  
to my dad if you ever read this which i doubt im sorry im sorry for lying to you and letting you believe that my brother was responsible for the crash and to my brother im sorry for letting you take the fall for my mistake you deserve better  
  
thanks for listening reddit it feels good to finally get this off my chest  

this is something that has been heavily weighing on my mind for the past couple weeks i simply forgot about it but am now coming to terms with how gross and disgusting my actions were that night for reference i was  at the time i also apologize if i seem to ramble on in the story just trying to get all my thoughts out

a couple years ago some buddies invited me to go out drinking with them and while i am not a heavy drinker nor enjoy the nightlife at all i decided to be open to something new and get out of the house at first im not really enjoying myself but as the night progresses and the drinks flow even an introvert like myself will become social

at some point i bump into a mutual friend of a friend lets call her sam shes a couple years older than me and weve always had pleasant interactions in the past i never thought twice about her since she lived in the next town over but tonight were really vibing and theres some light flirting going on i end up hanging out with her and her friend group for the next hour she buys me drinks i buy her drinks were just having fun and everythings going great eventually everyone starts heading home and she invites me to hang out and stay at her place for the night which i happily accept

once at her house she turns on some music and we continue our conversation over glasses of wine honestly im not expecting anything at this point im really just enjoying her company and we end up really connecting over the same music artist we like i also havent had much experience with girls and am still a virgin so i decide to take things slow and let her make any moves that said im thoroughly drunk by this point and my memory of that night is a little hazy but deep down theres no doubt how i wanted the night to end after  minutes or so she suggests we watch a movie and we move to the couch

let me preface this by saying we havent kissed or done much touching throughout the the whole night about  minutes in i decide to move closer and put my arm around her im generally a very passive person but in my drunken state i figure fuck it lets actually make a move  she leans into me a bit so i decide to go in for a kiss i mean theres just no way she isnt somewhat interested in me right surely all the signs were there turns out everything is a sign when you havent been in a relationship and a girl is being nice to you instead she pulls back tells me she thinks im cute but she isnt into me like that ok fine im a little confused and hurt but we go back to watching the movie she really was just being nice and we were just connecting as friends that should be great no harm no foul

except not my mind is spinning from the alcohol and i cant tell up from down i still have my arm around her and for some fucking reason move my hand lower to her thigh then slowly to her inner thigh and then continue up i dont know what i was thinking she rejected my advances once so obviously this is not okay shes frozen this whole time and then shouts no before my hand goes all the way i move away from her on the couch and after an awkward silence i profusely apologize and blame the alcohol she says its okay obviously its not and she goes to bed while i stay on the couch

as you can imagine the next morning was extremely awkward i break the silence and again apologize for my actions again blaming the alcohol which while impacted my decision making is no excuse for what i did she again said it was okay and that she wouldnt tell any of our friend groups what happened i left and that was that we havent seen or spoken to each other since

i quickly forgot about that night and moved on with my life thinking im an honorable and good human being and trying to live my life accordingly but im not deep down everyone has evil lurking and i witnessed mine i read stories about rape and sexual assault on reddit all the time and its so easy to judge those people from behind a computer screen and think i would never do that or i would do x and y differently  these past few weeks ive been doing some soul searching and needed to get this all out i dont drink anymore if that means anything i feel like shit even if it happened years ago as far as i know sam hasnt told anyone about that night im debating if i should i reach out to her and really explain how fucked up it was and really apologize that yes i sexually assaulted her but maybe this would hurt her more i dont know i guess thats it for now

edit there seems to be differing definitions of sexual assault and i dont need people commenting that i did nothing wrong or that she said its okay after or that her not saying anything leading up to the act is consent please see the following definition and do with it what you will rainnorg note the term explicit consent

xb

edit  i appreciate the many comments from everyone including dms from people whove both been a victim and perpetrator of sa i wasnt looking for any justifications for what i did i was a horrible person and know it and likely still carry a bit of that inside me which i will have to deal with for the rest of my life i mostly was just venting and needed a place to get this story out but lots of people ended up giving great advice along the way

general consensus seems to be that i absolutely should never contact her again as the risk of further trauma and pain to her is likely and it would just be to make myself feel better i can only hope she heals and gets the support she needs and i dont deserve her forgiveness it sounds like professional help in therapy may also benefit me and help me grow even if its just a couple sessions to reaffirm what i need to do i will also never get drunk again especially around women which is basically a given if i want to be better

this has been an eye opening experience into understanding myself and i hope no one makes the same mistake i did which isnt necessarily about sexual assault you should already know sa is bad and never do it i mean doing things you never thought in a million years you would do whether under the influence of any drug or not or under any extenuating circumstances learn who you are to the core of your being both the good and bad i promise you one day the bad impulses might take over in an irreparable way and you will be shocked and recoil from yourself it doesnt matter how easy it is for you to say otherwise and pretend you have it all figured out i was that person too

always do the right thing by yourself and others
im a registered nurse i started doing this when i was in nursing school i stopped when we started clinicals

i actually posted this here once before but took it down since the comment section turned into a dumpster fire of hate im reposting because it might give you some insight into the mind of someone who has fd i also just want to get it off my chest

if youre curious about anything you can ask it in the comments as long as youre polite and dont ask anything too personal i will try to answer

i dont think i have fd anymore in the last three years i have only been to the doctor  times three were just me being responsible and getting my annual checkup and the other two were for legit issues before that i was a professional patient id be at the doctors at least once a month with madeup symptoms if i couldnt see my pcp i would go to urgent care or even the er i faked symptoms and knew just what to say so theyd take me seriously not too much that theyd know im lying

how did i pay for all this

my insurance covered it i never had to pay more than a  copay i did my homework to make sure i wouldnt get hit with any nasty surprises afterthefact well except this one time something weird happened and i had to pay an affiliate for xrays even though it was in the same hospital i had a  bill for that

the only advice i can give you from this hot mess is to know your insurance policy like the back of your hand start reading it today they usually have people who can help you understand it take notes trust me you dont wanna be learning the hard way and end up with bills that make you wanna cry

why did i do this

for the thrills babes it felt like a free trip to the theme park first medical stuff has always felt cool to me hence the career i chose second i was just really immature immature young adults do immature things some people speed down the highway thinking theyre in fast  furious i was over here getting my kicks from playing patient

did they ever catch on

i really doubt it now that im a nurse with some miles on me i honestly dont think i could spot someone pulling the stunts i did sure ive seen patients try to pull one over on us but its not always black and white sometimes its super obvious and other times its just a little sus most of the time we give our patients the benefit of the doubt because they dont have a reason to lie i was never overly dramatic and i never wanted way too much treatment i dont think they suspected anything from me

the real fd alarms go off when the patients a frequent flier in the hospital with no clear diagnosis or when someones a regular in the er that all the staff recognize thats not how i did it i made sure never to overplay my hand never got too familiar with any one er the one time they wanted to admit me i refused that felt like the opposite of what someone with fd would do

i think way more people with fd are probably flying under the radar because theyre not going full soap opera with their symptoms

what changed

i grew up working in a hospital and seeing how insanely busy everyone is was a real eyeopener i already knew it was hectic but i didnt truly get it until i worked on the other side i saw nurses barely having time for a bathroom break i understood my behavior was causing real harm and stopped

i dont think its any deeper than that

i know everyone loves a good backstory like some deeprooted trauma that was the root cause of my antics i dont think my case was like that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar like freud said for me it was just a weird phase an immature hobby that i outgrew thats it i wasnt trying to fill some emotional void or anything

one more thing i barely have enough free time to watch my favorite shows anymore let alone indulge in any other hobbies back then i had way too much free time and you know what they say about idle hands

did i ever get treatment for fd

no when i was doing this i didnt want to stop or get help when i stopped i didnt get treatment because i didnt think id need it anymore and now that ive got my stuff together i dont want factitious disorder stamped on my medical records if it ever happens again i will get help but it wont happen again

with fd its not like youre delusional you know youre faking it i managed to leave it in the past but if it ever makes a comeback ill be getting a therapy session booked asap

pro tip for my fellow health pros

we could totally notice more patients with fd if we kept an eye out for the red flags if someones only sick on weekends and holidays you should notice that pattern and i think we should pay more attention to medical records a little detective work might not just spot fd but also catch a bunch of other shady stuff going on
so im  and extrovert i like to make friends and hangout with people my parents being bit of orthodox they wanted to know that whom im hanging out and im not doing anything wrong so earlier i used to tell them that i met this girl from college or i met few guys on ground and we are good buddies  something like that so my parents didnt allow much in the earlier days telling me to focus on studies later on i realised that if i didnt lie to parents ill miss fun in college life or i cannot hangout with friends 
so today even like after  yrs passing from college sometimes that feeling gives me bit of guilt that i used to lie to my parents just to hangout now if i come across some situation where ive to lie i apologise to them in my mind only and proceed for that thing it doesnt make much impact but just let me feel bit lighter
im in jhs and i was browsing on the shelves in the stem section one day because i wanted to do research purposes related to it since its my top  strand for marine biology

i stumbled upon two interesting books that caught my attention they were just silly fun facts about animals and biology but i enjoyed reading them 

so i searched them up online in hopes i could buy and afford a copy but i was way out of budget and they only had  in stock

i acted on my impulsive thoughts instead of borrowing them i was reading on a corner surrounded by bookshelves with no witnesses and cctv cameras

i stuffed the two books inside my messenger bag cautiously before leaving the school grounds immediately for context i did not skip it was dismissal time already and im a commuter

months have passed by and the books are still in my possession just chilling on top of my study table knowing that it has my schools logo stamped on the back 

i do feel a sense of guilt every time i read them all over again the sy is near to an end and im honestly surprised that i havent been caught just yet 

when i was  years old we had a male cat that marked his territory everywhere by the time i realized he did it my book bag it was too late i was already in class and that potent cloying smell filled the classroom some of my classmates assumed it was the weird girl they didnt like and picked on her mercilessly while i sat there and said nothing i was a child but i still feel terrible  years later 
i was out to dinner with my friends and one of them asked for an adderall i keep it in my car so i excused myself and went out to the parking lot id already been drinking as wed gone to the winery first and i was still having wine i get in the car open the bottle to get one and spilled them everywhere including on the asphalt the car door was open cause i expected to quickly be in and out
the parking lot has no lights so i decided to turn my car on and back up a little then use the headlights to find the pills my phone was inside and i was drunk so this made sense to me at the time  i put the car in park found out very quickly i actually left it in neutral and then got on the ground to look for pills car started rolling back and i get up to chase after it  it looked like a scene from mr beans holiday i get around the door and manage to put one foot in im trying to stomp on the break when i somehow tumble out the car and end up underneath it my  pound suv rolled over the back of my left leg i was so drunk i hadnt even processed what just happened and i got back up to keep chasing after it it slowly backed into another vehicle and finally stopped 

nobody was outside or saw me i drove to a different parking spot and went inside and told my friends we need to get the check they said i looked disheveled and asked me what happened i said someone hit me with their car and they demanded security footage and to find out who did this to you luckily there is none and they dont know that im both the victim and main suspect in my own hit and run 

before you ask yes the next day i went to the er to get checked out no broken bones but i did get a bad muscle injury so doctor monitored my cpk levels which were double what they should be and he also thinks i should press charges on whoever ran me over  
first post for a new person trying to figure out how to do this right so i thought i would start with a confession when i was a kid i lied about my eyes being a mess because i wanted glasses so i could look like harry potter now my eyes are a wreak lol

edit jesus people i was wrong about the glasses causing my bad eyesight and assumed it was that and not my families bad genetics when it comes to eyesight i didnt know  that doesnt make me a liar if i wanted to lie i would come up with something interesting i only joined this website because my brother said it is fun
once in primary school i was very interested in koalas and also wanted to do a good deed for the year i started a fundraiser to support koalas i went up to the children in my year with a donation bucket and on the front it had a sad koala that my teacher had helped me print off i asked the children in my year for a small donation to help save the koalas from deforestation i tried all recess and only came up with  so i decided to spend the money at the canteen and buy  sausage rolls instead i still think about this every now and then 

tldr didnt raise enough money for the koalas so i spent the money on sausage rolls

i  lied about being colorblind it began in elementary where i told all my friends and began hinting towards my parents i began doing extensive research on certain types of colorblindness and their commonness i chose the most common type a red green colorblind type i learned exactly how they saw and began to even be able to picture what each shade would look like in colorblind vision as i grew old enough to realize these lies werent exactly okay i had already had everyone around my finger i was too deep into this lie soon after i was gifted colorblind glasses by family as the years went by i found an amazing boyfriend who ive been with for  years now and were planning to marry soon he and his family believes i am colorblind everyone in my life believes i am colorblind i cannot tell a single soul nobody knows
i cant remember how old i was but probably between  years old my mom was on sick leave because she had been burnt out it was me my older sister and my mom at home we were all watching tv kinda crammed up in our small couch my mom was laying on her side and me and my sister were sitting next to each other i looked at my mom and asked her if she wasnt wearing makeup she said no and i regretfully remember that i thought i was being funny when i replied with you look so ugly i also remember with horror that my mom started crying she wasnt mad she didnt say anything she just cried silently i looked at my sister and she kind of shook her head at me as if saying no you cant say that this is the worst memory of my life i hate myself every time it comes to mind i wish i could erase this from my memory 

context when i was a kid i was very shy and sometimes didnt speak to people at all i kind of struggled around people and just how to fit inact normal i was a good kid but i had a lot of anxiety at a very early age and was also very sensitive i would say or do things that i picked up from my piers because i thought that was normal or even cool then i would get in trouble and people were disappointed in me and i would feel really bad why could i never get things right is there something wrong with me i just struggled a lot with how to be a human 

i dont know if my lacking behavior skills had anything to do with why i called my mom ugly but no matter the reason i hope i can forgive myself one day it is my deepest regret and a dark memory that i have never shared with anyone
i studied in a private school during third grade primary i dont remember it very clearly but my parents always mentions and laughs about it im pretty sure its because the kid was acting very annoying on my desk while i was talking to someone else i then proceeded to punch him  times which resulted in my parents getting called i never fought anyone unless they were being very annoying in the end my parents just took as a joke i was then forced to apologise i dont remember the persons name or face but im pretty sure he switched his classroom after this  or  girls apparently had a crush on me after they saw it live action this has always made me smile in some way i feel completely bad for the person after so long wondered if he ever forgave me for the  hit combo 
 years ago i was an annoying little nd grader my rd grade teacher mrs f was a really sweet teacher she had pencils that smelled of fruit on her desk one day noone was looking and i put them in my backpack she didnt realize they were missing if she did she didnt say anything a little letter i took a cinnamon scented pencil this was a not so cheat pencil she confronted the whole class about it but i never got in trouble me and my mean girl friends blamed my arch enemy 

spellings fixed a holes 
i had all the makings of a little kleptomaniac but thankfully i grew out of it

i would steal small toys or jewelry when i was over at friends houses i would steal little things from students in my classroom like their fun erasers any little toys they would bring or other small items like crafting supplies or mementoes i even stole an apple shaped eraser from a book fair i remember taking a pendant from a friend that had pressed flowers in it i remember taking a popper toy from a student in my classroom and the teacher even had this student make an announcement in front of the class about it missing to see if anyone has found it i had it in my possession when that announcement was made

i dont know why i did it it wasnt even really because i wanted the items it was mostly because i just wanted to perform the act of taking the items 

as i said i grew out of it this all happened probably under the age of  not sure why i had to do it but i guess im glad the compulsion didnt persist or turn into something worse 
this kid was so irritating he kept trying to touch me and he made some rude ass comments so i stabbed him with a pen and i just remembered today i dont feel bad tho it was low key out of the blue cause i never warned him i was gonna before i did it he well deserved punishment tbh i didnt realize how much more violent i used to be tho
i go to panda express once a month and take about a month worth of their plastic forks every time i dont know why i do this but i guess i just dont want to do dishes
so i went to a store yesterday and picked up some peanuts to eat  as i had seen many people do the samebut this time the store workers came shouting and told me to pay for g worth of peanuts and i said okbut after that one female shopper kept on shouting at me and i as i dont know russian i didnt understand her or the shopkeepersi just bought the stuff i intended to buy paid for all even g of peanuts and left
what should i do after this  should i go back to the store in future 
it is the nearest store to my house
id never really had depression until i became an adult but it got bad fast at  i went through an abusive relationship and my partner drugged me with some botched acid tabs which sent me into psychedelic psychosis for several months and my depression became much worse some of the effects seem to be permanent such as loss of memory and brain function i really miss how smart i used to be  after that i was sad and some repressed memories of being sad in high school came up too so i kinda dealt with both of them at once all my friends moved away so i had to live with people i didnt know or trust during college and the living conditions ended up being very chaotic and dangerous none of my family lived near me i was in college studying a difficult degree i had no interest in it just sounded practical when i wasnt home i was working long hours in an extremely toxic work environment that i wont even go into but tldr the place shouldve been shut down for many reasons such as labor law violations sexual harassment understaffing yada yada yada 
the stress eventually gave me stomach ulcers which made me feel sick or in pain  unable to eat which caused fatigue and rapid weight loss and obviously worse depression the symptoms always got worse after i experienced high stress so when i was stressed i was also in great pain and discomfort which caused more stress and it was just a hellish cycle no treatments worked and doctors told me it wouldnt get better unless i got my stress under control mountains of medical bills just to inevitably get that advice started self harming everyday instead 

i got to that point of depression where you just lose interest in everything even the things you once adored i started half assing everything in my life because i didnt have passion anymore and tbh thought id kill myself soon anyways my best friend of  years got engaged and i was the maid of honor my absolute dream but i barely thought about it barely put any effort into the bachelorette party during the huge wedding only  people did speeches and i was one of them i wrote the speech the day before and it sucked i made one joke and made cliche generalisations about the bride and groom being perfect for each other 

my mom lived a couple hours away and completed what was basically a beginners triathlon  but she was almost  years old it was a huge event and the whole family attended except me i was a wage slave who couldnt get that weekend off from my shitty job so i didnt show up i barely ever called my parents and put no interest into my relationship with them even though theyre amazing parents same with my brother and sister i missed my brothers military graduation for the same dumb reason my siblings have always been huge role models and supporters to me and i barely reached out to them during all of college im crying just typing this 

this is how i treated every friendship and family member during those times after years of therapy and self healing my head is finally clear and i feel like my actual self again i cant believe it 

if i could go back in time id absolutely spoil my best friend throughout her whole engagement write the most passionate wedding speech to celebrate her and her husbands achievements and love include some stories id quit my job just so i could attend every family members event and talk to them everyday id treat every friendship with passion and speak my mind instead of withdrawing 

ive never told my family about anything i went through partly because of shame but mostly because it would devastate them and i cant bear to do that but as a result it feels like they dont understand me anymore and ive felt like the odd one out for a while theyre very close to each other but when im with them i feel so out of place like im just kindathere now i get such bad anxiety when im with them its painful just to be around them 

i hate the person ive been since i became an adult im so grateful to be better now and im committed to being a better person people around me have noticed the difference but i grieve the once in a lifetime moments with my loved ones that i wasted because of my shitty mental state i barely remember those times now because i was so out of it during 

anyone else struggle with forgiving themselves for the way they acted when they were low 
back in the day when me and my husband just married i was looking for a patio set i went to a big box store and found a set on clearance as it was end of season and open box i asked if they could hold it for me as i needed my husband to be off work so he could pick it up in his truck they said no so i asked if i could make multiple trips and the inside store associate said yes so i grabbed the  big clearance sign and went off to pay

i went to customer service to pay the person was on the phone i placed the sign on the counter in front of them they walked to a different part of the customer service desk i followed them and stood in front of them they moved back to where they were originally standing i followed them there and crickets i just wasnt acknowledged by the customer service person they looked at me and then avoided me

as i was standing there still waiting to pay the inside store associate said lets load it up i thought fk it and would go pay when they asked for the bill well as they were loading up my car i saw my mil there and we loaded her car we drove to her house to drop it off as she lived close to the store then i drove back and picked up the rest of it and they helped me load that up as well 

not once was i asked if i paid for it i truly did try but got irritated the cs person didnt even want to speak to me that is how i got my patio set many a year ago it is older than my child and it should be replaced but it didnt cost me anything so i am not letting it go till it truly gets gross then i will save it for my dog so they have a place to lay on it in the summer 
i work at a corporate restaurant and we have these little tablets that sit on our tables were supposed to ask for people to take surveys on them to get more shifts and i never do i just catch it before it goes out and take it myself im one of the top rated servers nobody knows dw i make sure i serve everyone well
like i said this is a really stupid one when i was in preschool my mom took us to a grocery store to get a snack and some other things i was going to get these fruit roll things but when i picked one up i opened it immediately this isnt really all that bad i just put it away and took a different one that i didnt open but i felt really bad about it at the time
edit  thank you everyone for your honest responses i have decided that im going to keep doing that since both parties benefit from it 

i became rich by selling characters for more then i bought them for

for any people unaware what characters i am talking about  there is a culture in art community of drawing images of creatures that you made up and later selling them which is called an adopt 

so how exactly did i become rich i am from a relatively poor country with dogwater of a currency where  usd could feed you well for a week therefore there are a lot of people selling high quality pieces that they spent  hours working on for measly  dollar or so 

however in international spaces due to the inflation of usd the price for even the lowest quality adopts from noname artists varies between  usd for relatively popular ones it only goes up

so as you might have guessed i just buy those hq characters for cents and then resell them for what would be considered big money in my country and even if i were selling them for lowbal in the us i would still be making profit either way

usually there are tos to characters like dont sell for more than bought unless spent money on art notify about the new owner and etc i avoid those because i dont care for those characters besides reselling them for more than i bought them for 

i really feel sorry for those designers as they most likely could get a lot of money if they just learnt english and made a toyhouseychcometc account but capitalism is a game with survival of the fittest 
i remember a time an acquaintance of mine was in pre school with me and we were like  and he had a stuffed animal i liked and i had it and he had said it was his which it was anyways long story short i ended up with the bunny and named him goodnight and i feel bad for lying to this day as it randomly pops in my head idky i remember it so vividly but i do 

i live a normal life mid thirties engaged one dog no kids i did lines first thing in the morning in the bathroom at work in the bathroom at home in my car wherever i assume i hid it very well i stopped when the person i got it from moved out of state its been about  months since then and i am very scared that most i likely fucked up my brain chemistry of course i wish i never did this 

edit thank you for all the encouraging words everyone thank you for sharing your experiences with me and for the advice and well wishes i get it now people noticed something but i was never questioned so in my mind i thought i was hiding it super well but im wrong after reading your comments its very likely people knew something was going on its a horrible feeling but its the truth anyway thanks again 
im already paying so much for groceries 
when i was a kid i usually would go aroundfind a snail and than step on them not letting any of them livei did this for two reasonsit was fun i thought these disgusting parasites were creations of the devil himself and the snails were his personal guards and warriorsdamn i was a weird girl back then
i the rd world country i was born public sanitation facilities were a rarity  the ones available had a miserable unbearable stench and filth due to lack of enough cleaning
so had to release in public buses parked at depots 
just go to the back of the empty bus and do the pee 

when i was  years old my teacher left his usb on the table while leaving class and i secretly took it i hated my teacher then i went home and plugged the usb into my computer my plan was to put a porn video inside the usb when the teacher came to the classroom i was going to leave the uso on the table and he would plug the usb to the smart board and he would see that video and open it the whole class would watch that video but at the last moment i gave up doing this and gave the usb back to the teacher normally i may have made mistakes while typing my english is not very good
yes i know i was stupid little you dont need to write a comment
yea soooo around this time last year i had exams in a week i hadnt studied at all and my parents are stupid strict about getting good grades anyways i decided the only way out was to get injured i did goddam research on way to break your hand and finally decided to take a dumbell weight and bring down on my right wrist a few times
well it worked and i got out the exam and thankfully my dumbass choice didnt cause permanent damage i had a cast on for a month i remember this today cause its been almost exactly a year and today i was pushing my door open and my wrist starting stinging
also doc gave me a small scare of me needing surgery at the time luckily didnt need for it as the damage wasnt that bad but he was suspicious of me
my cover story was i slipped in my room and my hand hit the corner of my desk
man that was an extremely stupid thing to do thankfully nothing worse happened so yea dont do what i did kids
study
i work from home and lately i have been spending most of my day generating inappropriate nsfw ai images and trying to find random guys to show them off to and see if they can tell if they are real or not and see if they are turned on by them  im not sure why i enjoy it so much but when someone else gets turned on by them it really turns me on and i feel i might have an unhealthy addiction to this honestly im even posting this hoping some guys will see and message wanting to see some   my thoughts are consumed by this idea and i cant concentrate on real life stuff  
i am currently in my senior year of highschool and over the summer i rented a trombone from the school band director in hopes that i would join band this year i never ended up turning in the paperwork after i got the trombone and switched out of the band class before classes began so now its been  of the school year and have a trombone hidden in the back of my closet i feel super guilty for never giving the trombone back and i have horrible anxiety when it comes to confrontation im so nervous that im to deep into this and it would be better to just pretend i never rented it in the first place 
i hate confrontation and dont want to disappoint anyone because i waited till the end of the year
title says it all but since that time i have learned how to make pastry from scratch instead of buying it almost all storebought pastry dough contains lard  it was for an event and i didnt have time to figure out something else  i felt horrible all night watching the kosher guests defile themselves with the little quiches id made
bible says you shouldnt curse people and i think in a metaphorical sense its just wishing wrong on anybody even if it would balance out what they put into the equation of their own life

something feels deeply broken in my life but i shouldnt author texts or tell people so many twisted statements about how the world ought have more of what its been getting  i may have lost my care of what happens but broadcasting it is not the way  i shouldnt curse people  

i should do my part to contribute instead  i simply feel like old paths were ripped from out beneath me and ive been rebuilding  i feel far behind in life and its beyond jealousy of peers i just want stability and authenticity in what i do and for there to be reward in life for innovation individuals can manage so we can all be a little more relaxed and artful about how we live

i deeply want to get back to positivity  there are so many things to be positive for  i just feel ashamed for some of things ive said  i think they were if conveyed in person clearly intended to suggest a mockery of what has gone on  some of my statements i do sincerely believe but the way i expressed everything was well over the top too much and needlessly without civility of expressing some really twisted ideas  there might be legitimate claims in what i said but what i said was in passionate fiery anger for feeling so repeatedly screwed over the last  months

ive been given so much already this is a period of having less for me  i am gonna just smile try to think friendlier thoughts be at ease think more before speaking or writing

were talking a guy who left me without desperately needed k during holidays without diligent apology and to repay  a woman who wanted my kids also took money from me because she had me sign on a lease for her that i didnt want  she then said some foul things against me and i had to leave

and this is sad and all but not worth the things i said  i do keep getting screwed but i just have to keep holding out there is gonna be a job for me here soon  i am gonna do more internal work first before externalizing garbage from my mouth and in things i communicate

couldnt be more sorry  apologies 

in my freshman year of high school people would put a pencil in their locker when they didnt want to put the combination in so often i used to open peoples lockers and take food homework or even just random things like pencils just so somebody would be sad one day i took a students cell phone and hid it all the way across the school mind you i went to a big ass school and he never found it i feel so bad because if my phone was stolen from my locker id be incredibly distraught but the fact that i got away with it fuels me sometimes 
when i was young i did the deed with a girl in her church during mass and the entire time i was asking god to forgive me for what i was doing after her family dropped me off home i went to my room and prayed to jesus asking for forgiveness i know people have done it in public areas or even school but a churchi feel horrible and icky when i think bout it


update omg i wasnt expecting people to actually relate or even tell me it was okay yall made me day istg another thing id like to add was during mass the choir was singing so of course they wouldnt hear the teens going at it during jesus hours 
 i signed up for classes and my parents have been
 paying for them for the last two semesters they think ive been going to my classes and getting decent grades due to me lying whenever they ask about it and making them believe in a completely false reality

 i have withdrawn from every class the last two semesters with no refund and their money has gone completely down the drain because of me my parents wouldve been more understanding if i was honest from the beginning but now i feel like im in too deep

 i know this all is pathetic but i just want to take the easy route and run away and lose contact i dont know why i cant bring myself to talk to my parents i dont know what to do 

i legitimately dont have any excuses for myself and my behavior i cant put any blame on anxiety or depression ive been feeling pretty well for the past year of pushing guilt aside and only caring about shortterm happiness 

its not even the first time ive done this when i first went to college when i was  i also failed some classes one semester and a year later i failed all my classes they found out those times and did what they could to help which included some very expensive therapy however this is the third time ive done this and the third time i was dishonest to my parents and i believe its unforgivable 

i know i need to come clean about this but i want to take an easy way out again i want to start using harder drugs so i at least have some sort of reason for being terrible i dont know what to do 

edit

thank you for all of your comments it was hard to stomach reading most of them and to come to terms with the shame ive been feeling hearing your guys advice was extremely helpful and gave me a lot of courage to finally call my mom and come clean to her about all the lying and the betraying ive done to her i think things are going to be okay i know it will take a long time to deserve her forgiveness and trust again but i am hopeful i can change my plan now is to go back home for a bit work and then try to enlist in the military to learn discipline and have gratitude for all that i have been given i know i will spend a long time feeling terribly guilty and an equally long time trying to make it up to my parents 
i got hooked on cigarettes this way and i am ashamed and had to confess this
ohh  i was just bad during those times took  from my dad and when he came to the school to get it from me i gave it away to some random kid in the bathroom cause i thought it was save me from the troubles but anyway i felt justified cause we were in the bathroom and he was just flexing his legos and wouldnt let me touch them but talk how mighty they are like we were kids i was letting him play with my bakugans and you turn around and do this to me so i waited from him to leave the bathroom and watch him put it in his locker then walk to his class i then walked out straight towards his locker opened it saw it sitting on the base of the locker grabbed then closed it broo why is his class a straight shot view of the lockers he literally saw me then saw him he raised his hands and i can see him mouthing what just happened i jetted diagonally to my class and threw them away lol if all went to plan i wouldve kept them but after they came to my class and didnt find them on me i was to scared to reach in the trash for them and by then too much trash was on it that was our last interaction i can remember lol
i lied a lot as a kid my father died when i was young and my mother albeit mentally unwell was quite chaste and honest we were very poor so i misbehaved and then lied about it i stole money from her from our housekeeper more like an ihss worker and influenced my best friend to steal from her mother then got caught i once changed prices on an item in a store and the clerk discovered it and my mother was not a happy camper i had an old radio with bulbs so i put my thermometer on one and conjured up a fever to get out of school she was nurse i wrote about it in a diary that had no lock on it she read it and believed that i wrote it because i knew shed read it she was naive

i stole cigarettes from my aunts who smoked at the time a little piece of jewelry from my cousin that im not sure she even knew was missing i stole pills from my cousins medicine cabinet and shared them with my friends i stole clothes from stores and of course my girlfriends all gave it to me i even lied to my girlfriends that i had my period a year before i actually did

although this is something i grew out of and had an old boyfriend who was a pathological fabricator my life is so fantastical i have no need to make stuff up anymore i cannot stand a liar i dont steal since then but do feel guilty when i walk through a store and feel like i want to take something and the guards eyeball me like they know
when i was between  years old we had a housemaid that used to bother me so i used to put a tiny bit of cleaning disinfectant in her empty water cup thinking shed fill the cup up with water and drink it without noticing 

one time she told my parents that her stomach hurt and that she drank the disinfectant im assuming she saw me put it in or something and they told me to stop doing that because i could go to prison so i just stopped 

just wanted to tell someone 

when i was around  my neighbour who was around  was outside either on the trampoline or with her dogs and i went inside to get water i went in her room because i wanted to check around it and i saw it sitting on her desk my child eyes sparkled i had never had a push pop before or even thought of having one but i saw so many people eating them and i wanted one too i picked it up off her desk and tasted it and like i loved it so i put it in my pocket i immediately felt guilty went and got water i drank it went outside and said i had to go home i jumped the fence back into my yard and went home story is pretty anticlimatic ive never told anyone before because of how guilty i felt i still feel guilty to this day i saw her again the next day and she complained how her brother stole her push pop i had already eaten it yeah thats the whole story even if i wanted to tell her i could weve lost contact with each other

im m five years ago our house maid got kicked out because of me and i regret it  
one day i came back from school  with couple of my friends then we decided to rent a ps for that day so i needed some money my dad wasnt home and my mother was sleeping so i looked under one of the carpets and found some money my mom kept it there it was more than i needed but said lets just take it and buy some extra stuff with it and was planning on telling mom when i get back so when i finished playing i went back home and found my mom yelling at the maid and when i realised it was about the money i couldnt say it was me because she wouldve killed mebc why didnt you tell me before i yelled at the poor maid so she kicked her out the maid really needed that job and her family too  now after five years i still visit her family and bring them food to help them and havent told anyone yet

edit  
i shouldve clarified that my mom never told anyonelike putting shes a thief or something on her file she got a new job and im still a friend with their family and always trying to help them and everybody moved on and forgot about it so i dont think telling my mom is gonna change anything am i right or what idk anymore

another edit  
the money wasnt that much its like  my mom didnt kick her out because of the amount she dosent care about it its about the concept of steeling i think she put it under the carpet for special use because she dosent usually keep cash

another one  
one of the reasons for still not telling anyone is that before the pandemic i used to to be a bad student and stuff but since then i changed my life in every section and my family is finally proud and i think by saying this story its gonna bring me back





more context  
thnx everybody for your opinions but im gonna give more context  
first of all im not an american if u cant see it from my english  so where am from having a maid doesnt mean necessarily that ure rich or something so im not some rich boy i live a normal life 

and about the money and the amount some ppl said i probably faked the amount and what i did with it like buying drugs or something i converted the amount to dollars from my local currency thats why its sound small and drugs and drinking isnt that popular in my region so no i did not buy drugs i rented a ps and yes we do rent them here

and for ppl who said my mom shouldnt go the maid directly for the money is because the maid used to take foods and some clothes without telling us but never money or something like that my mother never told her anything bc she  obviously needed so ok 

when the maid left us she just went for another family like nothing happened 
i know it doesnt sounds as much but i think i did really bad in short during last years summer break my best friend renewed contact with his old friend and started to act really mean towards me even though i asked him to stop i started to tell my other  friends about his behaviour not to make him look bad in front of them they also are friends with him but because these were the only people that would help me to calm down or let me know how to act in this situation

fast forward to back to school and my best friend found out i talked about him of course he was mad and i cried and begged him to forgive me because i was really emotional back then and i didnt want to lose my first real best friend he forgave me i think but he started to slowly drift apart from me talking to one of the friends more spending more time with her and sometimes even ignoring me he also started to talk with one person from our class that was really shitty towards us some time ago also he still is mean to me i try to talk to my i guess now friend everyday how i used to but he finds ways to taunt me or simply be mean to me without apparent reason i apologized to him a lot of times for things i ever said and i did let him know that im really not doing it anymore and it was a way for me to cope back then and im different now it seems like he gets it and were able to joke around and talk normally but he really did prefer to talk with anyone other than me and i dont know if ill ever get a second chance

though he accepted my invite to go eat something out the two of us like we used to so i really hope we can revive this friendship if hell be engaged enough in it
when i was  i was walking home from a birthday party it was a few houses down from my own and decided that i did not want the good times to end in a whim i walked to my friends house instead and told her my parents said we could have a sleepover when we got to my house i told my dad that my mom had given the ok for the sleepover and a few hours later when my mom came home i told her that my dad had said it was alright

we watched finding nemo and ate cantaloupe on the floor of my livingroom and the whole night i was dreading the morning expecting to get in trouble once my friend left

i never did get in trouble and to my knowledge neither of them ever found out im sorry mom and dad  
my principal took five bucks from me when i was in fourth grade he took it because some dumb rich girl had lost   
the  her parents gave her every day to buy st at the school store at the school store and my mom accidentally gave me  for the school store that day and he thought that i had took it  
since that moment on ive stole from the school store at every opportunity i could because i was never my money   
back i became judge jury and executioner and i have no  pity for the erasers i took   
i only stopped senior  year because i was worried that me being  and getting caught could result in me goint to  
jail idk im just paranoid like that
so basically i have friends whom ive been with for  years i transfered school and tried to lay low for a moment since i really hate interacting but when groupings i really struggle so i tried to associate with certain individuals in order to get by and also not to gain attention and here is where the lying begins not to be proud of but i have a talent for lying since i have strict parents moving on to the story so they asked me about my life and at first i was avoiding the question but they just kept on pestering me occasionally so i came up with the idea to lie so whenever im with my original friend i act normal but when im with the new friend i act differently now i dont know who tf am


i m have resorted to buying valium online to get by in all social settings on one hand im ashamed and on the other it allows me live a normal life even though i only take one mg tablet a day i realise im an addict and to some extent at the mercy of this benzo boost 
when i check my lotto scratchers i typically do it on my phone with the lotto appif i win i just send the  to my account of course this renders what is otherwise an outwardly winning ticket invalid due to having been redeemed

i typically keep these winners in the visor of my car i live in hampton va for those who dont know you can barely stop at a red light in the springsummer without having some mouthbreathing on your window asking for cashso what i do is pull one of these winners out of my visor and hand it to them while saying sorry i dont have cash on me but theres a few bucks on this ticket

in hindsight sight i can only imagine the second and third order of effect this has when somebody who is typically drunk on drugs or has a mental illness tries to cash out the ticket at the  and is told its no longer valid

disclaimer i do try to help those who i think are genuinely in need i just dont like being stared down or hassled when all im trying to do is drive down the street
this is something i feel a lot of guilt over  when i was  i joined an online twitch community for a streamer  they had around  people regularly around in the community  these people ranged from age  with most being around   after a few months i had a falling out with the streamer whos community it was but since i had spent a lot of time there i felt like friends with a lot of the community members  i started to talk to a handful of them afterwards  one of them was someone who was   i think they had lied about being  but told me at one point they were turning  soon

i was  at this point and i didnt see it as a big deal  we bonded over being the only people interested in american sports  nfl mlb nba  we would send each other memes talk about sports games banter each others teams

the darker side was a few times i would talk about my problems  the drama within the community how it was affecting me my depression and i think at one point i even alluded to not wanting to live anymore  these are heavy topics to share with anybody but in the context of a  year old adult sharing this with a random  year old online i feel it was extremely inappropriate and i feel guilty for any effect my actions may have had on him  we havent talked in years i dont plan to  i thought about reaching out and apologizing but i figure its best i move on and leave him be  i can only hope my behavior didnt leave a lasting impact on his life
i got my drivers license when i was  years old i was never allowed to touch my mothers car because it was pretty expensive and fairly new when my parents left to go on their wedding anniversary my mother repeatedly told me not to touch her car i did anyway i decided to skip the bus and drive my mothers car to school school was only about  minutes away so i didnt think shed notice a difference in the gas when i got there so many people crowded around me asking when did you get a porsche wanting to sit in the drivers seat calling me cool and all i thought i was the coolest kid after school was over my friend asked if i could drive her home to which i agreed her home was about  mins away and required me getting on the highway on my way home from dropping her off i was going about  mph when i lost control of the car and hit the barrier i was completely fine with just a few scratches and a little bit of pain from the airbag but nothing concerning my moms car on the other hand was completely totaled the only thing i could think of was pretending to feel way worse than i actually was so i could avoid being disciplined i called for an ambulance and told them i had severe chest and head pain and i even went as far as to pretended i didnt remember the date and my name my parents were contacted by the hospital and had to leave their vacation to come to the hospital while i was there they did a ct scan and found nothing they did a few other checks that i dont know the names of but eventually i was cleared to go home we had to take an uber and on the way back my mother couldnt stop crying about how she could have lost me a couple weeks later i overheard my parents talking that they had gotten my medical bill and it was over k my mother also had to purchase a new car on top of that and it had left them with little to no money my parents ended up having to rent out a room to hopefully make up the money to pay my bills i was a stupid kid and i think about how i ruined everything that day im now way older and have been paying them back the money in increments and when im done i plan on confessing for what i did 
when i was  i got really drunk and rizzed up some females then stole a computer from a bar
i f have been faking seizures for the past  weeks it stared one day when i decided to fake passing out because i wanted attention from my best friend as i felt we  were drifting and apparently this is all i could think of i passed out for long enough that she called  and by the time i realised the paramedics had arrived after this seizures were brought up by the hospital and i figured hey i have to keep this consistent i kept faking these to get out of things i didnt want to do including in school this gave me the ability to move to classes with people i knew and get a free pass to my schools sensory rooms to reduce stress i kept gaining from this and all i had to do was flop for a bit recently i was too tired to flop for long enough to get out of lesson so i simply said that my legs werent working  from there it progressed to faking repeated temporary partial paralysis its gotten me the attention ive been craving but im fed up of all the medical tests theyve been putting me through to find an explanation

i understand that what ive done is terrible and i now bear immense guilt for everything ive put my friends and family through none of them know im faking and i dont know where to go from here  


edit to add ive stopped still no further on the therapy situation so stop screaming at me abt it im going to work through as much of my mental shit as i can whether i end up in a psych ward or not to those who have reached out with kind reassuring words that i can change that this is my first step that this isnt me or has just been soft with their words in general i thank you your probably the reason im here to those telling me i need to be institutionalised that im an asshole wackass childish i say im  this is not an excuse and most of the stuff your telling me i already know 
sorry for my bad grammar i got help from google translate 

in august  i was living in a small village in anatolia we were building a long concrete wall around our house in our village for this reason we worked with someone who is good in this field me my brother my father and that man we worked from morning to evening for  weeks at the beginning of the second week my mother had prepared lunch and we took a break from work the man had his own vw polo and it was very dirty inside my mother invited us to dinner we went too i was stealing a lot at that time the man was parking his car in our garage and there were only tractors and agricultural machinery in the garage before dinner i went to get my headphones that i had forgotten in the tractor the night before i saw the mans car as i was getting out after picking it up there was a phone in the passenger seat and someone was calling i didnt care then i went to dinner and saw the man talking on another phone the man had  phones after eating we drank tea and went back to work i was used to stealing because i was stealing a lot at that time i was doing it for my own benefit under the pretext of going to the toilet i went to the mans car and took his phone i took it home i went to my room and formatted it because it had a password then i removed the sim card and smashed it i threw the phone into my bag that i use for school i had my books in it and i thought no one would suspect it the man realized that he lost his phone  days later and could not find it he said that he was scolded by his wife were finally done the wall was completed and the man was gone i never saw the man again after that school started in september and i was staying with my other brother he had his own workshop the rest of my family was farming in the village during the first week of school i advertised the phone on a website and found a customer in  days i sold the phone for around  tl  usd i used the money as my own pocket money and nothing bad happened to me
this happened in my art class my teacher was telling some of my classmates that she just changed their grades after a test one of them said he wanted to see he grade now and he went over to the teachers desk and looked off her computer  others followed him and i followed as well she told us to come away from her desk and not look off her computer because its not appropriate as my classmates walked away from her desk i stayed and made sure they werent looking then i closed her laptop about a minute later she noticed her laptop was closed and asked the  who closed it they were all confused and said they didnt close it she said one of you guys had to have done it the computer didnt close itself they all just claimed they didnt do it and then she said well whoever did that it wasnt okay she went back to her computer and started working

the funny thing is one of my classmates saw me do it but he didnt say anything and second i was over there too but she didnt even ask me if i closed it just those  people
i had chronic nosebleeds as a kid especially in the winter i was also an avid reader and i would check books out from the library in my hometown all the time

it was a copy of the first hunger games book i remember that clearly i was reading it in bed and got a nosebleed all of a sudden and dripped blood all over the pages of the book i panicked because i didnt want my parents to make me use my allowance to pay to replace the book so as soon as i got the bleeding under control i just kinda closed the book and hoped nobody would notice i put the book back in the return slot the next week and never heard anything else about it

i realize now that that was a biohazard and i shouldnt have done it but considering i live in canada now theres not much else to be done at this point

so uh if you were a librarian in wisconsin in the s and found a copy of the hunger games with blood all over two pages sorry that was me
hi i am a teenager and i lost my moms pure saudi gold earrings at school not a while ago i decided to wear my moms earrings that she let me borrow to school and i did something stupid that may have triggered the earring to become loose however i didnt notice until i felt that one of my ears felt lighter and at that moment my stomach absolutely sunk to find out that the earring was gone i cried and panicked i grabbed a few friends and we looked everywhere for hours yet we found nothing i also filed a report to the guidance council office janitors and security guards but i have absolutely no hope left even though my mom has many expensive jewelry already im still very regretful and sick to my stomach 

one thing that i know now is to never trust myself with expensive jewelry and to only stick to simple accessories regardless of the occasion 

the only option that i have left is to confess to my mom about the earring but i dont know how i know that i cant expect much and that she will most likely lash out on me but my anxiety has gotten so bad and i have so much problems already i really need to let go please help 


my sister has always been critical of me when i was younger i was so desperate to earn her approval that i constantly kept track of where it was so i could read what she was writing about me it usually wasnt all that nice and thinking about it she probably only wrote in it as a vent but every time i saw what she had written about me i would use it to try to change myself so that shed like me better

i got to the point where i couldnt not read it even though i grew more and more ashamed of it the older i got if you happen to see this and realize its us im sorry i never shouldve violated your privacy like that this happened even after i turned  as we were both still living in the same house as our parents

i now know a lot of secrets i shouldnt and feel bad every time i think about it and how she thinks of me i wish i had never done this and im pretty sure it only served to weaken and hurt our relationship rather than strengthen it as had been my intent i want to unread all that ive read but i cant
i dont remember exactly when i first started it had to be around th grade it was seen as cool to shoplift so i did it in th grade i would take the bus it was right outside the school multiple times a week to walmart and steal tons of makeup and snacks i would go to dollar tree and get a lot of snacks and other stores too i didnt have the money for the items i was stealing since i was so young dont judge me for this but around that time is when i started drinking alcohol too since i had no way to get the alcohol i would just steal it i was already good at stealing other things so i was really good about stealing alcohol too in the summer of th grade i would drink and sneak out a bunch and of course i stole the alcohol or was apart of the group that was stealing i have never gotten caught shoplifting alcohol but i dont know how to stop since its just so easy i understand the stores keep contact on you and the price of things you have stolen then once its a high amount they get you into trouble im trying to get out of that but i dont have a job its really my only option  im currently in highschool and havent been going out to the stores often as i use to i go maybe once a month now and i quit alcohol but whenever i go to the store i have this feeling i have to shoplift since its so easy
a few months ago i had to do a final video presentation for a class in uni this includes filming myself present a  minutes presentation upload it to drive or youtube and link it plus submitting the screenshots of slides used in the video 

i ended up doing it last minute and since i didnt want to submit it late i just uploaded all the slides i had made and create a corrupted file on pinetools using the video file option and everything to make it looked like a real video file it just that it cant be opened since its corrupted

i know its a stupid decision but this was the last assignment i had to submit and i was way too exhausted and unmotivated at first i was thinking that since itll take awhile to be graded i can make the real presentation video and send it once my professor asks about it i waited weeks then a month and i didnt get contact at all last week i looked up my student record and saw that i already got an a for that class which meant they finalized it i guess they couldnt mind the trouble since i have pretty good grades throughout the semester already and did submit some slides even though there were nothing on there but some graphs

i had been expecting to be contacted this whole time even thinking of the excuses i was going to use now im so relieved that i dont have to make the long ass presentation anymore but felt so guilty because many of my friends had to work so hard on it and i got away with actually not doing much at all




tldr i faked the majority part of my assignment and still got high grade i feel guilty because my friends worked hard for it
 disclaimer i do not actually have cancer

tldr at the bottom

long story short im autistic as shit among other things and have zero zero social skills for conversation which tends to make people very uncomfortable

and often times when i see a homeless person asking for food or saying theyre hungry i approach them and offer them if theyd like a footlong sandwich or something tasty they always say yes

theres no real reason i do this other than the fact that i can i dont feel sad for them or believe in karma or god or whatever someone is hungry and i can help i dont need any other reason that explanation has been met with a wide range of reactions by friends family members and a psychologists ranging from respect to outright horror

this is fine and all however as we walk to the store or whatever they always try to make small talk and ask me why im doing this they ask if im religious or if i believe in a greater good or something or they try to explain why they are in this situation i dont care but it has been explained to me that people feel kind of ashamed in those situations boy have i said the wrong thing before learning that

and things get awkward as all hell as i dont know what to say when someone tells me they lost their job and things didnt go their way in some way or the other because my go to response oh man that sucks has been met with visible discomfort

so ive come up with the solution of just sledgehammering them as soon as they ask why are you doing this with i have terminal cancer i dont have much left so i guess id do something nice before i go and they always get really quiet and mournful of my situation so i get them the food sometimes i ask how many family members they have and buy food for the whole family and afterwards they cry and wish me good luck and tell me im going to heaven or that theyll pray for me i laugh nicely and say things like haha thank you for your kind words

sometimes i have brain cancer sometimes i have lung cancer whatever cancer i feel like having i have noticed its a great way to skip smalltalk and get out of that situation quickly no one knows i do the cancer thing

tldr i like feeding homeless people but i make them uncomfortable when making small talk so i just tell them im dying of cancer to skip the conversation
im never sure if i like someone for who they are or for what they can do for me idk what parts of me are a mask or an act and whats real ive spent my whole life trying to fit in and be liked that i truly dont know who i am

life not live
this is a burner account because i need this off my chest but dont want it tied to me

a relative died gruesomely in a camper i was next of kin so i was saddled with the responsibility of getting rid of it i was told outright that i cant legally sell it until its remediated although im not convinced that was true 

i was also homeless at the time but gahhh this camper was nasty and the fact that it was my own relatives organic matter all over it and it had been sitting closed up for weeks i didnt want to mess with it 

i tried calling remediation services but found them to be expensive and there was really no assistance that i could find for poor people such as myself

after a month of getting nowhere one of my friends convinced me to put it on facebook marketplace for  i said they were insane nobody will pay that 

i was completely honest in the listing even with detailed photos i have no idea how facebook let me post it with those photos it was something that would be covered if it was in the news feed i didnt even take the personal effects out because none of it was untouched

within a day of posting a pregnant woman and her boyfriend showed up and bought it they said they werent afraid of some deep cleaning and they paid  below my asking price

i used the money to get into the house im still living in now years later i still feel like a total pos for putting the couplebaby at risk for my own personal gain
this is not as serious as many posts here but i used to be a pretty bad kid i would harass people i deemed annoying which many were i would intentionally annoy and harass them because i thought it was funny and getting revenge on them one time i kept saying some kids name in a funny way which i knew would make him cry in nd grade he was special needs and i didnt even realize it at the time

i would lie to my friends about having things happen to me and make up fake stories i would make up situations to my friends that never happened to me just to seem cool and have a feeling of satisfaction

when i was  i knew there was some kid who had trauma happen to him not by me and i had mental issues happening at the time not an excuse i purposely harassed this kid knowing that it would make him feel ptsd i might have not wanted him to feel bad but idk for sure

i used to lightly hit my brother until he raged and then we got into fights from it i would also be a hypocrite and do stupid things to him like take away his ipad and then i would get really mad for some reason when he did something back

now i look at my pastself and think how bad i was i apologized to my younger brother i have no idea where the kid with disabilities is and i dont think he even caresremembers but i would like to still apologize to the kid with ptsd im very sorry i hope youre doing better and found good in life just wanted to get these off my chest i hope im not irredeemable yet and i even more hope that everyone i affected and everything is okay
this has been in my heart for so long its been a long time since ive stole something  but this was during  cant remember here tiktok was something really my friends played td and i chose dare they dared me to steal something so i went to a japanese game merchandise store and i saw a really cool figure 


i dont know what struck me but i snatched it off the display and snuck it inside my pocket moments later the gaurd saw me and i tried to run away i knew what i did was wrong but really for me back then i didnt want to do something embarrassing that i cant explain 
so i ran ran and ran i had done it 


months months months later i went there again this time the display was covered with glass bless the owners heart but then i saw the figure again they had replaced it i felt so bad for stealing it i just left the store  i bought something of course and never went back again 


i dont think theyre stationed there now but i really feel so sad whenever i see the figure on m shelf 
when i was out on my own in the city this one guy approached me he asked me if i wanted to go to a bar with him and as i had no other plans i agreed to come with him when we were at the bar he kept asking me how much money i had with me i told him i had  s  and he said he had that much too we then ordered drinks and i noticed that he couldnt really hold a conversation and i got annoyed by that he didnt understand my questions either kept telling me the same things he wanted a woman who was good and who he could go on walks with and to have children he also kept showing me pictures of himself and his family and that was basically our interaction i eventually grew tired of this and grabbed my stuff saying i was going to go to the bathroom he kept following me into the ladies room and when i told him he couldnt come in he waited outside we then went back to the bar and he proceded to pay the bill asking me for money i then faked a phonecall and told him i had to go outside to talk then i just left and walked away leaving him with a bill he probably couldnt pay i was angry at him for wasting my time also at myself for agreeing to come with him out of boredom 
looking back at it i feel kinda shitty for doing that but also think i would probably do it again if i was back in the situation any thoughts on that

edit for clarification he invited me for drinks the drinks he paid for me was  redbull and i took my belongings with me to the toilet because i dont leave my stuff with people i dont know not because it was my plan to not come back and i didnt feel obliged to pay because he had invited me in the first place and i felt like it is a shitty move to invite so and then to change your mind once drinks were served also during conversation i repeatedly told him that i felt like the conversation was going nowherewe were kinda crosstalking which he did not pick up on anyways
i feel like enough time has passed that i can get this off of my chest and not fear repercussions of anyone at my job finding this out while home from college i decided to get a job at a retail store near me the covid lockdown was finally lightening up and no one in my household was immune compromised so i jumped at the chance to get back into the real world though past  years old i had never been employed at a steady job i had done summer camps in the past but those were seasonal obligations and they were more like volunteering gigs if anything since i had slim to nothing on my resume i decided to lie and say that i had two years of receptionist experience from working at a family members business they didnt check my recommendations deeply enough to see the total lie and i was practically hired on the spot two weeks in they began training me on register i hate math i have always been horrible at it no matter how many hours i dedicate to improving it usually ends with me getting super embarrassed and shutting down the first week was tough i was practically throwing random coins at customers hoping that the register would be even and that the change i gave was accurate enough to not raise any eyebrows by the second week however i had really improved by the end of the month i actually looked forward to being on register that premature surge of confidence turned out to be my undoing

when on register we are required to scan all  and  dollar bills to ensure they are indeed real while on register a customer handed me a  dollar bill i tried to use my scanner to check the bill but my machine wasnt working i asked the girl next to me to scan the bill on her machine and to hand it back if approved which she did after that i can only describe my next few steps as a complete and utter blur i had been so tired and had not needed to take my adhd meds since high school as my major in college did not rely heavily on math i remember slamming the register door closed helping the next customer in line and then getting a surge of absolute dread there had been two  dollar bills before that transaction and i could not remember if i had put the additional third bill in the register the registers lock once closed and only managers can open them i refused to inform the manager of my fuck up and decided to stay quiet until i could check myself during the next transaction paying with cash to my horror there were still only two  bills i went into full panic mode i asked the girl next to me if she had handed me back the bill which of course she had that i had remembered but i was so desperate for her to say oh whoops i have it right here here you go she did not and now i had a witness in the missing  bill caper

i checked my section multiple times which only stressed me out more because i known the cameras were capturing my every move at the end of my shift i had successfully gaslit myself in to believing that maybe the register was only supposed to have to s after all to this day i do not know what happened to that  bill

the next time i worked was two days after the incident we were all sat down in a very serious meeting they told us that  had gone missing and the managers had spent all night recounting the registers in hopes of finding it only to be reprimanded by their superior for losing so much money in one night pissed off by getting chewed out by the higher ups they stated that they were determined to find the culprit it took everything within me to not start crying right then and there all that i could think of was the cameras on the register they would see me panic on camera not to mention the coworker that i had mentioned to  to could expose me at any minute i was screwed 

i spent my break crying on my phone with my mom in front of a popeyes as i prepared to come clean before they caught me first i knew it would look bad no way they would believe that i accidentally lost the  bill i was going to get fired at my first ever job after only less than a month my family finally convinced me to stay silent ensuring me that they were bluffing and had no clue years later i am still at said job in a managerial position and spend every shift working my hardest to make it up to my fellow managers 
this wasnt too long ago either im only  and this hangs heavy on my conscience every time i think about it

i cant even think of a way to make sense of it this was during the lockdown during to the pandemic so i may have not been in the best state of mind due to the isolation thats far from an acceptable excuse andor reason for my actions i cant even go into detail remembering it without breaking down so ill save us all the trouble and wont

i guess it may have come from a feeling of power or something feeling superior or whatever it was just an innocent little animal and i just took its life with my own hands for no fucking reason i cant even deal with the fact that it was me but it was and it fucks with me every day i mean ive heard stories of like little kids terrorizing animals because like maybe of the same reasons or they dont know any better or are fucked up in the head but i wasnt a little kid i was a preteen so it makes it so much worse 

and if it wasnt already bad i remember when i was with my mom at the pet store getting the rabbit i was a little brat always begging for a little rabbit that i wasnt nearly ready for let alone wasnt to be trusted with apparently anyway i digress i remember talking to her in the store and the worker said the cage plus the animal all added up to like  and my mom said its this or a ps since they roughly cost the same and i adamantly chose the poor animal  

i dont even feel like i deserve to say ive changed as a person because of how short time has passed only about  years but i feel like have so much has happened for me i feel like a totally different person than i was and i hope ive grown past the deplorable person i was  

im catholic and every time i go to confession i think about confessing it to a priest though i never have the courage to admit it i just sit there and tell all my stupid sins without telling the actual thing weighing on my soul like a coward due to the feeling of being judged 

im crying while typing this from the sheer shame i have even telling this to complete strangers is difficult but i have to get this off of me 

any criticisms and judgements on my character are well deserved and any tips on how to cope with this are welcome im deeply remorseful and i try everyday to be better than who i was im so sorry 

i shouldve chosen the ps

years ago i signed up for an online side hustle job for extra income it was mostly for people who needed help mounting a tv or fixing stuff or doing simple work around the house i signed up saying i had a little knowledge in electrical work and every offer i received was towards electrical work with some other smaller jobs first job i accepted was for a clogged tub in some guys house i went over with a drain snake and draino i paid  for everything and got the tub unclogged in  minutes and made  for it next job i accepted was installing an outlet for  however i stayed up late and overslept missing the job but i still got paid the  expecting it to be taken out it never did i accepted another simple job the next day for  and purposely missed it still got paid for it somehow i found a flaw in the system and i wasnt going to these jobs but still getting the money that people paid the website i did this for months accepting the high paying gigs and never going until one day i got an email saying my account was forcefully deactivated for missing a job but i never got the money taken out or any emails after that i didnt try to appeal it because i knew theyd find the other countless jobs i accepted but never went to
when i was  i had to get a minor operation and i was very nervous that anxiety increased as i was preparing and by the time i was about to be put under i was full on panicking a nurse came up to me with an oxygen mask and tried to put it on me but i went into fight or flight mode and slapped her i dont remember what happened after that 
when i was in first grade there was a girl who was pretty mean to me and long story short i just kinda thought she was a bitch she was one of those girls who would be mean to you and expect you to be okay with it and nice to her and whatever obviously now that im grown and i work with kids that age i understand that they can just be that way and its usually just a reflection of their parents behavior anyways i dont really feel like what i did was so awful not because as an adult i still think she deserved it but just because its generally just kind of funny and harmless she let me braid her hair while we were all sitting in a group on the floor watching a movie or something like that as i i braided i picked my nose and purposely braided my boogers into her hair i still laugh thinking about it because ive thought it over and the way the other kids treated me at that age was despicable kicking me to the ground on my birthday not letting me play on most playground equipment unless i agreed to play the ugly girl or boy in pretend telling me i was lower class convincing me i couldnt be their friend unless i decided to become a christian constantly telling me i was going to hell breaking into the bathroom stalls while i was using them racism etc our teachers saw most of this behavior and did nothing so it really was on them so my small retribution led to nothing besides the likely possibility that when she got home and her parents went to comb her hair they were probably like what the fuck when the comb kept getting stuck in the snot id braided in so im kind of proud that i resorted to braiding boogers into a girls hair instead of violence prejudice bigotry or exclusion like they did i do feel bad however learning that this same girl went on to abuse substance so badly that shes apparently from what ive been told now pretty much a vegetable i dont blame myself for that my booger braiding was not the reason why she got to that point and im really not sure why it ended up that way for her i assume she probably fell into the wrong crowd or what have you id never be one to shame someone for that i have no place to speak but thankfully i am doing better and recovering like i said though regardless of all of that i do feel sad to know that she landed in such an unthinkable situation and i still have empathy for her i hope shes being taken care of well and of course i forgive her for her past meanness she was nicer in high school i always hope the best for people but in a vacuum i do think its pretty funny that i braided boogers into a girls hair when i was like  years old 
when i was around  i really didnt like this boy for no apparent reason and i would pick on him i fed him shavings of rubber and told him it was chewing gum i kicked him in the balls and then i told my mum he bullied me so she told the principal i remember somebody gave me a clear orbee and it reminded me of the pills my mum would give me i told him to take the supplement and he believed me and ate it after i told him what it was he had to go home and i think he avoided me after
looking back i do feel guilty about everything and wish i hadnt been such a mean kid ive learned from my mistakes and im trying to not be quite so evil now lol i did see him a couple years back and apologised for the whole ordeal but he seems to have forgotten about it i hope its not a ptsd kinda deal where its suppressed
hello so essentially ive had an extreme moment of self reflectionawareness
 i was gaming as i normally would and was exposed to what its like to be on the receiving end of insults or being unaware and respectful to others feelings and emotions thoughts and ideas 
being m it had occurred to me to be courteous to others at a much younger age but with time ive lost sight of how kind and considerate but not weak i could be to others i suppose this was a wake up call to learn to watch what you say and remember im not some edgy  year old anymore and im a fully functioning human and so are others ive been on this path of self improvement and care for a while and while this should be one of the first things to learn off the bat its easy for me to be short sighted on the basics of understanding
much love for hearing me out
i chipped the tv while they were out of town i waited for them to get home worried the entire time when they arrived i expected to get screamed at maybe even attacked i thought that day was going to be the last day i ever saw my nintendo  instead they both gave me a hug and blamed themselves
she would always measure out peanut butter for sandwiches i totally understand measuring it out once to see what a serving looks like but this was excessive and i was tired of the measuring spoons always being dirty the measuring spoons were mine so i started keeping them in my room and bringing them out when i wanted to use them nearly  years later this still makes me cringe regularly i knew very little about eds at the time but it was so unbelievably petty 
so its been about  years i was in rd grade and there was this girl who once accidentally probably idk if it was intensional threw ink on me i cried almost instantly since i thought my mom would be mad regardless of what i tell her i went to home but my mother wasnt mad and she understood but i was still stressed so on the next day i decided to stick bubble gum on her hair causing her to cut it really short i was really sorry about it since after this incident she became quite sad for next few days she had really beautiful long hair that she was really proud of we became friends the next year and we have been friends till this day we even attended the same high school and had the same friend group and she is one of my closest friends but she doesnt know i was the guy who did that to her and i cant seem to find the courage to confess this to her

update so i finally confessed to her about it and her reaction was what you guys expected but i didnt she laughed so you were that guy i was stunned and she told me it was okay she was indeed mad at the time but as we grew older that incident become a faint memory she no longer londs it against me boy was i relived to hear that like some wait lifted of my chest
lighthearted confession here in middle school we had an evening party once a quarter with dancing sports bingo etc they also sold candy grams for  cents which would deliver a little note with a bag of candy to the recipient 

i learned that if you purchased candy grams at the end of the night they would be delivered during school the next day and my plan was born i would spend  dollars and send anonymous i like you notes to random people and watch everyone freak out the next day and check handwritings to figure out who sent it

i never told anyone but i did get bored after a year of doing this and stopped for the most part long live middle school drama  
i consider myself a yoyo dieter  someone who loses the weight  then gains it back and repeat last year was by far my biggest success losing  lbs i really  thought this would be the one but i can feel myself slipping back stopped going to the gym overeating when i dont have to telling myself at night ill get it together in the morning then doing it all over again already up lbs im just tired of it all the worst part is i have a huge support group and even like that 
this had happened a few months ago so timing might be a little off this is also my first time using reddit so apologies im not quite sure how everything works yet i am  and a child of a teen mom not long after a break up with my long term boyfriendi was not in the right mindset and needed a distraction i slept with my coworker and tried to be careful but didnt use protection i already knew a mistake was made i just wanted to feel something even for a couple of minutes after a couple of weeks i started feeling uneasy in the mornings and felt some firmness around my pelvic area as well as my period being late i doubted the possibility and just started partying a little more than usual my friends and coworkers at the time assumed my drinking was from my breakup and didnt pay any mind after a little more time i noticed some bloating and started to genuinely freak out this caused me to spiral and start to drinking heavily and cause damage to my abdomen like purposely running into tables and punching myself after some time of this constant punishment i noticed bleeding and blood clotting that was consistent for a few days during this time i was a wreck i had terrible cramps and the whole thing made me go into a deep depression i knew what i did was bad and that it would haunt me for a while after everything was done and my next period came and went i still thought about my nonexistentpotential baby what if i didnt go out of control if it was going to be a boy or girl etc i know i dont want children now or ever but i had a dream that i was playing with this little girl she was maybe around  calling me mama and such which is the whole reason i needed to get this off my chest i know i shouldve taken a test but i was so overwhelmed and i thought that if i never took a test i wouldnt have the confirmation i dreaded im so used to being alone and doing everything myself that i thought i could fix my mistake alone i never told anyone what happened why im not sure and i dont think i ever will

edit i just wanted to answer some of the questions ive seen in the comments i know some were concerned about the age of my coworker he was older than me being  at the time and yes i know that was wrong and i have addressed it in my life others were wondering about my mom involvement during my bender and my childhood my mom does have some mental health issues and she was not very present while i was growing up and she struggled a lot with her own addictions and such in no way am i blaming her or using this as an excuse i was a very sheltered child and was didnt have access to sex ed until around the beginning of hs but due to some family stuff i was never actually educated on the subject my mom is much better now and works most of the time she allows me to drink but ive only ever drank with her before my bender im not a big drinker and its not something im interested in doing in the future i am planning to do to the doctors to make sure everything is okay the situation was stressful and i take full responsibility for my actions and used this as a learning lesson i have since done my best to educate myself on sex and all its variables thank you to those who educated me and for the kind words 
i decided fuck it and threw  into a scratcher machine and bought one  ticket  this is even worse considering im unemployed and using state resources  ive spent  in food stamps this month have gotten  free prescriptions and just this week ive had  free doctors appointments

instead of one ticket the machine accidentally spit out three  they were all folded together so the machine didnt tear them off like it was supposed to

i scratched the first ticket the one that i paid for and nothing  so i scratched the second and third tickets the one i didnt pay for and i won 

i said to myself is this right  should i throw it in the trash  well i didnt throw it away i got my   

i justified it in two ways  first the lottery is fucking predatory  with slogans like hey it could happen and imagine what a buck could get you its selling false hopes and dreams to people who will never get out of a shitty situation  second i once couldnt cash in a  winning ticket while in another state at the airport because there was no fucking attendant next to the machine selling the tickets  how can you sell tickets but not allow people to cash them in

so yeah i got  for free tonight  and i feel okay about that
when i was in kindergarten currently in th gradefemale  we went outside for recess my elementary school had the tiny oval rocks on the playground so when it was time to go in as i was walking through the doors i noticed i had some rocks still in my shoe since i was in kindergarten i had a long walk back down to the kindergarten class rooms i dont know if any of yall schools had nap time after recess but thats what my school was like so i put my sleeping mat next to my friend and i laid down i remembered i had rocks in my shoe so i took the rocks out there were two i threw one across the room and i shoved the other one in my friends nose it apparently got stuck in her nose canal and she had to go to the hospital and they had to get it out

to be honest the title says it all but for more context and to give an understanding of just how bad this has gotten i suppose i should elaborate 

i come from nothing i grew up with nothing i endured awful things just to keep me and my siblings safe and alive but this post isnt about that this is just context

ass i grew up i learned how to make the most of every situation and ended up with nice homes and decent cars and basically was just about spoiled with whatever i wanted within reason

but i decided i didnt want to live as a dependent anymore so i started to truly build a life for myself i got certifications that allowed me to work decent paying jobs and then got into better jobs as i earned better certifications finally my big breakcame i opened many credit cards with decent starting lines of credit i bought a fairly expensive car i moved into a bigger place and then i started shopping 

first it was for necessities like new furniture because i didnt have any then nice appliances because the other ones were just so old 

i had throughout my efforts to become a better person lost a lot of weight so naturally i needed a new wardrobe i started buying hundreds of dollars worth of clothes and shoes every week and accessories and anything that caught my eye really i bought a ps and new oled steamdeck on the same day i continue to buy more and more collectibles clothes games electronics etc
my room looks like a literal shipping warehouse  full of unopened packages that ive bought and have no space for nor the energy to go through in the first place 

the issue is that i cannot afford to keep this up my cards are all nearly maxed at this point and while i havent missed a beat in paying them and i do pay more than the minimums how long can i keep up this sort of lifestyle

i feel ashamed of myself i very much knew the consequences of my actions i know how credit works even if it was bipolar mania or depressive shopping therapy or whatever kind of excuse my therapist could throw at it it was wrong it is wrong 

i wish i could have stopped myself even  months ago and said  thats enough i dont have anything to prove to anyone so i dont know why im doing this and im far too prideful and stubborn for debt relief or debt settlement programs i dont see myself that far gone yet

i guess i just wanted to get this off of my chest ill be working on paying my debts down from here on and controlling my spending 

thank you all for reading my ramblings 
today and yesterday my friend didnt come at work and when arrived at workplace one of our coworkers told me that he gave him money  because his mother got sick and needs to go to the hospital and met him at  before work on sunrisetoday asked from another coworker for the same reason and this guy fell bad for not having the ability to help him this happened today and yesterday and didnt come at work and call the boss with the same lie telling him that hi is  days at the hospital with his mom of course i didnt say anything to the bossnow me im stupid for this i feel like a snitchand this why i want your opinion i told those guys that his mother might be fine and dont feel bad to other guy that didnt have the money this day and he might ask you again for money so dont give him another timei know that he is lying but now i feel like a traitori dont know why i didnt say just that i dont knowim stuoid idkwher i live everyone know his an addict and using the same tactics nobody respects himbut i feel a traitor why i didnt say tha i dont know and i just informed them coworkers exposing my friend


f anonymous account because i am ashamed but need to get this off my chest

ok so this is way longer than i thought maybe i shouldve written it in rvent sorry

so ive been struggling with depression and probably other mental issues for years as in i cant keep a job i got kicked out of college for failing all my classes and i basically became the archetype of the bum kid that spends their days in their parents basement  sometimes i would isolate myself and not talk to anyone for monthes sometimes i was almost in a catatonic state just staring at my ceiling day in day out as the days blended together in a numb trance for monthes my parents wanted me to get an appartement so it could motivate me to grow up so i did they thought i had savings but i spent it all mostly car repairs and glasses so after paying the deposit i moved out with  in my bank account 
i didnt wanna get roomates i didnt know so i asked my friend whose lease ended soon if she wanted to move in together and she agreed even tho i knew damn well i wasnt ready to move out now i feel extremely guilty about it i shouldve let her be

so at first we both paid rent late because we were forgetful and the landlord was really chill about it but i didnt pay for  monthes because i was very broke and i do doordash and had to repair my car and it cost  so of course my once chill landlord got sick of it and took us to court to get me to pay and evict us i honestly knew it was coming but i naively thought i was the only one that would go to court and get evicted and i just accepted it turns out we were both liable and it was her name too that was called for court i was so anxious that i litteraly only told her hour before court we had to go to court which is so fucked up i know i asked her if she could pay the  monthes i didnt pay because the landlord said if i paid he would cancel the court hearing and then we wouldnt have a permanent public records of late paiement which will make it impossible to get another appartement she agreed and i said i would pay her back the landlord still took us to court the judge ruled against the eviction but my roomate got too anxious about the situation so she moved back in with her family she hadnt talked to them in more than a year and moved out to get away from them but she had to go back to them because of me 
she wanted me to pay her back in a week but i didnt have the money i kept not having the money for numerous reasons but it was partly my fault because i should have gotten something more stable than doordash i was terrible with communication and it stressed her out a lot 
me and my dad hung out one day he asked me how i was doing and i said i was doing good even tho i was on the verge of homelessness since i had to pay rent alone and couldnt afford it at all the whole hang out was normal then at the end he told me he knew everything my roomate had messaged him about the money he paid her he paid the rent i owed i was driving on expired plates for monthes and he paid for that i cried so much because i had been lying for monthes to everyone saying i was fine even tho the landlord would be knocking on the door several times i was stresssed out of my mind about money knowing i was one car problem away from having no stream of income when bills would pass i would not eat sometimes i know im so mentally fucked i couldve gotten a better job than fucking doordash i couldve asked for help but i thought my parents would hate me and be sick of me and cut me off if i did i couldnt handle them hating me so i was just gonna be homeless or kms i really fucked up and caused so much stress to someone i considered a good friend shes such a good person and didnt deserve what i put her through the landlord also didnt deserve that and im still living in the appartement even tho he wants me gone cuz i cant find anything else and i know its pissing him off even when she messaged my dad there was an undertone of concern for me its like it wouldve been easier if she hated me but instead last time i saw her she just stared at me with pity the same look people have been giving me lately like they see this mentally unstable loser and cant even be mad just feel bad and be exasperated i wanted to figure things out so bad and be the one to pay her back but i failed again i didnt wanna be a loser anymore i wrote on here because i trust strangers to be unfiltered instead of feeling bad for me i only told people really close to me about the situation and they are nice about it but i need people to not be
not sure how much i canshould say im not proud of this its just been on my mind lately ive had to lie so much i almost forget that this is the truth from the time i was a teenager  mid s i was doing illegal things for money not hurting anyone but illegal none the less  yrs ago i was offered to take over the company would have been all expenses paid move to a nearby city beautiful house barely any work and  million  yearly income anyway i decided it was too much couldnt bare the thought of being caught and leaving my son while i was in jail for  yrs also i know how to feels to be scared every time theres a knock on the door to always think youre being followed and to wake up each day wondering if its your last day being free 

so i quit completely its been bad im not adjusted to normal life and i have nothing to put on a resume even though i have a lot of experience that could be relevant to other jobs my resume is empty my fault i know kicking myself for setting my life up like this all i do now is deliver food i make barely enough to get by its always stress and fear about bills however i never regret my decision at least life is predictable and i know i wont hurt my son by being in jail 
i was bored as a teenager and i knew of a weed dealer who wasnt in town two siblings that would sell weed 
i convinced my neighbor at like  at night to go take us over there 
first we went to walmart and i got bolt cutters
then we went across town they kept there weed in a shed 
i cut the lock an i could see there mom just standing in the laundry room all the lights off in the house except a really dim light 
an my friends were like yo wtf shes standing in the dark how does she not see us 
ohhh dont worry about it shes blind 
bro were stealing from blind people rn 
no were stealing from her daughter who is deaf 
but all we grabbed were two bongs a bag of roaches and that was about it 
the next day when questioned i played it off 
an she told me how somebody stole  pounds of weed out of her shed 
i said wtf thats crazy 
later i felt bad so i told my brother who had introduced me 
yo i kinda robbed them 
to which he replied
bro there mom is blind  everyone robbed them 
the post is obviously long gone now but i still feel bad about it
for context theres this phenomenon on tiktok called reality shifting where apparently people are making up realities and shifting their consciousness into that reality anyways in early summer  i was super into stranger things cause the newest season had just came out i was completely in love with one of the characters steve and wanted to go to that world and be with the characters one day on tiktok i was scrolling on tiktok when i came across a video talking about shifting i kind of knew what shifting was but never really looked into it this video started my interest in shifting i was looking into other peoples experiences and how to do it so i started to try i had been trying for about a month but still no real success i was getting extremely annoying i also started my own shifting tiktok account where i had about  followers im not sure what possessed me to do it but i started completely lying about it i told my close friends about how i apparently shifted and told them all these made up stories how i was best friends with them all at this point i had k on tiktok and started to lie about shifting on there as well and would tell them these lies and they ate it all up and i kind of got satisfaction in it i still was trying and for some reason i assumed if i lied about i was somehow manifesting it and speaking it into existence i didnt show my face on this account but i would spend hours making scripts and tiktoks and i was eating up the attention i was receiving fast forward to october  i kind of started to loose interest in stranger things as i started watching another show gilmore girls and quit attempting to shift but i had like k i began telling my followers about how i was shifting to gilmore girls and made up a bunch of methods yeah and in february i reached  k i was in a super low point in my life but i still made videos and told people how i was shifting to all these movies and shows i still did it until about november of  cause i began getting sponsorships and it was a nice way to get money but one day i thought to myself why am i lying about this like what is the point so since then ive stopped with all of that and personally dont believe in shifting anymore but yeah looking back on it im like what possessed me to do it i still havent told my friends or my followers that i made it all up but i fell like i dug myself too deep in the lie way too long ago so i cant just admit it was all lies now but yeah i just wanted to get this out cause it was lurking on my mind


random edit i thought i should mention i was a dumb gullible yr old who believed everything online which are mainly the target audience for people who believe in it though there are grown ass people who believe in
it too sadly  ive also matured and realized it wasnt real awhile ago
so i was a waitress at a white table top restaurant for three years starting at the age of  i only worked breakfast shift i had a table ask for grapefruit juice and it was the last of it that we had i poured it into the fancy stemmed glass in the kitchen and noticed it was kind of dark and i started wondering if it had gone bad so i literally dipped my tongue into their glass to taste it and see it was fine so i just proceeded to deliver their drink to their table without saying a word it haunts me to this day that i literally tongued someones drink and i still cant figure out why i didnt just get a spoon and taste it that way 
so not as serious as some peoples stories here but i needed someplace to share it as its effected me my whole life and letting it out like this felt like what i needed to do back in third grade i ended up getting mad i had autism and was extremely bullied but there was this one kid who didnt pick on me and i got along well with him but one day i got in trouble for something i dont even remember what it was but for whatever reason i got so mad i grabbed a pen and stabbed that kid in the hand that moment has never left me forever at the time i didnt feel much but a year later the regret set in and its been suck in my head forever hell i have dreams sometimes of going back in time and stopping myself just needed to share
first i say enable i enabled it because i said aight dude if you gonna do that shit then dont shit where you live dont bring them here 
he had the best this or that from these mexicans and felt like he could make a lot of money 
i tried to say why not something else 
i tried to say bro just sell weed with me 
i tried to say you cant sell this stuff if you use it
maaaaan you sell weed an you smoke it 
right cuz its the same as heroin 

i tried to say bro ok dont do it here do it outside 

i even tried to say aight bro i literally have people walking up to me trying to buy crack meth dope everytime im outside ust because of how i look an where we live let me sell it for you i can help 
then no one has to come to our home 

he said no i dont want you involved 
i wish it was something i couldve done other than watching my brother slowly kill himself while i smoke over ten blunts a day 
i wish i wouldve done more like set up an intervention for him 
i miss my brother cuz thats really one of my only friends and it pains me to think that in prison its just as many drugs for him to use
i dont blame myself for his decisions but i wish i couldve done more i regret being an enabler 
i started smoking last year to deal with life i have very little to look forward to in life i feel like im stuck in a repetitive loop of work sleep deprivation and trauma i have had bpd for many years and have done many self destructive things to myself but i dont have the balls to end it all at once smoking is one of the very few things i have in life that i love  i dont feel loved in general and smoking sometimes calms the pain my ribs hurt badly and im coughing a lot of phlegm but i keep going i enjoy some of the breathing difficulties i get from it at least ill die doing what i love 
i used to live in a very impoverished area filled with a lot of homeless addicts everyone in this area would steal to survive and or feed there habits 
so id offer them a job as a discount shopper typically i would pay  cents depending on the list 
i got tvs from walmart some power tools mostly groceries for me and my family though
this went on for the better part of  years 
and too be honest i dont care how i affected walmart target or home depot i feel bad for potentially perpetuating peoples addictions but i also feel as though theyd do this regardless of my discounted groceries 
i went to go on a party with my friends in another city in my country after the party we got to the house of a girl to sleep we continued to drink alcohol and this where it start the day after i woke up with no memory but my friends told me i touched this one girl i didnt understand at the first time but when they explained me they said this was not that bad just that i was trying to lay down and that i touched it while i was laying so i said i was sorry and that i will hate myself for that but weeks later she texted my friend to say that she was feeling bad about it and that she wasnt feeling good in her body because of that so when my friend told it to me i was really shocked so i texted her for trying to help her and myself because i cant stand to hurt poeple so i tried to manage things to make her feel good and i succeeded to do it but she told me that it was longer so i asked to my other friend who said it was not true so idk but i just feel shit about it and i truly hate myself for that can you say me how i have to feel about it i modified to explain some things so all the poeple at the party said that i just falled and my hand touched her vagina but i removed it a second after i have to say that i would not do it on purpose why  because this girl is not my type of girl because even before i met her i was always trying to disgust her because i didnt want our relation to go further  she is kinda a easy girl exemples  when she was flirting with me i was trying to act like someone who is egocentric all the things that would make me seem like a pick me boy this is for clarifying the atmosphere a this after was not normal she was trying to twerk in front of us when her friends where not there its not to antagonise her or smth its for adding some context because a lot of comments didnt understand it fully
i was in high school when i got my first period and i didnt notice when it started i was wearing a skirt as part of my uniform and at the end of class i stood up and noticed the chair was covered in period blood it was a dark chair and not too noticeable i was so embarrassed and just pushed in the chair and went straight to the bathroom i noticed that no blood got on my skirt as it was short enough to be out of the way when sitting the blood also wasnt anywhere visible like down my legs or anything so i just stuck a pad down there cleaned up a little and continued on with my day to this day though i still feel bad because there were  more classes in that room after me and i wonder if anyone sat down in my period blood it was a really heavy flow too

edit im sorry i said stuck a pad down there i thought it was obvious i stuck it on my underwear i literally know female anatomy because i am a girl the kilt has built in shorts like a skort i know what womens clothing is because i am a girl if you want to know what the kilt was like look up mccarthy uniform that was where i bought my clothes for school if youre going to say this is false please stop commenting ive had enough hate already
in the s i had a summer cashier job at a fast food restaurant we were in a very familyoriented suburb and always busy i remember wed occasionally have a kid ball team come in after winning a game and the coach would buy an ice cream cone for everyone and pay with a  

i was kind of naively incredulous seeing the big bills until then the money i had exposure to until then was just from babysitting neighbors like s and s or a  tucked in a birthday card it was my first time handling larger denominations

one summer day a guy came into the store during a mid afternoon lull white guy early s baseball hat tshirt and shorts he looked like any regular suburban dad swinging by after a trip to home depot or something

he stood around a few minutes before stepping up the register i assumed he was either deciding what to order or waiting for some to join him he ordered a single ice cream cone with a really friendly manner presenting a  with a flourish and a smile 

when i felt the bill i immediately knew it was fake it was slippery smooth and thinner weight he saw my flash of recognition that it was fake he watched me intensely to see what my reaction would be i felt like he was challenging me to speak up like yeah what are you going to do about it 

i felt intimidated and nervous id only worked there a couple weeks by then i had no training for how to handle counterfeit money we didnt even have one of those markers to test on the spot 

after my brief fluster i accepted the bill and counted out his  or we in change his demeanor flipped from intimidating back to the friendly dad persona i filled the cone and served it to him as he left i thought wow that guy just walked in here with nothing and left with ice cream and 

i knew fake money was illegal but i didnt realize just how illegal i didnt mention it to my managers i was afraid that id be in trouble for not denying the purchase and accepting it the register didnt have a section for big bills so i hid it under the s truth be told i forgot about it 

a little while later the guy came in again i did not recognize him on sight but when he handed me that slippery smooth  bill i remembered him and the prior transaction he didnt give me the intimidating look the second time probably he was comfortable with his mark not addressing him 

i wasnt even nervous the second time i justified it by thinking nothing happened last time this isnt my problem i just counted out his change and handed over the ice cream 

a couple weeks later one of the managers mentioned that the cops had come into the store he told us that counterfeit currency that was traced back to our store and to watch for anything suspicious at that point i hadnt even considered that money could be traced 

obviously the bank caught it when they did the deposit and passed it over to the cops it had been more than two s i took thinking back over it now i realized when the guy was hanging around before ordering he was casing the place deliberately chose a teenage cashier went at a quieter time to be in and out and waited for my coworkers to be distracted 

counterfeit currency sounded a lot worse than fake money cops were now involved i didnt want to be in trouble for passing counterfeit currency i didnt want to admit it was me who had accepted it i didnt want to explain why i didnt speak up i said nothing

  
  
  


edit because its become ridiculous content harvesters i do not grant permission for this anecdote to be used elsewhere tiktok buzzfeed and so on jeez you guys are really bustin my chops here i had one story of mine show up on tiktok and another that was mine but heavily edited in one of those listicles i thought that was total bs sorry for my original edit but i will leave it for lolz ok
as a kid i have a vivid memory of me getting ice cream cones that my parents bought me and i would purposefully push the ice cream off the cone with my tongue and make it fall on to the ground i would of course pretend as if it were an accident after doing this i would then act very sad and as if the world was ending essentially to make my parents feel bad and most of the time they would end up asking the guy at the store for a new one or they would buy me another ice cream cone i had reasonings as a kid for this though i would only push the ice cream off the cone with my tongue once i was about th the way into eating my ice cream cone this way when i would drop the ice cream to the ground and get a new one i would have a total of  and  of an ice cream to myself i feel extra bad because i would do this a lot when my father took me to sporting events in town and then would have to buy me two ice creams at an outrageous price they had them for sale at the game feel bad to this day but that extra th of an ice cream made sense in my head logically
i didnt have enough money to stay in new york city and i didnt have enough money to leave new york city 

i had just ended a  year relationship he was cheating i was grateful to end it and had just enough money to get my own apartment 

also i kept having fibroids in my breasts they were so painful i was able to get a prophylactic mastectomy covered by my companys insurance plan so i took it my neighbor assumed i had breast cancer after my surgery and i never stopped her from thinking that she never officially asked but she took me under her wing an older woman i was between boyfriends and not close to my family 

well thats when the lie started i didnt stop her i needed her  i felt so lost and alone then i remember the first time the lie crossed my lips  i told a friend i had cancer  and she suggested i get treatment back at home in texas i thought could this be my justifiable reason for going back home i was always afraid of what people thought of me if i returned home she couldnt hack it in new york she failed 

i used the lie to move home moved back to texas got an apartment for th the price i was paying in nyc i cut off my long brown hair cut it really short  pixie cut people would ask about my losing hair and i said no that it doesnt happen to everyone of course it does  but somehow everyone in my life believed me id fake doctor appointments so those closer to me thought i was getting treatment 

that was almost  years ago i still live in texas and am married with children having had cancer lives in my past it rarely comes up today every opportunity ive had to donate  walk for breast cancer i have the guilt is very much present 

no one in my life knows about this not even my husband he knows every single thing about me  except for this it is kind of wild typing this out because ive never breathed these words out loud to anyone

i didnt realize that a little pressure would lift up off my shoulders dont get me wrong  still tons of pressure  but i am feeling a little shift by sharing ps ive had  miscarriages and my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer survived deep down in my heart i feel as those both of those are because of this lie  
when i was  i worked for our local stop  shop it was  so there werent any cameras i worked behind the customer service desk and found out that we didnt account for the bottle slips so when people redeemed them at the register we just rip them up at the end of the night in my head i was thinking sweet ill just enter into the register  and take the cash and go buy a sandwich on break when i told my coworker friends they took it up a notch and said well why cant we just redeem  at a time and take the cash it began a competition on who would take the most during a shift well i didnt know it at the time but a few more cashiers were doing this too but our influx of additional theft alerted the managers there was a heavy uptick of bottle slip redemptions so they ran a report and found all of us but could not prove it there were no cameras our drawers were always correct all they had was that report of the redemptions so we all got to quit with no charges pressed to this day when i go in that store i feel so guilty and bad i have not done anything like that since 
so i used to have a water bottle but it broke yesterday and i literally have no money rn to the point where ive been walking  h every day to go home from work because i dont even have money to take the bus so i went to the supermarket and took a black marker with me i grabbed a bottle of water started walking around as if i was going to buy something else and then in an empty aisle i scribbled over the barcode trying not to face any cameras this is literally the first time i do something like this and im just waiting to get paid at the end of the month ill pay off all my debts and im hoping everything will go back to normal because ive never been in a situation like this i never thought i would have to steal a bottle of water just to be able to have some water and i feel weird and guilty of course im not proud of this but i really didnt know what else to do its the middle of the summer it was past noon and i hadnt drank water all day
if youve ever been to a clothing store at least in the us youve probably seen that almost every item has a papercardboard tag attached to the item with what is usually a plastic string at the end of the tag theres a little section at the bottom with the price

every summer my mom used to take me and my brother later on to this huge strip mall a city over to shop in all these outlet stores to shop for clothes for the next school year this affair usually took a whole day morning till sunset and it was an absolute drag i was a little kid with no interest in shopping being carted around a very hot slab of concrete and asphalt while holding bags of clothes and shoe boxes it wasnt commonnormalized for kids to have phones yet so i had to do the next best thing which in my mind was to remove the bottom parts of the price tags of every article of clothing on a rack or in an aisle while my mom shopped

in my criminal escapades i was only caught once it was in an old navy where an older employee caught me in the act and sweetly told me to not do that i was overwhelmed with guilt not just because she went about it in such a nice way but because the left front pocket of my shorts was already filled to the brim with these little paper rectangles and i had probably desecrated a quarter of the stores apparel by then

eventually the pandemic hit and a lot of our shopping moved online so my days as a career criminal came to a natural conclusion recently my parents and i went on another shopping spree on my accord for my th birthday we went to an old navy and while we were there i saw the price tags and was flooded with mixed yet surprisingly strong emotions

i dont know the extent to which i could have caused damage to the stores involved i dont quite care for how i could have possibly hurt the big department stores but the idea that i might have made retail workers jobs harder in my boredom does stir up guilt
more than  years ago i had the bright idea of vandalizing my highschool me and a couple of friends jumped the schools gate and broke into the cafeteria and all the vending machines i returned many times after on my own 
at work i spread my butter on my toast then using the same knife i dip it in the jam jar

inevitably some butter gets left in the jam jar

people are upset but they dont know its me
when i m was  years old i worked in a sports arena and stadium for the same company i sound and look very professional so in about  months time they started giving me the position of interim stand manager meaning that i would perform as an assistant to a supervisor or basically run the stand and manage the other employees 

i was also a cashier and at the end of the events we use a key to unlock the registers i was such a trusted employee that i would be in charge of the register key at the end of the event one time the supervisor forgot to get the key back from me and thats how it all began 

ways i stole when someone would make an order and it was possible to give them the exact change in bills i would act like im ringing them up do the math and put the cash under the money tray in the register the only way to open the register is to either ring someone up or use the key so obviously i would use the key to open the register when i was in a stand that had cameras i would loan out the key to a friend who was at a stand with no cameras so they could perform the theft and we would arrange how much money they would give me at the end of the night 

ways i extorted as an interim stand manager i would sometimes catch people stealing then i would go up to them and let them know that if they didnt give me x amount of money i was going to report them sometimes they would be reluctant but im  and  pounds occasionally when they would be reluctant i would let them know i would catch them after the  event when theyre walking to the parking lot and if that occurred then i would take all the money  keep in mind the arena had a metal detector i had a gold knife attached to my belt buckle on the inside of my pants so when they checked me they always assumed it was my belt buckle that was being detected occasionally i would have to show the thief what i had but i never let them see where i took the knife from because then i would be exposed

also when i was stand manager for football games i worked on the first floor right next to what is equivalent to a vip section its been some years so i forgot the exact term think about it only people with hefty pockets can afford to be ground level at a professional sports stadium they gave great tips and i was the only cashier so they would give the tips to me at the end of the event i would have usually around  in tips the prep workers expected tips and it was usually about  or  of them i would give them about  dollars at the end of the event and keep the rest for myself the company didnt pay me more to be an interim stand manager so i made sure to pay myself at the beginning and end of the events i would do inventory and bookkeeping which the preps didnt have to do so fuck the preps i want all the money 

i know im an asshole
when i was in fifth grade i wanted to kill my best friend for some reason his name was larry and he had this bowl cut that i just absolutely despised even though it didnt bother me directly i just hated it  so one day i was like yeah im gonna murder him there was this one kid named nick in on it as well we never talked before so i dont even know how we got the idea to just slowly kill larry we would steal chalk from the teacher and dump it into larrys spiderman water jug it was a thermos so it wasnt the transparent kind 

we did this everyday at lunch we would do small amounts as to not make it obvious and everyday larry would feel sick not knowing why 

one day we decided to add more chalk like a shit ton than we usually would into his jug to see what would happen and at lunch he was basically vomiting his guts out it was all multicoloured and stuff because of the chalk colours me and nick were laughing our asses off and larry realized whats been going on and snitched to the teacher but me and nick had a plan there was this one really weird kid named sean and everyone knew that he liked mixing chalk into his water bottle and sean just so happens to sit beside larry so we blamed sean and sean got sent into the principals office after that sean got transferred into a different classroom and he was never allowed to leave the room at lunch again we would just see sean looking sadly outside the window at lunch from his classroom all alone eating his lunchables im so sorry sean you were a nice dude

when i was  i was really obsessed with undertale but my skank mom called up the school and said it was to violent my teacher wouldnt let me talk about it anymore even though it was a special ed class so she should have known it was my hyperfixation and that undertale is not violent i of course continued on with my obsession and drew a picture of it in lunch once and my friend tried taking it from me to take to the teacher and he ran away from me as i chased him through the lunch beams and tables i caught him a choke hold and then he lied to the teacher saying he did nothing wrong so my best friend and i planned to off him with peanut butter as he was allergic  and use gloves while doing it we never did it of course but we had a whole plan to sneak it in his food  i told my bus friend and she never sat by me again sense yall are so negative which i of course predicted yes ik i was crazy i was also a immature  year old  get over it i would have never done it even if i was loopy and a child i had a moral code 
so  
ive started uni quite a few years ago after st year and during pandemic i decided to change my field of study starting a new one then i decided to keep that to myself for as long as possible as my family is very strict about learning and me getting a degree i hope this will help everybody visualize better  
year   st degree course dropped out because it wasnt really interesting for me  
year   i got into new university started new degree couse but due to pandemic and severe lack of willpower to study i dropped out again  
year   i decided to start the same degree course anew i told nobody from my family but someone found out because of letter that they opened  
year   i continued the course but dropped out because of  anxiety i guess i just couldnt keep up with the pressure  
year   i should be writing my bachelor thesis and thats what everybody is thinking but i started a new degree course  
all that time ive been lying to my family friends and my wonderful girlfriend i really dont know how to get out of that spiral of lies i feel constant fear about the need to come clean and what will they say i dont really have greatest connection with my parents  they pay for my life and expect me to get a degree i think i should go see a psychologist but i know that this wont help with the consequences i know i deserve them but i cant lose my partner she is everything that is worth living for
when i was  my older brother and i were playing with the potato gun he made to look like actual military hardware my dad came out to check on us just as our potato sailed past the target and over the fence of our neighbors gaudy mansion it rocked an suv that was pulling out of the driveway containing our neighbor who was a russian mobster hiding in the states from the russian government we threw the potato gun to mad dad and ran inside just as several bodyguards jumped out of the car reaching under their clothes presumably for guns so my dad had a mini faceoff with mob goons while he stood there with a smoking tubebazooka looking toy 
nothing happened because they needed to keep living in this community 
then a few years later the mob family fled in the night abandoned the house and the mob dad was eventually found murdered in colorado so of course i shot out all the windows with my bb gun the abandon mansion next door
basically what i was trying to do was get a perfect throw in between road and below car body as car was moving so that the rock would come out on the other side

 i dont know why i even wanted to do that we were playing something totally unrelated on the playground and as the car was coming by thought of rock throwing just instantly appeared in my mind then i picked up first rock i saw and threw it 

it ended up hitting the passenger door quote loudly and car came to a stop it was then that i saw that driver was a minority person which i only later realized it has deeper meaning

sure we were kids and i just run away but what bugs me this whole time is the fact that the driver must have felt really bad that poor person could have gotten the wrong idea  that my parents were teaching me to hate and that there is secret discrimination despite the fact that i was a dumb kid
i feel guilty for this and i know i need to go back to therapy but until then i need to just need to get this off my chest and kind advice too 

my daughters crying is a guttural scream that makes me tense up all the way like im being dragged to hell multiple times ive yelled or raised my voice towards her or at her in the midst of this because i feel like im actually going to explode i have scary intrusive thoughts i know i wont do but the ppd makes me feel like im stuck for life like shes only  months and im losing it and i dont know if i really will get better 

i was so happy before having her and now i feel like her existence will drain everything out of me even though i did want her her dad left us when i was pregnant with her and he was emotionally abusive as well there werent red flags in the beginning i gave a sweet nice guy a chance only to find out he actually is a menace to many women and i feel so stupid he calls me names rubs in my face i dont have what he has materialistically and just overall a mean person 

i wish i didnt have breaking points so i can be everything to my baby i kept her because once i heard the heartbeat at about weeks  i knew in my heart she was meant to exist and we were meant to be together but ppd has been ruining it for me i feel bad for my daughter for having a depressed mom i feel bad because i believe that all of the hard therapy work  subconscious reprogramming journaling prayer meditation yoga venting church and more has been for nothing im still a horrible person whos traumas get triggered everyone around me and online seems like they have it together ive yelled at her at least  times and i swore id never be like my adoptive and biological parents with the abuse now i feel like im down a nasty road i hope things change

thank you for you kind messages and suggestions too even though its only been about a day since ive posted this confession ive talked to a lot of family  friends im going to my doctor to be prescribed medication again and ive implemented some of the coping mechanisms you all have suggested like the earphones with music she likes pierce the veil too stepping out for  minutes it was hard because i know she just wants a hug but being overstimulated is not good for me crying i cried a lot i didnt realize how much sadness was actually behind that anger especially the betrayal i faced dealing with her biological father take note of what phase of anger im in to dictate my wellbeing a daycare tour is set and talking it out never would i have expected this to blow up the way that it did but im glad it did before i was pregnant i was a completely different person  the one to advocate for childrens safety and care but it all changed when i gave birth and had a traumatic stay due to preeclampsia as lovely as the hospital staff were to me and my family 
i know some people will see this post and automatically assume im the devil but hey at least i was honest about my struggles and not hiding it to be honest seeing the way some people called me a shit mother and telling me to give my baby up for dealing with postpartum gave me the boost to not give up as depressed as i may be call it pride or ego idc ive always wanted to be a mother and im not letting ppd win especially some folks who have  idea what this actually is i get you care about a childs safety too though so i respect it in a way 
anyways i may or may not update this post later once im on my medication for a consistent amount of time but i hope this post gives everyone who has dealt with ppd either first hand or witness or even heard of it to reach out for help and reach out to help others as well this is real life and shouldnt be a taboo topic the more shame is thrown at people like me the less likely they will receive help and that is very true all across the board for any problems in life  
i grew up in new jersey in a neighborhood behind a farm with cows the pasture had a part that was down hill to our home and every winter we would sled down that hill a couple of years before my parents divorced and we moved away the farm was sold and they were building new homes on the pasture my friend and i would go play on the construction equipment when no one was there
one day we did something different we pulled out all of the stakes in the ground every single one of them i learned later that was for the surveying of the utilities and future neighborhood streets letters went out to everyone in our neighborhood seeking information on who did it with a  reward
we kept our mouths shut and i never went back there again it was funny to see the reactions of my older brother and mother when i spilled the beans  years later when reminiscing about that house and neighborhood during a family dinner the middle child had a delinquent side
like it says in the title i bought a tagging gun and every third time i buy something i retag something from my closet that i dont want and is the same size and return that instead this charity shop gets a lot of returns because it doesnt have changing rooms i also donate there frequently out of a sense of guilt but im outta work and having new clothes makes me feel better

edit guys ive sat with your comments for a while now i stopped doing this and put that kimble gun to good use tagging clothes from my closet for a resale event and everything left over went straight to that charity shop i still go there a bunch and just buy things i blamed it on not having enough money and i dont but its also something deeper and you guys helped me realize thanks reddit xx 
back in  i saw this teacher im like omg its luigi and everybody thought he really looked like him it became a thing and it started from a harmless prank to disrespect when they started to call him luigi in the middle of the class or when he enters he finds the name luigi written on the board and sometimes a drawing of the teacher as luigi he hated it bad he was furious

 guys from the other grades got suspended cause he caught them calling him luigi the school wrote this on the anouncement board we know that some students gave a nickname to a certain teacher we are working to determine who did this we wont tolerate this behaviour and anyone who do this will get suspended andor expelled when i saw it i was trembling with fear cause they can easily make their way to me if any of my classmates talk i was right to be afraid cause not only they made it to my class but narrowed it to only  me and  friends with the help of an anonymous tip  it was the daughter of another teacher we all knew she would talk none of us said anything cause we were all in this together if they say im the one who came up with the name i will tell them they are the ones behind the drawings they asked us to bring a parent tommorow i wanted to bring my father since he is nicer but he refused so my mom went with me i told her that they think one of us  did it but im innocent and my mom got so angry she went there and started a fight yelling at the principal the teacher luigi and everyone there my baby would never do this i know him well he never got in any problem its your fault for making my son sit in the back of the class now he will always be accused of anything that happens cause he sits there the other parents didnt get to say a word omg i was so happy my  friends didnt tell the truth after this everyone in the school calls him luigi even outside they see his car and they start screaming luigi luigi

edit  forgot to mention that i met one of my friends last month and he told me that there are rumors luigi might become a principal

 years later everyone keeps calling him luigi even my neighbour who started middle school this year and i heard him mentioning him that teacher deserves better than this
it all started in th grade and we had to color a shoe i thought mine looked cool but all the kids laughed at it i then started crying and yelling i cant help it im colorblind im not and i had to keep this up until th grade after i moved schools and graduated i got a message on instagram from a guy i used to go to school with before i moved apologizing for the incident in th grade should i tell him
one time when i was shopping at walmart i had a pack of water bottles on the bottom of my shopping cart when i checked out i completely forgot and didnt realize until i got home the water bottles were worth about  dollars probably i havent told anyone until this post

for context im a  year old male on the autism spectrum and all throughout my life ive treated the ones i love like actual trash without realizing it until now i sort of always knew to some extent subconsciously but now its gotten to the point where ive burnt so many bridges and hurt so many people that ive more or less realized im the problem and am generally a very bad person  


most of this stems not only from my autism and how it makes me struggle socially but also all the trauma and trust issues ive developed from my abusive childhood most of the bridges ive burnt stem from me accusing the other person of doing xyz out of paranoia showing extreme distrust and overall just constantly feeling like everyone is out to get me  


it doesnt matter how close someone gets to me and how good they treat me i always end up thinking one day theyll secretly backstab me and then i sabotage everything because my paranoia has to fuck everything up my friends and family cant even ask me simple questions without me getting extremely defensive andor aggressive because im so afraid of being hurt only to now realize i was hurting myself anyway  


i desperately need therapy but knowing me ill probably end up thinking my therapist is out to get me too  


im a horrible person and i just needed to confess that
every morning on my way to school i would pass by this car parked on the street for some reason i got this twisted thrill out of messing with it so one day i decided to remove the valve stems from all four tires and continued doing it at random it wasnt because i had any ill will toward the owner or anything like that i didnt even know who they were i was just bored and looking for something to do

  
at the time i didnt fully grasp the consequences of my actions i thought it was just a harmless prank but looking back now after serving in the army myself i realize just what havoc i must have brought to this poor guys life i could not imagine have to call my stsgt multiple times with the exact same story of having  flats with the valve stems missing

  
i never got caught but i have thought about that poor soldier on more than one occasion and thought to myself how could i have been such a little asshole

  
to whoever owned that car i am truly sorry for what i did i hope you never had to face any serious consequences because of my actions
from the ages  i only panhandled to survive 
once my dad stop paying child support my family and i became homeless there were many days we were at the point of starvation until i decided to panhandle at first i only did it so we could have one meal a day buy as i realized i could get much more it eventually kinda became like a job and we used the money to check into a cheap hotel every night 

i was fine with it at first because i felt like i was helping my family survive but my mother refused to get a job and didnt want my brother and i to work either my brother is  years older so he was already an adult at this time my mother told me that she had a search warrant for her arrest so if she got a job the cops will find her and arrest her i found out years later that it wasnt true i believed her for like  years 

we spent years just going from town to town state to state doing the same thing and i would be the only person panhandling my family never did because apparently people would have more sympathy for the youngest person i was a very obedient child so it never crossed my mind to rebel until i was  

my mother ended up winning a lawsuit with someone and got a few thousand and we spent it living in airbnbs i enjoyed not feeling homeless or asking anyone for anything so much that i decided to finally rebel and just get a job so i could continue that lifestyle  my mother was very upset by this and it wasnt easy at all for me because of how much she gaslit me but i finally did it 

at  years old i had no education or work experience so it was hard at first but now a couple of years later im living normally but still support my family financially panhandling has cost me lots of psychological trauma and my self esteem is at  i also dont know how i can ever stop supporting my family because they wouldnt have anywhere to live if i did i love them very much but they are toxic 

this is something i would never tell anyone that i meet because im so ashamed of my past and looking back really wished i had it in me to rebel much sooner because by now my life wouldve been better and i feel really depressed that i wasted my youth
when i was in elementary school i was being a dumb little kid and decided it would be a wise choice to throw a rock as high as i could up into the air next to my playground of course our playground was right next to the teacher parking lot so you can guess the rest it slammed on either the hood or windshield of a teachers car making a loud thud their was a long path between the door to the school and the playground and i was walking alone i immediately looked to see no witnesses and then i just kept walking still feel bad about it today at  im honestly surprised i never got in trouble because even then our school had security cameras
the other day i went grocery shopping at a local chain grocery store i had two full carts of food as i dont have a car so i try to do as much as i can in one trip i got to the check out and before the first cart was empty my total was over  i didnt look again and kept unloading well at the end of the second cart the cashier paused the transaction so they could catch up with bagging and make room for more during that time there was a shift change the new cashier was told by the original about the pause but she forgot and started scanning the rest of my groceries as a new transaction i saw it happen and didnt say anything i ended up only paying  for two carts of food ive really been struggling so this seemed to be a huge blessing in my favor but now i cant help but wonder if i got someone in trouble or worse fired
i was in undergrad and i wasnt in a fraternity i heard that this massive and wealthy fraternity was throwing a party and i knew all the hot sorority girls would be there

there was a guy in my class who was a member he was cool but a little awkward i struck up a conversation with him and consistently focused on engaging him my plan was to have him invite me he eventually did and i went

i proceeded to go to the party and i had a great time problem was i ignored my friend all night and focused on talking to ladies he later called me out on this and we stopped talking its been a few years and i feel bad i just was an amoral scumbag at the time and didnt care about his feelings

i did get this cute womans number though so that was cool i ended up ghosting her since she wanted to go on a date before sex man i was a piece of shit lol
trigger warning this involves the death of someone drugs and illegal activites

so long story short had a serious drug problem at  and family didnt know about it very few friends did and even they didnt know the extent of it 

i got the news about pm on june th that my best friend and my godson she was pregnant had died later that night i found that her fianc was drunk and wouldnt let her drive he hit another pregnant lady driving head on she gave birth that night my best friend was  at the time and did not want her father to be mad about curfew so she let him drive i happened to be in love with her and we had dated on and off for  years known her since the nd grade 

anyways so at pm im in my car waiting on my friends to get alcohol from walmart when i got the call we were going to a party i told them and they asked if we were still going to which i replied why not this is where i had my first  loco  of them to be exact  when we left the party to take her and some extra friends home she begged me to take them home and i said no but i let my dick do the talking and yeah got  of them home and had to make  more stop  miles away because they didnt tell me it was in another freaking county 

well on the way back from the last stop i happened to know of a large damned reservoir that would be easy to drive into it was fairly deep and considering how fucked up the night went i was ready 

a little background parents are divorced for  years at this point they were still in a custody battle over me step dad died a couple years prior he was my dad in many ways and i still call him dad to this day and i was just starting college on my own with little to no support 

on the way to the last drop off for the night i was on a curvy road and couldnt keep the car in the lane thats when i got pulled over i was  and had  years olds in the car so it was a really big deal i thank god all the time for that dui because without it i would be with my best friend and nephew physically at the bottom of a lake though 

i dont know if this is too dark for this sub bc everyone always talks about the pair of scissors they stole when they were  ps i stole a pair of scissors when i was  and have felt endless regret to the old lady who smiled at me on the way out of the door or the dollar bill they picked up off the streetdid not do this it was a bus floor but it feels good to get this off of my chest 

sorry for the grammar 
i was pretty popular at my school when i joined life was good until a new kid arrived when i was about  i dont know how but over a really short time he managed to take over my friends group and push me out 

unrelated to this one day i thought it would be funny to steal the glue and scissors which i did i was planning to return them after the amusement had been had only the teacher went mad they were being way over the top and they decided that if someone didnt own up to it everyone would suffer the class was starting to get really worried and were basically saying that whoever did it should just own up

i stayed quiet and the teacher searched all our lockers and belongings they found the glue and scissors in the locker of the new kid id put them there originally as the locker was open i didnt even realise at the time it was his locker but when the teacher found them i stayed quiet thinking that the worst that would happen was that theyd get a minor telling off only the teacher was being ridiculous and was still really angry they went crazy at the boy and no matter how much he said it wasnt him the teacher just kept going crazy eventually the teacher took him to see the deputy head the boy was in tears his parents were called and he ended up in detention for a week i felt pretty awful that i hadnt said anything but i thought it was too late

im in a whatsapp group with old school friends and they were talking about random people when they mentioned the kid i blamed all those years ago they were talking about how he was always such a dick  i cant stop thinking that maybe he wasnt actually a dick but i kicked off his life of being labelled a dick by blaming that whole episode on him its too late now but it was definitely a shitty thing to do even if i was 
i was diagnosed with add like adhs without the h when i was  years old the psychiatrist prescribed ritalin which i also took i received a pack of  per month x mg per day it was payed my dads health insureance one pack would have been like 

at some point i started to open the capsules and crush the fine grains inside with two shot glasses and then snorted the powder out of curiosity

when i realized how relativ strong i guess it was like weak mdma or so never took it the effect was i showed it to my friends we started taking it almost every weekend then daily at school later work or in the evening when we were outside

over time others noticed it and wanted it too from then on i started selling it at a completely overpriced price  pill   and made a lot of money with it some times i even selld it pregrinded and slightly punched with white snuff this menthol stuff for an easy  per gram

there was nothing else around besides weed or hash and cocain was obioulsy to hard and barely available for kids my age

i just went to the psychiatrist to get the prescription he was partially surprised at how much i needed and asked for it so i reduced the amount so it wouldnt be noticeable

at that time i was already  or  and took it every day it helped me a lot to get through the day without forgetting everything and dreaming away  swallowing the pill had no effects anymore

at some point there were people in my circle who were dealing with harder stuff this made me aware of what i was actually doing and afraidparanoid about getting caught so i just stopped doing it

to this day no one except my old friends knows that i did that

oh yeah i mainly used the money for alcohol which i always had a former heroin addict buy for me  weed food clothes or games  even if my family wasnt poor no we lived in a house my dad never brough me the stuff i wanted not that i wanted much but for exp i needed new pants i really wanted to wear hiphop fashion but no my father forced me to go to a mens clothing store because i was fat and my size wasnt available in the childrensyouth department but i just wanted cool wide pants from pelle pelle or ecko which were much cheaper but no he forced me into these oldfashioned clothes i always had to lie to him about where i got the things tell him friends didnt need them anymore or change clothes at a friends house before we went out
while i was at uni i used to live  in a shared house with  other girls who were my uni mates 
sometimes i would sleep on my bed in my boxers with my willy out the side pretending it flopped out while asleep and pretend to be asleep if someone came in as left the door slightly open 
sometimes they made jokes that their friends saw my manhood and i would just laugh it off pretending i wasnt aware but i was and knew they saw it but it led to nothing i just used to like flashing myself pretending i was asleep
i was thinking back about my childhood and i have this very clear memory when i was in prek we had this very troubled kid hed bully us steal from us hed hit some of the other students as well all around bad kid i remember one day my teacher had enough  and she held him down lined us all up and told us we could hit him once one by one in line we each had our turn to punch slap or kick the kid i remember this vividly because i remember getting in trouble for kicking him twice even though it was  years ago i was just thinking about this and how fucked up and illegal it was that kid was awful but he didnt deserve that i wonder if he remembers that day too

so this all started in my first year at middle school some years ago i wanted to be a new person and told everyone that i was going to be vegetarian from that day onward it lasted about a month as time continued i felt guilty wasting the meat rather than eating it so instead i went back to eating meat but i already told everyone im vegetarian so my great idea was to eat it in secret now imagine the scene from the i think you should leave show where tim robinson ate that hotdog out of his sleeve that was exactly what i did i would sneak full breakfast sausages up my sleeve sit there pondering with my mouth placed on my hand sneaking nibbles of this sausage and this lasted my entire middle school id be surprised if no one noticed
i think im going crazy and i dont not know where to get advice
can you help me with my situation 
i am  years old man i dont know if that would help 
i dont know what to say more than that just need help
the year was  and i was visiting my friend lets call him ryan at his college for an extended weekend it was a great time overall and i got to meet a lot of his college friends we went to a handful of parties and this one in particular was at a frat house ryan was friends with some of the frat brothers so we got to the house early to pre game and hang out with everyone i some how got put in charge of the jungle juice container everytime i had to be refilled i would bring it from the basement to the kitchen and then back down 

to give you an idea of just how much  year old me was drinking i had probably had about  shots while pregaming then the jungle juice trips i would just scoop my cup into the mix while they were making it and there was also a keg so yes i was very very drunk the theme of the party was boxer bros and panty hoes so the guys were in basically t shirts and boxers or pajama pants and the girls were pretty much all in bras and panties

xb

anyway at one point i found myself unable to physically carry the jungle juice container anymore and was relieved of my duty so i started talking to this girl and dancing with her while she was grinding on me i puked all over her back side and in her hair couldnt hold it in not that i had much of a warning to myself it just came out and a lot of it i then started stumbling all around this house puking everywhere any cup or flower pot i could find behind a chair maybe under a coffee table i puked everywhere like a dog marking its territory 

xb

i made my way upstair to the calmer area of the party and saw ryans friend jay sitting on one of the couches so i went over to him and sat down a few minutes into us talking jay picks up his solo cup and throws upburps up beer into it and puts it down on the coffee table one of the frat brothers comes storming over to us and starts yelling at jay that he has to leave because hes the one throwing up all over the place they kick him out and i start to try and defend him saying he wasnt that drunk and they need to calm down  i was quickly booted as well 

xb

i somehow snuck back into the frat house and got ryan to leave the party with me and jay and we went back to the campus and to their dorms and smoked a joint and passed out to this day ryan and jay have no idea i am the reason we had to leave  
i really dont know how to start this sooo when i was younger i actually copied everything what my friends did i didnt have an opinion and my only goal always was to fit in i was so scared of rejection that i didnt see any other way to behave like them 
one day my best friend laughed about my old shoes she asked me if i had found them in the trash it felt like my whole appearance that what i always what i always wanted to be was destroyed
i knew my father was stingy and wouldnt understand why i would need the money later when he was in his office i seized the opportunity and took his wallet next to his bed i took  euros and bought new shoes i still feel so bad about it and im not brave enough to confess him the story
for context i have a less severe case of mobius syndrome so in middle school we had swapped seats and i sat next to this girl jolie her friend stacy sat behind us fake names we had moved seats and her friend started to talk to her stacy thought she was whispering but i heard everything she had said that she felt bad for jolie stacy then said that she was sitting next to me the weird looking kid so i knew i had to get revenge for some more context everytime we would have a test in this class the teacher would come around and check our desks to see if we had any study guides with us we werent allowed them and our teacher had stated that if we were caught with one it was a automatic fail so the next time we had a test i snuck a study guide in stacys desk and waited when the teacher came around to stacys desk she had found the study guide stacy tried to tell her it wasnt hers but the teacher wasnt having it she made her sit off to the side and failed her for the test stacy was crying and at the time i was laughing in my head do i feel bad about it now yes a bit
i intercepted a mobile phone call between two people and one happened to be someone i knew and she was talking about me

to be clear this was back when mobile phones were analogue and you could use a scanner to scan for calls and to be very clear i only did this twice and for a couple of minutes i felt guilty and realised it was an invasion of privacy and never did it after that

i was also young and stupid nowadays i take privacy extremely seriously
a few years ago i wanted to dye my black hair a lighter color however i knew my mom would never go for it and i didnt want to wait until i was  to do it i did some research and realized baking soda and hydrogen peroxide bleaches hair i went to my mom pretended that i suddenly got the idea that putting baking soda in my hair would have health benefits and convinced her to let me do it i mixed everything together my mom didnt know about the hydrogen peroxide and bleached my hair i knew that doing this went against my moms religious beliefs then i convinced my mom i was surprised about my hairs new color my mom told alot of people including professional hairstylists who shes friends with i have bleached my hair repeatedly since then and now she thinks that my natural hair has turned brown
im a nanny for a  month old baby my shifts are often ampm because the parents leave for work very early im super tired at this hour and the baby sleeps until  anyways i set alarms every  minutes and can always hear if the baby wakes up and is fussing im just so exhausted that time in the morning and have no energy to do anything with myself while the baby sleeps 

but i feel so guiltythe parents didnt say specifically whether or not i can sleep but something about it just feels wrong idk
when i was  i was at a christmas fair and there was these two boys messing on the skee ball thing climbing on it so i decided to pull a prank or to annoy them so i intentionally threw a ball at one of their private parts like in films either as a prank or to get them off on they said to my mother i did it on purpose but then i said i did not which is a lie cause i did do it on purpose 

xb

im  now and i feel really bad for the i did not know their ages but the were probably younger than me and i have traumatized them and ruined their life and it was my own fault with my shitty actions like i hope they are okay now and have gotten help as i did get help and no longer take part in this behavior but i still feel so awful for them that i did that and i do not care if i was also a kid i could have been older than them and i have responsibilities and i still deserve to be exposed by them for assaulting them years ago 
i have been diagnosed four years ago with ocd in particular related to contamination germs bacteria body fluids and pollutants 

i am particularly sensible to cigarette smoke it freaks me out and doesnt allow me to get any close to cigarette smokers 

my new roommate is a smoker and his room is next to mine i didnt know him but his look was quite bold he has piercings tattoos looks very tall and he gave ma an overall bad impression 

yesterday he wrote a message on our house chat group that he wouldnt be home and tonight i happened to not be able to sleep because of the terror that he might smoke in his room  through the window contaminating mine as well 

i decided to walk in his room knowing he wouldnt be there to check for any sign of him smoking inside his room but i found him still sleeping 

i pretended i suffer from sleepwalking and this allowed me to know him better turns out the dude is a super well educated guy who has a chemical engineering degree and offered himself to help me relax drink some water and get fresh air i apologised to him and gave him a lift to work as he doesnt have a car or a bike 

now i feel terrible cause i did something terrible to a genuinely nice guy and even pretended a illness i know sleepwalking isnt an illness and i feel like an immature douchebag who deserves absolutely no love from anyone 

i also feel disconnected to reality almost like irrational took control over my rational life i act nonsense im controlled by my contamination obsession every day for every single second of my life i need to put my clothes out of the room just in case some contaminants went into them i wash my hands multiple times per hour and i need to make my girlfriend follow strict rules in order to prevent my anxiety 

i feel hopeless
i had a great job doing delivery driving for a bakery in town and unfortunately i was also having trouble with my personal life so one particularly stressful night i was driving my usual route and the windshield was fogged and though the view was clearly not safe for driving i was not thinking clearly and drove anyway then i heard this loud bang and it turned out i had crashed into a cement light post i finished up and parked it so that you werent able to see the damage 
it took two days before anyone was able to notice the damage and by that time i was able to say that i had noticed it too as if i wasnt the cause nobody was punished and they continued like nothing happened
hi please delete this if this isnt suppose to be here

back when covid wasnt real i started a nonprofit for professional athletes to educate provide information and overall help their mental health well being of course this was the time when the nfl did not believe there was any issue with concussions ha
 
my cousin was the cofounder and we had teams interested in us had a board but we couldnt get enough funding to make it a functioning full time organization after  years of trying and a hundreds of my own dollars given to the government i decided to step down it is one of the most shameful and upsetting events in my life as i feel like ive failed not only myself but other people right after i stepped down i ended up getting back into therapy taking meds more seriously and being more proactive with using therapy techniques outside of my appointments 

i still fucking hate that i have bpd i hate mental illness and i hate that i have to deal with it forever waking up is a struggle but you gotta do it 
i wish i could help others with mental illness and be helpful and supportive but it always comes down to how can you help someone when you cant even help yourself
so i used to be in charge of all the vending machines at my old job that included ordering the stuff refilling the machine and collecting the money from it i never stole more than a few bucks at a time every item was priced below a dollar and i honestly dont feel all that bad about it 

like i feel bad because stealing is morally wrong but they also underpaid me and treated me like crap most of the time so i feel like it was somewhat justified 

anyway thats my confession its lame i know
throwaway account for obvious reasons lol i first started stealing my grandparents credit card for nintendo games when i was youngcouldnt live with mother and father grandparents had custodyi think over the time period of a year or  i had stolen about  i never had as much as other kids around me and i always felt below everyone so i wanted to have anything i could to keep up i used to ask for money all the timei could never learn how to make anythey kept me in the house religiously i was a bad kid who was smart as hell but wouldnt do work if i was paid too i also had a large amount of mental problems that i had acquired from the traumatic past with my parents and i didnt know how to handle it i used to act out in class constantly i had heavy adhd they prescribed me stimulants that had me like a zombie i hated them i never took them they put me in a residential program instead of working with me themself i always felt like my grandparentsparents didnt really care about me at all and just wanted the problemmeout their faces evidently at this point in time that wasnt the case 
 skip ahead a few years i start smoking weed at first it was just little carts with my friends in the neighborhood at this point in time i wasnt stealing anythingexcept some alcohol here and there however the more i smoked the more i wanted it i went into a haze next thing i know i sold my grandmas gold ring for some weed after this happened i got into a physical altercation with my grandfather and got put into a mental institution and even though this was definitely an understandable choice in hindsight in the moment i was completely blindsided betrayed and hurt i used to call them on the phone and they used to laugh at me and basically tell me thug it out some may call this tough love but when i got discharged i definitely left with a chip on my shoulder 
after that i was fine for a while of course but you know that didnt last forever next thing i know i stumble upon my grandfathers bedridden brothers bank account not gonna go into detail with what i did but i was able to take money out and withdraw it at the atms i told myself at first i wasnt gonna overdo it and at first i was able to do that but then the money got to my head and i went fucking crazy i stole upwards of  and spent it all on designer clothes shoes and weed weed weed 
for a while it was like that then the senior living company that was taking care of him checks bounced when they tried to take the money they worked for out and they saw what i had done fortunately i was able to cover my tracks and i never got caught or charged or anything but my family knew 
after that i was broke as shit  heavily addicted to weed my best option at this point was probably to stop smoking but you know i wasnt gonna do that i started stealing jewelry probably more than k they still dont know about the extents that of that though i just wanted to keep my high going on the inside doing all this stealing was ripping my heart up i felt absolutely horrible but for some reason my desire to escape overcame that my grandfather also died around this time it was very hard on me i was grieving for weeks how can i feel so bad for someone i hurt so much i asked myself i knew him my whole life he took me in out the kindness of his heart and i stabbed him in the back i felt and still feel absolutely horrible i started getting high more and more i had dabbled with harder drugs but i knew in my heart that weed was what i wanted so thats what i got i smoked about  backwoods a day for years shit i still smoke everyday i plan to stop very soon however 
now you would think hey hopefully this kid learnt his lesson and he wont try to do it again no no no no no i started stealing out their other bank accounts started finessing my grandmothers credit companies made her credit score go down  points took upwards of k in this phase after all this ive stopped stealing from them as i said i plan to stop smoking very soon and find a jobalthough every fucking job i apply for doesnt say shit back i dont want their forgiveness because i know i wont get it that fact tears me up inside but its something i had to accept ive literally watched my grandmother go from loving and adoring me to resenting and being disgusted with me and as i said i know ill probably never have that back i get my grandmother food and i help her out whenever i can even though it doesnt mean shit at this point but the thing is i can barely help her i need to get my self on track
okay before i lead you too much falsely off my clickbait title no i did not steal money from her or anything of too much significant value and when i took was rightfully mine now for the rest of the story

when i was in th grade i met my teacher will call her mrs puff mrs puff was an odd lady and she had this sort of reward system where if you were behaving or if you did your work well or if you did one of her other good behavior activities or were good in general she would give you these things called banana bucks and they had a picture of a monkey on them and they were made of paper and they were actually a pretty cool idea well the only thing with these banana bucks besides earning them through good behavior and good work was that you could only spend them twice a year which was a christmas time and at the end of the year on her prize shop she kept the shop on full display for us throughout the year to keep us encouraged to behave and i was already a very well behaved kid because of good parents at the time and i was a very good student as well and so these banana bucks ranged in denomination from      and  as you can imagine she did not hand out very many s but she handed them out to me because i was a very quiet kid probably at least once or twice a day i got banana bucks and i stuck them in my desk in a little baggie well eventually winter time came and she wanted us to spend them however i was trying to save them because there was a big prize that i wanted and while i probably could have afforded it then i wanted to get it at the end of the year as a treat for myself by the way the price costed  bucks the next highest prize was only  bucks anyway so when christmas rolled around i probably only spent  bucks on a little bit of candy and a little bit of small toys like a couple hot wheels or something and so i continued to save and at some point throughout the spring semester my bag became full so i shoved it to the back of my desk and started a new bag and when the end of the year came there were two prize days for the two last days of class and i couldnt find all of my money on the first day so i didnt spend it and on the second day however i did find my first bag and i counted it all up three times i had a million and a half banana bucks and i was ecstatic because not only could i buy the thing i really wanted which i believe was an rc boat or car but i could buy anything else i wanted in the shop probably the whole shop however once she realized what had happened she quickly gathered up my money told me that i could pick out three things from the shop but not the big prize and that that was my reward so i begrudgingly took three higherend prizes but i was pissed off so later that night i was stewing in my anger and i knew that i had to get back at her somehow but i didnt know how hey i didnt want to make it too obvious by doing something like stealing her purse first off cuz i would actually hurt her and second off because that would probably lead her straight to me on the plus side though she had really screwed herself over because she graded very harshly on kids for dumb things for instance she took  off a  test that i had simply because i forgot to write my name or the date i cant remember i can understand a couple points or  but  hell no so my mom quickly fixed that issue after a few instances along with a bunch of other parents who are having similar problems where the kids would be right but they wouldnt be right in her way i was also fortunate in that in the school i went to they were about  teachers kids and seven of them happened to be in my grade and a few more were in that part of the elementary and so while our moms were clearing out their stuff for the summer mrs puff was packing up her things not only to go in a storage but also to leave the school because she had not gotten her contract renewed so during one of the meetings that she had i recruited a couple of the kids to help me take all of the stuff from her prize store and hide it in different places throughout the school we were placed the empty boxes with some other stuff that weighed roughly the same amount of various school supplies and as far as i know she never reached back out to the school saying that her prize supply was stolen and over the next few days because its a week process to clear out the school i brought a duffel bag with some toys in it and made sure to bring home a candy and toys that i had rightfully gotten back as well as giving a cut to the kids who helped me out

i deserve whats coming but wanted to get some things off my chest this is looooong because ive never been honest about everything before

i was a smart kid growing up and lots of adults thought i had a lot of potential even in th grade and onwards when i started to struggle with getting homework done everyone viewed me as smart i would lie consistently about why i hadnt turned in certain assignments or why my teachers didnt receive them i went through high school without failing any classes thankfully but knew i could have done better

fast forward to college and things started off well great grades for the first semester then as things went on things got worse grades plummeted i stopped going to class because i was afraid of how people would view me lied to everyone about how i was doing i flunked out

fast forward to my first professional job outside of my failed attempt at college it was at a major organization that i had previously interned with and i lied about having graduated things started off well but then when it came time to do certain selfpaced tasksi just didnt do them i kept on telling myself oh i can do i later only later never came i eventually got diagnosed with adhd but it was too late my bosses found out i didnt do a major super important task that im supposed to do i tried lying and making excuses but i got fired 

fast forward to more recent times i finished my bachelors online which was awesome got a new job and even started a masters program new job and masters program started off greatbut you guessed it over time in my program i stopped doing my assignments as i was having such trouble motivating myself to get started and since i work from home i kept on telling myself i could do things later and would distract myself by playing video games or literally just staring at my phone endlessly scrolling now i have three incompletes from last semester that i need to finish within two weeks or i fail those classes i havent even started on those assignments but the worst part and what brings me to post is the situation at work now

once again i didnt do a super important task im expected to do once again i got caught and once again i lied and said i had done it and that there must have been a computer error basically i was supposed to monitor sales calls take notes and submit monitoring forms while i did do some monitoring i didnt do any of the forms and didnt take extensive notes the higher ups dont believe me my boss is gutted because shes advocated for me in the past but i think theyre still trying to give me some benefit of the doubt now they want copies of all my notes which i obviously dont have this gives me two options lie again and make up some notes and pretend i did everything i was supposed to or come clean about lying

i know option  is the right answer but when i got fired the first time my bf was so disappointed he wants to be with someone capable and driven im not being pessimistic when i say if i lost my job again he would break up with me i would have to tell everyone what a failure i am i might even have to drop out of my masters program because im barely making ends meet as it is all these pressures drove me to seriously consider suicide yesterday thankfully im a bit calmer now and i know i would never want to do that no matter how bad things get

im so scared so ashamed and so disgusted with myself ive been telling everyone that im okay and just lying my parents will be so disappointed sorry i know this was long

update also am i supposed to edit my post to provide an update im not on reddit much so i dont know


thank you for all of your comments seriously i really appreciated the wide variety of responses when i wrote this post i was leaning towards making up the notes but upon reading your comments i reflected and realized that if anything were to change i needed to be honest with myself and others and face the consequences whatever they may be

i wrote a long email to my boss outlining all that ive been struggling with and told them that i hadnt done the monitoring and trapped myself in a lie i told them that i would do whatever it takes to rebuild trust but that i understand if i needed to be terminated i expressed my gratitude for their support and apologized for failing when they have advocated for me so much

once i sent the email it was a weird mixture of emotions i was obviously super nervous not sure what would happen but it was also freeing it felt good to just send the email and get it out there that im not okay

didnt hear from my boss for a full day until i got invited to a call with them and hr i was expecting the worst but im so happy to say that i was not terminated im going on a pip which is honestly exactly what i could use im so so grateful one thing that helped was that ive succeed in many other aspects of my job even if i had been terminated though i know i would have done the right thing by coming clean it was the only way to potentially break the pattern

in terms of the recommendations i am on medication but had only just started seeing a therapist we only had one session prior to my post i dont take medication all the time because of how it affects my appetite but im definitely more productive when taking it i think a lot of you are spot on though in that this is more than just adhd and my therapist has since recommended antidepressants since i came clean ive been on a roll with productivity i even worked out but of course the real challenge is keeping it up im also going to drop out of one of my classes for my masters program this will delay my graduation for a full year because of prerequisite stuff im going to talk to my parents tonight and be honest with them about how im feeling i already told them that i wasnt feeling great and theyre worried about me

the hardest step coming up is actually finishing my incompletes as well as telling my bf that im delaying graduating by a year i think that will be a real test to see if im actually on the right track or just getting a temporary boost from being honest and not being terminated i started the app habatica and its been helpful for the past couple of days ill try to update again at the end of the month to let yall know how that went

i know other people said that theyre also in similar situations lying to themselves and others i highly highly recommend coming clean i dont know if this will lead to lasting change but at least right now i can say that i hope and believe it will and now there are people who know what im struggling with and are even willing to provide support i was incredibly lucky in how my company reacted but even if i had been fired the only way i think i would actually change is by starting to be authentic and honest with myself and others regardless of the consequences

thanks yall
im a th semester student of an uni in europe but i only finished the courses of the st semester but i lied to everyone that im about to finish and that i could finish earlier if it wasnt for covid its yes and no because of covid its no because it was me who was lazy and didnt do all the work its also because of covid that i didnt make any friends at the uni since we all studied only and didnt even see each other faces  years of online and when the rd year came somehow everyone seemed to know each other already i was all frustrated and didnt pay attention to the courses and leading them to failure now i really wanted to graduate but it was overwhelming with all the courses and the lies i made i cant get out now
im a horrible father
when i was  my grandma took my cousins sisters and everyone out to wendys for lunch i ordered my burger with no tomatoes because i dont and didnt like tomatoes and then i went to get ketchup for my fries and my grandma said you know ketchup has tomatoes in it correct from that day forward i have everyone convinced i dont like ketchup and i even had myself convinced up until the other day when the memory played through my head again and i realized i was just gaslighting everyone kinda funny kinda not i feel bad to an extend because everyone who knows me thinks i dont like ketchup but the reality of it is i did and probably still do  i havent eaten ketchup since that day and for the sake of  year old me i will continue to refuse to eat ketchup because i gotta admire the dedication
i was abroad and had gotten extremely sick i came home with black diarrhea i think i had a parasite  and was throwing up while i was driving i had to stop at a gas station to relieve myself i had never shit so much i literally covered the entire toilet with shit it was on the floor on the wall and  all over the seat i was so ashamed of myself i didnt know what to do so i ran when i was leaving i heard someone scream i think it was the gas station employee i feel bad as the gas station employee had to clean up my mess that is my confession i also confess that i dont want my boyfriend to see this as he would be disgusted with me 
my family was secretly well off because my parents were dealers my needs were usually met but when my sister was born they started neglecting us both and hid it well from early infancy on i would put my sister in my bed at night with me because i didnt trust all their friends and customers being around her at odd hours of the night i now feel bad about that because i know cosleeping can be dangerous but i didnt know it back then i made her bottles brushed her hair and changed her diapers a lot even though i was only  when she was born

since my parents didnt keep my old clothes and they didnt pay enough attention to get her new clothes when she needed them i would go into stores and steal clothes and shoes ironically when my parents caught on id get disciplined and yet this cycle continued until we were placed with my grandmother when i was  or  probably  of her clothes were stolen by me i also stole clothes for myself and eventually got caught a whole  years after i started 

i look back on how many times i stole and am kind of impressed at how good i got though im not proud of it i know that sounds contradictory
this happened in my history class we were given an assignment on the computer i wasnt working on it and i was doing other things and going on different websites my teacher told me to come to her desk and bring my laptop so i went over to her and she said youre just staring at the computer screen what have you been doing this entire time time she went to my history there were was  recent websites i visited one was a shopping website other was youtube and the other  were to other websites and then the th thing i googled i know this is cringe but i googled hot pecsabs

 when she saw that google search she gave the computer a weird look and then she told me okay dont look that stuff up get started on the assignment and what makes this funny is that you can tell she was about to say something about it but then she decided to leave it alone
when i was  i was in the uttp group and i was trolling then they started to send me violent videos of my character being shot and killed and then i uploaded the scene from gta  where trevor gets burned alive then they sent me more gore from cartoonsmovies and video games so i send them gore i have left the uttp and auttp but now i feel really bad cause i sent gore to kids and women and mostly disturbing and traumatizing them for life and really its all my fault i know i was young and they started but i should have known better about sending and this is not a mistake i have hurt people over this women and kids are mostly innocent and are more sensitive and disturbed by this type of content and i feel horrible for them i hope they are okay and have gotten help as for me i ruined my life im a child and women abuser and really i deserve the karma that will hit me cause its my fault
its not my freaking kink i swear i know i was being a pervert in this whole story but here we go during my sophomore year around  i m had a crush one of my friend of friend m he was a very charming guy and hes definitely not gay i somehow befriended him by befriending i mean being friends as man to man he didnt even have a slight idea that i was gay at the time although i am gay but i showed no sign of femininity he was kinda gay phobic i used to go to his room and he use to go around naked in his room i swear to god i couldnt take my eyes off his thingy but i kept on complimenting it to him like nice cock bro he usually laughed and shrugged it off i had no balls to tell him i loved him cuz you know he was kinda gay phobic

one day during junior college we were on a planned picnic with other friends on a small mountain not far from town we had some drinking but i wasnt a big drinker he was kinda intoxicated and i was sober as i saw him leaving for peeing behind the bush i put my hand on his shoulder and we went to pee yes seeing his ding dong turned me on and i faked texting with my friend and asked him to go back before me after he left the bush the god of horniness struck me with his power and i licked his urine which splattered on the leaves it is disgusting i know what you think i had never done that before it wasnt and isnt my kink and i dont know what got into me my soul left my body when i heard a call near from my back what are you doing i was stunned i somehow found a good answer i just feel like vomiting i am not a good drinker the guy friend of the guy i had a crush on laughed and said yeah i understand and he peed 

we are now graduated and hes now back to his hometown miles away from mine i still regret what i did that day i was and still is so ashamed of myself 

is it wrong to do this

edit he was single at the time and he was obsessed with body building 

edit  ive never watched saltburn before i heard of the title but i never heard the storyline
i stole an air purifier from walmart even the small ones for a bedroom are really expensive my dog was born with heart problems and he just turned  hes been on medicine for over almost  years now and theyve upped his medicine twice in a year his cough recently has gotten really bad i have an appointment for the vet in like  weeks i looked up some ways to help his cough besides all the medicine hes already on and to rid the lungs of fluid is to improve the over all air quality so i already have a small humidifier to help loosen the mucus but i needed an air purifier i just wanted a small one for my bedroom to see if it helps but the smallest one i could find at wally world was like  ive been feeling really guilty but his cough has just been getting worse and i cant move up the appointment but i couldnt afford the purifier and im really hoping it helps

its just boring now theres no rush
hey everyone
this is my first reddit post ever but i just need to get something off of my chest 
i graduated from high school in  and attended a college that i was not super excited to go to in the middle of covid needless to say the pairing of already not being super stoked to be a student at this college along with being in a weird mental state because of the state of the world at the time made motivation extremely hard to come by in my first year i was academically disqualified from that school i was put on a program called open university which would have given me the opportunity to continue attending school there if i had gone through with it however i did little to no research on what that actually meant and just took it as i was kicked out of the school 
i kept this information from my parents and my friends and just told them that i was not going to be attending that school anymore because i was not able to find housing for the following year 
so the next year i started attending a local community college and again needless to say the combination of attending a school that i was even less stoked to be going to paired with being in the worst year for my mental state in my life made finding motivation hard i barely signed up for any classes because i did not put any research into what i needed to take and even then i ended up failing most of them 
however i couldnt let my friends know that i felt like a complete failure and that summer summer  i lied to all of my friends and told them that i was going to be transferring to a state university with a good reputation in the fall and that i would be living with one of my old friends who attended the school and come fall  when i obviously would not be attending the school with said reputation i just told my friends that the housing situation with my old friend didnt work out and i would have to be commuting to school another lie 
similar story for the  school year no research terrible mental state only a few classes and still failed most of them all while telling my friends that i had good grades and was doing great in life because my ego would not let me admit that i was a fraud and a failure and since i was still not attending this state school i told everyone that i was at i had to come up with another lie as to why i was still at home all i could come up with was that i was going to be living with another friend which did not work out come fall  either creative i know 
come the  school year same situation no research terrible mental state only a few classes still failed most of them however i also began to date this girl that i knew from high school this girl was a friend of mine that i kept in contact with since we graduated high school so she was aware of the well call itunlucky situations that i was in regarding college housing i knew that in order to have a healthy relationship i would need to confess all of my lies about my situation to her come clean about my lies and tell her that i was a fraud however i was scared that she would view me as a failure and being my first real relationship that scared me so i did not tell her and instead doubled down the lie like i did to all of my close friends and people that care about me come summer  i needed yet another lie to explain why i was not going to be attending this state school that i told all of my friends that i was in so i told everyone that i was taking a gap year to pursue and internship that is associated with my major and desired career path i knew that this was wrong but for some reason qualified the lie by telling myself that i would get into the state school that i already told my friends i was attending come fall  so everything would work out okay 
well here i am heading into spring  college apps sent in a couple of months ago fall  with a  cumulative gpa no chance of getting into any of the  schools that i applied to come fall  and still laying on a bed of lies that my friends and girlfriend believe because why wouldnt they on top of this i had been lying to my parents saying that my grades were good these past couple of years how could i tell them that i was basically flushing their money down the drain these past couple of years i have no chance of transferring to a school next year i will be on my fourth year of a two year college 

i really do not know what to do ive thought about coming clean to my friends and girlfriend i just cant bring myself to do it these people mean a lot to me and i feel like coming clean to everyone would only end with me being alone that everyone would leave me and why wouldnt they they would have no reason to trust me i have been lying to them for over  years now im too scared to tell them what a failure i truly am especially my girlfriend who i really love ive thought about coming clean to my parents about the fact that i have been wasting their hard earned money i do not know what to do i know the answer is obvious and i just need to shape up and figure my shit out and i have started taking those steps into being the person that i have lied about being all of these years but i dont know how approach this to my friends or family do i quadruple down on the lie i seriously cannot imagine a situation where i come completely clean about this and still keep my friends and relationship in tact 

if anyone has any advice either on this situation or on help with the school transfer process that would be more than greatly appreciated 

tldr im failing community college and have been lying to everyone in my life about attending a state school and need help trying to find a resolution
this morning i got spun but it wasnt enough so i grabbed bux and took some out n out money in i know someone saw me do it it was a very dear friend of mine used to be at least either them or i have been abused by this dope just as much we abuse it rightfully so i am scared cuz i know we all know that guy is gonna come around searching for it rest assured i cant lie outta this one idk what to expect honestly i pray for it to be some thing in regards to a monetary penance although im already on one i think 
weird strange situations aside i am entirely at fault for this regretful tweaker attitude yes im a junkie yes i dont like it but i just didnt think beyond my action when i went to that sack

so to you guy with the mission im very fucking sorry i know just recently ive been misled about recurring themes like this one idk what id have to accomplish to make it rightsatisfactory any one else whom ive made uncomfortable regarding such activity is also welcome to gripe to their merry pleasure 
thank you for reading plz lets not let this define me entirely i picked a hell of a week to quit drinking
many years ago i was working a job as an assistant at a private school there was a little boy there with major behavior problems kicking cussing being destructive etc i was at my wits end trying to keep the other kids safe and the classroom peaceful when he got out of control i used to hold his hand but hed yank and fight it like crazy eventually i used a trick my dad had taught me and held his hand by the fleshy part just above the wrist bone because it was painful for him when i held him tighter he stopped pulling additionally i held him by the ear to accomplish the same thing and put my hand on his cheeks to get him to look at me when i was talking there were two other children i was rough with too i also put my hand on their faces to make them look at me when i was talking

i hate myself for what i did it was so so wrong he needed help they all needed a grownup that was in control i grew up in a family where being rough was the norm i thought it was normal at the time the way i treated him after all i would see kids pulled by the ear all the time in cartoons god im stupid i still work with kids and im often praised for how patient i am i feel like im the only one who knows im a monster part of me feels like i should quit and find another profession that i dont belong anywhere near children this is my deepest darkest secret and im incredibly ashamed i try to tell myself that it wasnt abusive because i didnt leave marks but i know thats bullshit

edit for some context no im not rough with kids anymore the little boy went to an administrator to share what i was doing i got a talking to from the principal and i never did it again if i have one strength its never needing to be told the same thing twice 

it seems like i intensified fear in people about leaving their children in childcare i can say with certainty that i am an aberration if i was saved by one thing its the many talented and compassionate people ive been fortunate enough to work with im sorry to create distrust that wasnt my intention you have tools and open communication is the sharpest one of the best things about my story is that it was a very brief time between when i started behaving roughly and when i was caught 

it seems theres a solid minority of you who dont believe people can change right now i dont know whether i agree or disagree part of me feels tainted thats the part that wants to quit and never look back the other parts of me though they have a lot to give 
i could be writing this on a burner account but im too lazy to switch and honestly dont care about what anyone thinks or says about me anymore ive heard it all i had my first beer in march of  when i was  and things went totally downhill from there at first i drank just with my buddies at parties but in june i started drinking  beers every other day and sometimes many more i think that the main reason i consumed alcohol was because i was too afraid to talk to anyone about how life and school was id just bottle up my emotions and drink away the pain ive been sober for  months now and i just cant help but feel disgusted by what i did in the past i knew it was wrong but felt that it was the only way to cope
when was around  i pulled the fire alarm at my local piggly wigglys the fire department came and my parents rushed out of there with me
dont judge me i had to go and couldnt make it to the door  i feel bad for whoever picks it up
i was a introvert quiet known to be well behaved type of kid i was in the after school program and one day when i was wandering about on my own i came across this small red box on a wall that said press here i already knew i wasnt allowed to touch it because wed all been given stern instructions earlier that month not to touch it but somehow i still managed to convince myself that clearly im supposed to press it because thats what it says

i think you know where this is going alarm went off chaos erupted i realised my mistake teachers were running and children were crying i quickly stepped away from the wall and put on a fake confused face the fire brigade showed up a teacher even stopped to ask me if i saw who did it never thinking it could have been the innocent good kid 

another kid got in trouble for doing it and the school tried to charge his parents the  fine of the fire trucks beeing called out on a false alarm in the end they had to drop the fine because the other kid kept denying he did it 

because of the possibility of my parents getting fined and me getting in trouble i never told anyone im  now and still scared to tell them lol
i bought a projector that was stolen from my  high school after graduation it had property of high school name on it so i used some paint remover 
a buddy of mine stole it and got paranoid about it and sold it to me for  bucks back in  its  and it still works had to replace the bulb back in 
i used to live on an army base about  years ago my best friend her husband  and i had went out and they invited some people back to her house after the bars closed one guy in the army was very inebriated he said something so rude to my best friend that it made me so mad he later passed out on her couch i went in the bathroom and found a bottle of red nail polish and proceeded to paint his eyebrows red his nose and around his mouth  we then set an alarm to go off  minutes later we convinced him it was am almost time for work it was actually am he got up and left and by sheer dumb luck he didnt have a rear view mirror it turned out that he went to the barracks and passed out then when he actually had to get up  he simply threw on his uniform then went to stand at attention with his platoon for an inspection he didnt understand why people were calling him bozo until the platoon sergeant berated him in front of his entire platoon for having a clown face he was then told to get that sht off his face he had to go buy nail polish remover but unfortunately for him he couldnt get the nail polish off of his eyebrows he ended up having to shave them off my friends husband was in the guys platoon and saw all of this happening he came back and told us all about it the next time we went out he saw us and came up to us being very nice he even offered to buy us each a drink we politely refused we started calling him halfbrow after that we always watched our backs around halfbrow  i do feel bad about the fact that we had him drive back to the barracks inebriated we didnt really think that part through 
we had this jar in th grade full of pencils that anyone could use when they needed a pencil and i took one and chewed every bit of the pencil to the point that it looked like freddy krueger but as a pencil actually worse it was just mangled shreds you could not even make it out as a pencil it shouldnt have legally counted as a pencil it looked like it had been through every world war it was gruesome to look at i then stuck it back in the jar of pencils ready for some children to use the mangled pencil but the teacher found it before any of the kids did and she lined us all up and tried to force a confession out of whoever the horrible monster that mutilated the pencil was she was infuriated especially that this incident should occur at our big age i did not confess i stood my ground to this day no one but  people in that class knows im the one who stuck the terrifyingly mutilated pencil back in the jar for everyone to enjoy
so i was young and dumb and going through a rough time financially i had a job as a manager at a college campus restaurant most of the workers were students including foreign exchange students that were sometimes unfamiliar with the american currencymeaning there were often a lot of errors especially at times when a new round of students would come in from semester to semester every night the manager me took out the drawers and went to the office to count it idiotically the office did not have any security cameras and you can guess how easy it was to fudge a few dollars here and there im normally a very trustworthy person  and i regret being desperate enough to do that
i used to volunteer at the cafeteria at my junior high at lunch time and i was often the person handling the cash there was always a teacher doing it with us but every time shed look away i would take a  bill and put it in my pocket the first time i did it i only took maybe  but eventually it got to the point where i was taking at least  a day the money never went to anything useful but it was more the thrill of not being caught i never told anyone about this and im embarrassed about it i dont understand how they didnt catch me considering they bought lunches from places like edo and subway and im sure they wouldve noticed they werent making that money back but somehow i never got caught
my sister would get food delivered to us in a back pack for not well off families it would contain dried goods as well as a couple canned goods as that is what the child could carry all three of us kids loved when they sent chocolate milk cartons they were the best treat we had  my fault in this was when the school year was over and we got our last bag of goods i kept the back pack mom and dad wouldnt have been able to buy me a backpack for school the whole  years i was at high school the next year my sister in elementary got the food in a back pack they had numbered the backpack very clearly in sharpie i feel so guilty i used that backpack all four years of high school and i stole it
im long gone from this job so i can finally get this off of my chest 

i f used to work at a very large corporate convenient storegas station i was working there around the age of  to  i hated working there so badly i loved to work but that job was so stressful it got tiring the only thing that was worth it was the fact that i was getting paid weekly instead of biweekly the checks were what was keeping me around

the managers were creeps and definitely held favoritism with their own mostly when it came to race and family as well i got hired because they needed serious help i was looking for a job in the area by any means and decided to give it a shot the job had a detailed description as to what id specifically be doing and after months of doing that maybe about three they eventually had me running the whole store which believe it or not can get pretty hectic when its just one person there or another person slacking off it wasnt apart of the job description deal but i had decided to put up with it anyway 

the main problem was that the customers were horrible everyone had attitudes would take their anger out on me or even tried to fight me behind the counter im not the type of person to back down so unfortunately i would entertain the negative energy and even try to fight back i was young immature and wasnt the type to ignore or allow disrespect 

eventually due time it did get to the point where i had decided the money wasnt enough to stay but instead of leaving i got the idea to steal so i had came up with this plan being that i had access to the whole store i was mainly in charge of being on the register so i had access to checking out the customers who wanted to purchase items what i did was only possible with cash so unfortunately if a rude customer was paying card i had no choice but to let them get away with it now if a rude customer was paying cash i would give them their change back just short the way our register was organized it had it so that there was an extra slot that was kept empty i would give the customer back their change a dollar or even two short and put that in the empty slot then at the end of the shift when it was time for me to count the money for store totals i would keep the money i took from the customers and make sure everything added up and that there wasnt too little or too much so that counts would match up

it might not seem like much but one to two dollars can add up due time i would work ten hour shifts and get so many rude customers by the end of my shift i had as much money as an average waitress could make through tips at least fifty dollars a day i worked almost every day of the week too including weekends so you can do the math

long story short i was making extra money on top of the weekly checks i was already getting but unfortunately it was out of an inconvenience of a rude customer and something completely illegal 

dont be rude to retail workers and definitely count to make sure you have all your change

my dog rizzo had turned two in october  a few weeks ago she had some reverse sneezing fits that were alarming but they didnt happen often and then they stopped  the week before things got really bad she had a runny nose  it started off clear and then turned a bit more thickmucousy  otherwise she was herself  high appetite long walks playing tug of war just a day before she bottomed out  

i remember starting to get concerned about the runny nose  it was most apparent in the evenings when she would sit beside me on a chair in the office  a string of goo would come out and i would need to wipe her nose  but i didnt take her to the vet

i thought it would pass  i was distracted trying to get my car back from the shop waiting to hear on a new job offer hiking to the pharmacy to get my own uti meds in the middle of an ice storm and preparing to move across town on a deadline  

but last friday night she bottomed out  i had her at a boarding facility for the night because movers were supposed to have shown up early the next day and i wanted her to play and have fun over there rather than be stressed with strangers in and out of the house  i figured it was safe to let her go to boarding because she had no other symptoms no coughing no eye discharge no loss of appetiteenergy or anything that would indicate anything serious or contagious

pm that night the manager called me and asked me to pick rizzo up and take her to an emergency vet  she suddenly couldnt walk very well  her eyes were drooping and blood shot and she looked disoriented  the vet did chestneckhead xrays all of which came back clear  her blood work came back normal  they felt a swollen lymph node under her chin and when they tested the fluid they found fungal cells that they didnt immediately recognize  they sent those off to testing and sent me home with two different antibiotics an antifungal and a pain medication for her  

four days later we got results confirming that she had cryptococcosis a rare fungal infection that in dogs that often begins in the nose and progresses rapidly toward the central nervous system  we started intense iv antifungal treatment and iv fluids but she only made it to saturday morning  

i keep picturing those moments when i wiped her nose and thought this is weird but i cant take her to the vet right now  after the move  maybe it will go away on its own  

there was one night i did hear her sniffling out on the couch and brought her into the bed with me  

so it was probably a week and a half or so of noticeable symptoms before she completely bottomed out  i just kept waiting for some reason  

i let her slide down my priorities list in the exact time she needed me to prioritize her  
there was definitely a dent not a big dent but a dent i feel bad but the owners werent home and there was construction equipment anyway so the workers couldve done it i swear i was like the imposter on among us where i just drive away quickly onto the main street so its impossible i was there when it happened i know it sounds horrible but if nobody was there then nobody knows what happened and im the only one who knows so bam
a few years ago i walked into my classroom in the morning i had been recently upset due to a relationship problem and my eyes were red from crying my teacher whom i was much fond of approached me to ask why i hadnt handed in a huge assignment that had been due on that day frantically not wanting to disappoint my teacher or bring down my grades i decided to use my puffy eyes to my advantage the first thing i could come up with was my dad might have lung cancer i just found out my teachers harsh expression immediately melted into a sympathetic smile she told me i could get as much time as i needed and i thanked her from that day until i graduated the year said teacher was constantly asking me about my family situation and i felt so heavily guilty about having lied about such a serious matter just to get out of doing work
when i was a kid around the age of  or  i found myself captivated by the world of pokmon the colorful creatures and their battles captured my imagination and i quickly became obsessed with the card game that accompanied the franchise in a town in virginia i discovered a local bookstore that housed a passionate fan base for all things pokmon little did i know this would be the beginning of a journey filled with deception greed and ultimately redemption 

at first it was innocent enough my cousin and i would frequent the bookstore spending our afternoons discussing strategy trading cards and making new friends within the community we were young and impressionable and we quickly became addicted to the thrill of acquiring rare and valuable pokmon cards as time went on however our hunger for the most soughtafter cards began to outweigh our sense of morality we started to realize that we could use our charm and knowledge of the game to manipulate others into trading their valuable cards with us after all these kids from rural virginia had no idea what was actually worth on the collectible market and they were eager to get their hands on any rare cards they could find my cousin and i would show up at local tournaments and events always dressed in our best pokmon gear ready to impress we would make friends with the other kids learning about their most prized possessions and which cards they were after then we would subtly drop hints about our own rare and valuable cards sparking jealousy and desire within our unsuspecting targets once we had them hooked we would make an offer that was too good to refuse we would tell them about a rare card or shiny pokmon that we supposedly owned and that we were willing to trade for their precious card the other kids would be so excited at the prospect of obtaining such a valuable item they would often accept our offers without even questioning the authenticity of our cards with the help of my cousin we had access to a bodega in new york city that sold fake pokmon cards for a fraction of their real value we would buy these fake cards by the dozens bringing them back to virginia to trade with the unsuspecting victims

we never got caught or in any kind of trouble my pokmon card collection is well over 

as i grew older i began to see the error in my ways i realized that i had not only taken advantage of others but had also betrayed the very community that had initially brought me so much joy the thrill of the scam had clouded my judgment and i had lost sight of what truly mattered in life
now i say that i only smoke weed but i am high  i cannot stand being sober and that is so hard to admit to anyone i abused narcotics and xanax for years then i went on a  month drinking binge after my mom died suddenly i developed pancreatitis and had to have my gallbladder removed from that binge now i just smoke or should i say vape all the time i am bipolar and have severe anxiety attacks my meds are pretty good for it but weed just makes it even better i know i need to go into treatment just not ready yet and i smoke cigarettes newports and now i am developing copd ugh  
this happened about  years and some change ago i was  at the time im  now trying to turn my life around but this was one of the many times ive committed a robbery with my brother but one of the only times ive genuinely reflected and felt terrible because of the circumstances growing up we had nothing we both had problems with drugs and we had to sell drugs and rob to be able to afford food for ourselves otherwise it was raw spaghetti noodles or crackers and sometimes even drinking condiments just to stop the awful hunger pains me and my brother had been buying weed from this dude for about a year our former plug got arrested he was about  years old or so and one day he tried to seriously tax me and my brother asking full  off the smack for a pound on what we thought was gonna be mid grade shit when me and my brother started off getting fronts and only having to pay back  to  per pound because we were buying in large amounts to sell this made me extremely angry and i told my brother to tell him we wanted  pounds and that we were gonna jack him naturally we had guns when you sell drugs as your primary source of income and lived where we lived you were a idiot if you aint have one anyway we stopped by his house he was going out of state for a few days and had just left the store so we had him pull up to his house to grab our shit and do the diddy in his car he wanted us to get in his car the usual routine me and my brother step in i had a glock x tucked in my pants under my hoodie and my brother had his little  pistol the plug was in the drivers seat and his old lady in the passenger we had been buying from him for so long that he trusted us and didnt usually carry his strap when we would come through this day he didnt have it he turned around and smiled at us and said this stuff he had was new and that he wanted us to smell it he literally threw one of the pounds in my lap and me and my brother smelled it the dude took a deep breath in and he sighed then proceeded to talk about how his girl was pregnant and that his other child had just been diagnosed with lukemia and apologized for the prices and that hed make it right for us in the future when he was done talking about all that stuff he started thanking us for listening to him i started feeling so terrible and like there was a ball in my stomach it got silent for a second then he started to say something else but before he was able to say anything else and make what i was about to do hurt worse i tapped my brother and we both drew down on them i remember every word he said and what i said like it was yesterday i said im sorry dawg but i need that please just give it to me and everythings gonna be straight tears started rolling down this mans face and he literally just sighed with the most blank look on his face then he chuckled in the most empty way and said you know what of course bro take it you need it more than me threw it in the back seat without moving his blank gaze and it took everything in my body not to shed a tear his girl was screaming and crying in one of the most ear piercing ways ive heard someone cry before and begging us not to do anything that would harm her child and telling us that we were pieces of shit for doing what we were doing me and my brother said nothing but i glanced over at him and i could tell by the look on his face he felt exactly how i was feeling i motioned my head towards my car then we ran to my car and i drove off as fast as i could before he could go inside and get his gun me and my brother looked at each other after about  minutes of silence and i said that shit made me feel terrible dawg and he said i know but my name we cant just fucking starve then as a young adult i finally understood how shitty and cut throat our world was and it made my heart hurt we got home and went about our business sold the stuff never mentioned it again but it still hurts to this day knowing i probably seriously impacted that man and his family as well as his financial situation who all needed him please dont do this shit it sounds good in the music but that life really is rough and it never turns out good thanks for listening
when i was in highschool i had this friend well call him ryan ryan was my age he was outwardly gay this is before gay marriage was legalized we also lived in a small conservative town ryan and i werent super close in fact we didnt talk outside of school i was just chill with him especially since he was dating a guy i had been friends with for awhile 

we met in class in th grade he had been getting bullied for liking anime at the time i hid the fact i liked anime from my friends but seeing him get bullied for it like i used to ticked me off and i stood up and argued with his bullies from that point on we became friends 

although we didnt speak a lot during the th grade ryan would come to my math class to see his boyfriend i sat in close proximity to his boyfriend and wed all make idle conversation ryan was a very excitable guy hyper but incredibly witty 

sometime in th grade his family got stationed out of state he was a military brat so before him and i got close he moved across the country id ask his boyfriend how he was and from what i heard he was doing fine 

shortly after he moved i got a friend request on facebook from a jake confused i didnt respond to it that is until ryans boyfriend informed me that jake was ryans secret facebook acc since his parents didnt allow him social media knowing that i added him back 

at this point ryan had begun to reach out to me through this facebook acc at first it was minor nothing of note a few comments here and there on my posts nothing youd really respond to then hed begun to message me id reply here and there but i was never one to use fb messenger much so i tended to be bad at responding this lead me to miss a handful of his messages reaching out to say hi im not gonna lie i mightve also ignored some on purpose just not feeling up to responding 

it wasnt a big deal to me at the time we werent close in the slightest ryan had never texted me before this point either i figured he was just bored since he was new to his school i figured hed text his boyfriend if i didnt reply or at least one of his other friends from my school

apparently ryan and his boyfriend my friend broke up they agreed the distance was too hard to maintain in highschool they even agreed to try to find each other after hs as for his other friends from my school he had reached out to them but no one responded not sure why compared to me his other friends were super close with him 

i feel the need to emphasize that while i did consider him a friend we hardly talked even prior to his move 

one day toward the end of th grade im sitting in the class ryan and i met in a layered class when the teacher comes in with a grim look on his face he says he has an announcement for us ryan has died he committed xxx last night his mother had called the teachers to tell them to let us know so we could attend his funeral 

apparently after ryan had moved he was never able to make new friends at his new school in fact it was quite the opposite actually he had begun to get bullied quite harshly ryan and his family had moved to an even more conservative town in the deep south so he was one of a few poc and gay people in the town i dont know to what extent he was bullied but from what his ex boyfriend knew it was brutal 

i felt and still feel immense guilt about this ryan had reached out to me after all and i ignored him i never wouldve had i known what he was going through what if i couldve said something to prevent him from doing what he did almost  years later and this still haunts me 

i didnt attend his funeral because i felt i had no right to look his mother in the face and pretend him and i were super close pretend i didnt ignore him 

im  now and i still have the messages on fb messenger of when he reached out i occasionally look at them i wish i wouldve just responded even if it wouldnt have changed anything i still wish i wouldve im sorry ryan

edit i really appreciate all the kind words ive been receiving in the comments its definitely something im trying to move past originally when it all happen i tried to ignore it but it would come back in my mind every few months still at times does especially since despite being  at the time i had already talked various other people down from committing i felt like i let him down for not being there 

ryan was one of the first queer friends i had growing up and unfortunately didnt live to see me come out myself but he definitely was apart of my journey and he always will be

im  years old and have always been that studious rule following daughter my parents expected me to be a while ago my parents bought a new house and we are still in the process of moving my parents and brothers live in the new house and i remained in the old after a month of temporarily living alone i had a random urge to see if they left their alcohol in the alcohol cabinet
to my surprise i ended up giving into the urge of wanting to experience what being drunk was like that same night a week later i did it again and the cycle started all my friends had moved away to university and they were getting drunk too i felt like i was just being a typical teenager because of that

when i threw up and blacked out for the first time i started to question just how much i was drinking the alcohol in the cabinet was disappearing slowly and i began to experience the shame and stress that keeps you up at night i filled a bottle up with water which came with instant regret if they ever drank from that bottle they would know
 i have strict parents and whenever they came to the old house to grab more belongings to transfer to the new my fear they would open the cabinet and find alcohol missing gnawed at me 
i was breaking out from stress and i didnt want them to see what kind of daughter i was behind the scenes so i gave into this awful fear and told my mom a halftruth that i had drank myself asleep once and filled the bottle up with water after
because i confessed the truth i was forgiven my dad went through the liquor cabinet soon after which brings me to the root of my new problem i never stopped sure i had quit for a month but i quickly finished three more bottles that are now hiding in my room for a fear they will find them in the garbage a lot of bottles are a lot lower in liquor than they were when my dad checked and a lot missing too obviously 
im not sure when they will go through the cabinet again but if they realize something isnt right they will go through every journal app text message device to try and figure out why i did it i obviously will never be allowed by myself i will lose the privilege of having a space of my own i think i screwed up lollll
so in my algebra class there is this guy i sit next to it started off just like any other day and class just started and the teacher hasnt gone up to the board and started teaching the guy next to me i happened to glance at his computer and saw him looking at something inappropriate he was scrolling through photos  of gay men and i saw a one photo of two men holding hands and they had a condom in the middle another photo i saw there were two men were on top of each other on one of the images he clicked on it had a article that talked about sex just from where i was sitting it made me feel pretty uncomfortable when class ended i went up and told the teacher about what happened and what i saw and then i left to find the principal and report it

i told him exactly what i told the teacher and what he was looking at and then i said what he was looking at one his computer made me feel uncomfortable and then he said he was going to check it out
when i was maybe  or  i would go to the skatepark almost every day and bmx or skate i got really good at it and the positive is that biking is still a big part of my life and fitness the negative was that my friends were bad influences and wreaking havoc on the public when we were outside the walls of the skatepark was a favorite past time of ours 

one day i had a few friends in my old toyota truck and i remember we were trying to score some beer and driving thru neighborhoods around the skatepark we frequented bay area i was driving and it was trash day so everyone had their trash bins in the street i was an idiot and craved attention so when i saw what looked like a father and son jogging together it clicked in my head that if i sped past them i could create a scene if i drove my truck into the trash bins of a random house i went by the joggers and careened into three trash bins at once i was going fairly quick dented my bumper and the bins went flying pretty sure i broke them and rendered them useless where would someone even get new ones im such a dick i looked in the rear view and ill always remember the father of the two joggers having just seen what id done raise his arms in an exasperated and angry expression then he and his son picked up the trash bins they were probably their own bins or maybe their neighbors 

i drove off laughing feeing the adrenaline of being the biggest asshole of my friends ive changed a lot since then now m but i feel terrible for it if i saw that now as a grown man i would be so confused and furious
i have slowly started a habit of stealing wine  glasses beer glasses or coffee mugs from different places when im traveling or think i wont come back only one per place and only when i like the logo they have or really like the place i keep them kinda as memories of the trip
i dont know why but i tend to eavesdrop on the conversations that my  friends who i consider them close but we arent friends anymore have because i always feel like they are talking about me even if i am a  sure that they arent they have done it before and i think it is just paranoia at this point i want it to stop but i dont know how to and i think them talking about me before just gave me trust issues in a way
my story was from long ago so i dont remember many things for which i am sorry

it was my first or second grade at school i was the sort of quiet kid after lessons i usually sat alone or walked across corridors not talking to anybody

one day my classmate  lets call him nick  brought a bionicle toy for context it must have been  i saw him playing with it surrounded by a goup of other kids while we were at the beginning of a break between classes a couple of minutes passed and nick decided to eat some food in our school canteen others followed him our teacher also left for a break so in the class there was only me and some other kid daniel

before leaving nick put his bionicle toy on a table and didnt take it with himself as soon as they went out of the room i walked to nicks desk grabbed his bionicle toy threw it on a floor and started jumping on it breaking it into halves after that i stood up stooped grabbed its remains and put them back on the table stonefaced and completely silent

now daniel who sat at the other corner of the room and whom i hadnt noticed or taken into consideration before breaking the toy saw me doing this as i remember it he said that he was going to tell nick about this and ran to the corridor both furious and afraid i pursued him when i managed to get to daniel he was already standing near nick and pointing his finger at me even before either of them said anything to me i started accusing daniel of breaking a toy when nick who was not convinced asked me why i did it i said it was an accident and i stepped on it because it had already been on the floor and i didnt notice it

eventually nick saw his toy broken and my mom had to pay their family to buy a new one

it breaks my heart sometimes to this day that nick was not at all angry at me he was just very sad about his toy also he didnt bear a grudge on me i didnt deserve this

in addition i am sorry to say it but i think that when i chased daniel who wanted to report my action to nick i was intending to either beat him or threaten him

naturally i would not allow myself to do any of these things today i am frankly scared of myself as a child like i said i was quiet very obedient to teachers and extremely introverted to this day i have absolutely no clue of what my motivation was me and nick never had any coflicts at all or what i felt when i did my wrongdoing

as an adult  am genuinely spooked by it it seems so out of blue and at the same time so psychopathic i clearly remember the sequence of my actions and that i did it in a very clear state of mind i  wanted to do this and expressed no visible emotions while in action as if it was normal or planned

all in all i am sorry and i am glad grew up into an empathetic and friendly person
this was some years ago but i havent really told anyone about it 

it was late at night during a blizzard and as usual my two buddies and i would bust out the atvs there was this large water retention basin behind a residential development it was huge and very deep wed ride full throttle up the walls like it was a race track with banked corners i had my friend on the back of the atv i was driving and the other guy was on his own atv 

we would play games like tag without actual contact but just getting close enough to each other counted as a tag he was chasing me so in an attempt to get away i drove full throttle up the side and never let off the gas i forgot which direction i was facing two of the sides of the basin had flat ground at the top the other two sides immediately dropped back down behind the berm i had driven up the side where the ground dropped back down we were going so fast that the entire atv left the ground for what felt like an eternity and we landed feet from a fence

the ground was so slippery that i couldnt stop in time and we blew thru this residential fence sliding almost all the way onto their back porch the fence was in  pieces and the entire plastic front end of the atv was crack the scattered fence debris looked like a stampede had just come thru their back yard i threw the atv into reverse and got out of there as fast as possible and drove home 

the fence wasnt fixed for months but it did eventually get repaired
when i was younger some age before  i was assaulted 

my family minus my dad were visiting a family friend and because we lived so far away we were staying with her and her husband in their house it was summer and we hadnt seen them in a long time so my mom planned to stay for about  weeks

we werent technically related but i called the family friend aunt and her husband by his name i dont actually remember much about the husband just that he was super nice me to and gave me a lot of attention i had middle kid syndrome so it was nice that an adult actually wanted to talk to me whenever i could id spend time with him and be practically glued to his side and he always said how much he loved having me around and how much he missed me when i wasnt there i was so stupid

i dont remember when it started but at some point during the visit he began assaulting me at first i was just confused and didnt understand what he was doing he was acting so normal about it and i trusted him so i didnt say anything eventually i got really uncomfortable and asked to do something else but he just kept telling me id like it and id make him sad if i didnt then it just got worse 

it happened almost everyday weather he was assaulting me or forcing me to perform acts for him ive mostly blocked out the memory but some are just too vivid to forget i have no idea where my family was during all these times because it was often in the middle of the day i guess no one was paying attention to my change in behavior 

before we went back home he made me promise not to tell anyone or else i would be in trouble which i remember confused me because he had told me we werent doing anything wrong

once back home several states away i would have night terrors and wet myself for months i hated being touched and id make my sister sit in the bathroom with me while i showered because i was scared still no one payed attention to the signs

a few years ago my mother tearfully told me the husband had been convicted of assault and possession of cp and was facing up to  years apparently i hadnt been the first kid and i wasnt the last 

she asked me if he had ever touched me inappropriately and all i could think was that would be an understatement 
i looked my mom in the eyes and told her he hadnt and left it at that we havent talked about it since then but i think about it even more than i did before she told me i cant help but feel that maybe if i had told her in the very beginning when it first happened maybe he wouldnt have hurt anyone else
i had older friends who had cars we decided one night while hanging out we would drive almost two hours away for a festival there was music drugs and people were trading different things i traded my shoes for a drop from a vile i was told it was peyote i got this as the night was winding down i took it and waited an hour before deciding it was bunk my friends all agreed i should drive since everyone was intoxicated and i didnt drink and supposedly had bunk drugs i started driving and about an hour in i got crazy high hallucinating the road moving around and just completely not okay to drive i didnt think i could stop so i went all the way to my friends house to ride out the rest of my trip looking back at people i could have hurt or felonies i could have gotten makes me feel sick the invincibility fable is very true drugs are bad mmkay

edit this was not in the s im  so this was in 
when i f was younger maybe around f i would used to do what every child would when they grew up and ride bikes around the neighborhood 
i dont know what possessed my mind to do this but there was a point in time where i would ride around stop in front of peoples mailboxes open them rip their mail in half close the box and speed off 
i would do it to multiple boxes in different parts of the neighborhood 
i never got caught and its not that i did it much maybe about  days back to back 
eventually i got the sense that it was wrong and completely stopped but i really dont know what would have possessed me to do that in the first place
i just hope that i didnt rip up anything too important like bills or a special letter 
i definitely know better now since years have passed but seeing this page made me randomly think of this so i decided to leave it here
ill break this down into chapters for clarity

introi grew up in the most affluent sect of city tx with loving parents and a large family attended the best private schools for middle school and high school and had an abundance of friends there are  major private high schools in city where pretty much everyone knows everyone or is connected to some degree by family and friends as ive grown up and shared stories of my high school experience with others ive felt more and more like it was totally messed up and not the typical teenage antics i thought it to beill start with th grade

th grade alcohol  weedthe first time i drank was the summer going into th grade i cant put my finger on the reason or motivation but i vividly remember having a sleepover and just deciding we were going to try to drink it was portsherry from my parents pantry thought it was whiskey or rum at the time from that point for the rest of th grade we occasionally raided our parents liquor supply at sleepovers usually just acting like idiots or getting sickas th grade comes to an end about  of my group of friends was set to attend the same high school around this time again with no specific infighting event that i can remember we decided we wanted to try smoking weed so we did i found it and bought the classic overpriced  eighth and we smoked it out of a bong made of a gatorade bottle a pen tube and tinfoilfreshman yr psychedelic mushrooms  alcohol weedfirst semester of freshman year i and two friends of mine took shrooms for the first time again sought them out ourselves and took them at one of our houses at a sleepover this experience was very jarring as we were  years old and took about  grams each if youve never done psychedelics there is no possible way you can imagine how significantly your perception of reality can be warped and transcended by a natural substance so yeah that was intense great experience there thoughthrough freshman year we stuck with weed and alcohol but definitely started expressing curiosity about other things

sophomore yr rx painkillers and xanax mdmamolly mushrooms weed alcoholsummer going into sophomore year was the first time i took what i consider hard drugs i got a bottle of hydrocodone syrup after having my tonsils removed so being from city the first thing we thought to do was try sipping lean and draping a blunt lean is codeine mixed with spite and jolly rancher but hydrocodone is much stronger draping means coating a blunt in the same opioid syrup and smoking itin this same month we got ahold of some xanax which we were eager to try the first time i did it was during summer school class i crushed  of a xanax bar into power rolled it into a thin piece of toilet paper and swallowed it this is called parachuting which causes the drug to take effect exponentially faster since it is already powdered and does not need to dissolve made a fool of myself at lunch after class and got dropped off at home without issue but dont remember the rest of that daywe continued with these two substances  the routine weed and alcoholall of this stayed seemingly consistent through sophomore and junior year with some increase in frequency and perceived normalcy as more of us got drivers licenses and cars and parties became more common for us

summer before junior year  id become so comfortable with this lifestyle that i became super careless at any given time there was a  chance i had weed alcohol pills or evidence thereof in my car i smoked weed every day before and after school and if i didnt have weed at the end of the day for bed it was a crisisthen i got arrested and put on probation w drug testing heres the messed up thing about drug testing it only stops you from using weed everything else gets out of your system after  days and i always knew when my probation checkins were so everything else stayed fair game this was bad

senior year cocaine xanax hydrocodone codeine adderall mdma lsd weed alcohol

i would say that my senior year in high school was perhaps the most unhinged as far as substance abuse although much of it continued through college we had a better grasp on what we were dealing with and what we didnt care for

here are the frequencies of use for each vice during senior year as an yo

weed and adderal  before school a lot after school and before bed

alcohol cocaine or adderal  every weekend frisun about  daysweek during grad party season

xanax and painkillers  almost every weekendlsd  tried st time loved it great drug

mdma  every concert some grad parties

by this point we knew where to get anything and were as comfortable as anyone could ever be with doing it the only things we hadnt touched and never had a desire to were heroin meth and pcpa lot of us continued through college together

in college weed remained a daily staple alcohol was definitely every weekend and a lot of week days cocaine was a given for every function and even just sunday night football on the couch lsd mushrooms and mdma were for concerts bro trips and major parties xanax and painkillers became less common because taking them guarantees at best youre sleeping alone that night or worse youre waking up in jail or with a phone full of burned bridges and missed callsive never met someone outside of the group i grew up with who had a similar experience for the most part people either havent experimented with anything until college or somehow avoided everything or have only ever engaged in socially acceptable drinking and some pot

i often wonder what my life would be like if i had taken the clean riskaverse route
i made a shit ton of money thousands the  to  used to be about 

i started off buying directly from livestrong about  worth for  bands after carriage it cost me between 

i then sold them for  a pop in school
i then found on ebay someone selling thousands of livestrong bands for even less i did the same with these lot

then the blue beat bullying bands came out which were given away for free all i had to do was one name written into a radio station
i sent various bob smith bobby smith etc and within a few days i had close to a hundred arrive all for free i sold these for 

the pinnacle of my selling was when i got collared by a teacher and taken to the staff room youre selling those live strong bands arent you
ye how much  
ill have onethe other teacher get me one too

ill do you a deal  for 
i often lie about and deny whether i am sexually interested in someone elses wife girlfriend my friends whatsoever or whether i already got over a failed date or relationship in reality i search for prostitutes who kinda look like them who i am supposed to not be be interested in
i went to a bar for the first time finally conquering the anxiety but i smoked a joint before and pre gamed a tall boy  and had a lot of drinks maybe like  or  i drove myself there and back and i feel guilty because on the way back i was ridiculously fucked up as id smoked a joint on the way home too just felt like sharing feeling slightly guilty i was not okay to drive but im a good driver sober so i was perfectly fine but still not okay 
this happened a few weeks ago i was pulling into a parking spot and misjudged the angle of going in and scrapped another car i sat around and waited for like ten minutes but nobody came out waited like ten minutes and then bounced there was probably only a few hundred dollars of damage because the paneling had come off a bit
so basically when i was  i was a bit of a shthead i somehow managed to keep majority of my wrong doings away from my parents

xb

well one night i decided it would be a good idea to take my fathers truck out for a test drive granted i didnt make it very far i tried to back out of the drive way hit the corner of my neighbors garage then got scared and pulled it back in no damage to the neighbors garage but the bumper to the truck pretty much had to be repaired

my dad has always thought that someone else had hit the truck granted he wasnt that upset i dont think considering he thought it would be a good time to teach me how to repair it so we did and i never told him and for some reason after  years guilt is setting in im not in my bad place anymore only lasted till i was  but needed to get it off my chest
this happened a few years back but i still feel really guilty about it 

my dad is an alcoholic hes been sober just over a year now but before then it was very hard to live with him he wasnt physically abusive by any means but he would always mumble under his breath calling us slobs or just expressing his irritation with how we exist around him 

he always kept his mini bottles and vodka his preferred drink in the kitchen cabinet one day i woke up around am and he was wasted already i was genuinely worried about him and checked the cabinet where i found a half empty bottle of vodka ive watched my step mom replace some alcohol with water and decided to take matters into my own hands this time i didnt want him going back to the hospital for what felt like the th time from alcohol poisoning

i wasnt sure how much to replace and this is where i definitely messed up i figured alcohol is strong enough to flavor a good amount of water ive drank a few times but not enough to get drunk as im terrified of the addiction i replaced half of whats in the bottle with water after pouring some alcohol out and put it back in the cabinet

i watched him not even  minutes later come into the kitchen and take a sip of his vodka he was fuming his went into his and my step moms room and yelled at her for a solid  minutes 

i felt terrible but didnt say anything as i already have low self esteem due to my drunk father and didnt want to feel lower than low again 

disclaimer i am now  but  or  during this time my dad is sober as of  year and a few months i attend allanon meetings and therapy for the mental distress from his period of drinking my dad is an amazing man just not so great when he was drunk
okay so my classroom in elementary always had a jar full of candies that my teacher would keep on her desk to give out to kids who behaved well did good work or maybe scored higher than usual on the weekly spelling test 

during lunchtimes i would ask to go to the toilet while everyone was outside i never did they never kept classrooms locked in my school so when i was going to the toilet i really just used to go to my teachers desk and take a handful of candy 

my teacher obviously noticed that candy was disappearing quicker than she was giving it out and she asked whoever it was to confess i never came forward and as a result she stopped having the candy jar i felt bad for a couple years afterwards but dont really anymore because it was  years ago
in my school at the start of the year the school would lend you the textbooks that you may need the textbooks had barcodes assigned by the school and the school kept track of which book was owned by which student 

i had a textbook for a fairly popular class i ended up losing it and i panicked i didnt want to tell my parents they were shelling out money for a replacement textbook i ended up finding someone elses book and hatched a plan i took out the barcode put in by the school it was just a sticker so it was easy to remove i was going to turn that book in at the end of the year and say i bought a replacement because i lost mine 

it never ended up coming to that a little while later i ended up finding my book i just turned my book in at the end of the year i threw the book that i stole in the trash and never looked back 

i still feel guilty some poor kid probably got yelled at by his parents when they had to pay for the book 

tldr lost textbook stole one
everytime we had a project or activity my first grade teacher would let us sit on random desks our desks were open front so everytime i saw one of my classmates get a new toy sticker or eraser and put it inside their desks i would discretely approach their desk and take the toy or whatever item i found was interesting or cool looking for some reason nobody complained that stuff went missing from their desks i remember a kid got the lego star wars character encyclopedia that had a han solo minifigure packaged inside when i sat on his desk for an activity i removed the minifigure from the package later i saw him check out his book and he noticed someone ripped the minifigure off he didnt even tell the teacher he just looked a little sad but i guess he moved on from it after that i stopped doing it because i felt guilty and because i just simply didnt want to steal anymore i find this a little bit funny now that im  but i kind of do feel a little bad sometimes lol
so one time i wanted an scp foundation class five programmable keycard off amazon and so i went upstairs to my older sisters room and took her  amazon gift card and went in my room and spent  from the gift card
when i was about  i was moving to a new house with my family i tripped and rolled my ankle in the bathroom and it kind of hurt but the pain went away after a few hours but as a dumb and lazy kid i decided to lie and say it still hurt really bad to get out of packing to move out kept this act on for about a week and my mom decided i needed to go to the doctor to make sure i didnt sprain my ankle or anything my little  year old self started to panic a bit because i really felt no pain at all but i thought i was to deep into the lie to back out by then we went to the doctor and did an xray and i was thinking im screwed im perfectly fine and this xray will just prove im lying results came back and i was thinking i was about to get in big time trouble for lying about something so serious only for the doctor to say i fractured my ankle apparently i was going on for days with a fractured ankle that didnt hurt whatsoever and didnt realize i had to wear a boot for the entire summer i felt guilty for lying about it for the longest time but if i didnt i could have seriously messed up my ankle now i laugh thinking of it since its such a stupid story no one except for me knows that i lied about this and i dont know if i ever will tell my parents probably one of the more tame confessions here but definitely a strange one i thought i should share i really dont know why my ankle didnt hurt
so when i was around  me and my mom went to see my little brother play hockey at the arena we could register to win  by bying a small ticket with a number on it and they would do a draw then give the  to the person with the matching ticket numbers

the thing is my mom asked me to hold her ticket while she was searching her purse but i gave her my initial ticket back guess what number came up in the draw mine my mothers initially so i claimed the prize and never told her that it was her ticket in the first place

mind you my mom was a bit struggling financially during this time and she even told me that a  would be great for her she told me this after i won the money anyway i still feel bad even after  years i shouldve give it to her i dont even remember what i did with the money stupid kid
i am currently doing a second degree which is going much better my parents are also paying for that so blessed im actually getting interviews for jobs and internships this time 

ok so first time i went to college i went straight to university and did poorly as im barely above a  i would tell my parents that i was getting as and bs when i was actually on academic probation i kept lying to them about it only this time i managed to pull it up to something okayish  after year  i stopped going to class and my gpa plummeted all the way down to  keep in mind that it took me  years to get my degree when i graduated i didnt bother to use my degree
this one kid in my class always brought like two to three maybe even four dollars in quarters every day i think it was to pay off his lunch debt or buy lunch which was strange because he always brought packed lunch 

he always kept the quarters in one of the side pockets of his lunchbox and he always kept the lunchbox in his locker i asked to go to the bathroom went to his locker and stole like two dollars in quarters then at lunch i bought myself some brownies
i f lied about getting accepted into college now im in a big city living alone 

i need somewhere to let this out i have been waking up with a constant worry or unsureness heavy feeling upset stomach i dont know how to put my finger on it nor describe it i did everything i could to move out and start a new life i guess its just not going my way right now i dreamt of going to this college since th grade but i didnt think i was gonna get accepted so i went to another college i had a very sheltered life so i ended up back at home but it was a very toxic environment and my mothers and i relationship suffered for the last two years

so i saved up and applied to start college for spring semester everything was cut so short because of my abrupt leave at my previous university i found an apartment and got a job and waited prayed for an acceptance letter i knew i wouldve been moved in before i could register for classes but as classes started i got my answer back denied 

yep now im in a new city next to a college campus with no friends im so grateful that i have a way to stay afloat im so grateful that i have new opportunities to experience but is this the way it supposed to go should i have stayed home worked out some thing else and then moved out i just wasnt happy there i thought i could be happy here because this is a city that ive always wanted to be or that id be in classes and i can meet people on campusclubsdining hall but how do i start a life now
im just a  year old teenage girl in a big city with no plans now and i did that to myself so where the hell do i go now and this has been haunting me for the past week 

ive been waking up and working out about to start my new day at my job i also have a remote job so ive been inside a lot  i have roommates but they all think im in college i just feel stuck

editupdated first of all i wanna appreciate everybody that commented and left advice i really appreciate it i read every comment and it really gave me more drive to figure out myself in this new city i wanted to answer your questionsassumptions 

first i come from a single parent household my mom has done so much for me but as i got older i realized i did a lot for her i am the oldest daughter out of six kids i didnt really have a life outside of home it was my mothers way or the highway i appreciate my mom but i cant live for her anymore or watch my siblings  cant hang out with friends cause she would be calling me telling me to come home when i went to university my freshman year i was so shelteredsocially anxious that i made so many stupid decisions for my safety for myself i just went home for the last two years  to  i realize if i have to live life for myself or ill forever be living for my mother my mother and i relationship is already benefiting from the distance that we have from each other i will be looking into community college out here since i am right next to campus i thought about going to advisor and talking about steps for an appeal 

as for staying afloat i pay all my bills myself my car rent utilities etc except for my phone bill now that i think about it lol i appreciate my mom for teaching me my work ethic i also wouldnt have the remote job that pays me really good if it wasnt for my mom because my boss is her friend lol then i also have a serving job that i start tomorrow 

i appreciate the advice on going on a self discovery journey i think that opened up my mind to more of just making friends and experiencing the city with others cheers to starting my adult life 
i used to work a job asshole boss whatever an old keyboard caught my eye and i ended up taking it home to clean up i ended up keeping it because i liked it but i no longer use it i think values of them are around 

looking back i wish i asked if i could have taken it and i think about it somewhat often i also worry that they know and that it could resurface someday in the moment i justified this by my hatred for the situation but i wish i hadnt done it
so when i was around  years old i moved to another country to pursue college education since in my country is way more expensive to be able to get a degree from a good university when i arrived to the country i moved to i had pretty much no money i was working at a job that paid a really horrible salary barely enough to pay my rent and my mental health was going to shit one day i watched the joker movie and most of the movie really spoke to me it fed into that im tired of everything mentality that i was having at the time so that same day at night i got absolutely blasted and went inside of a bar i stayed inside the place debating to steal a laptop that they were using to play music at first i was kind of scared but the alcohol helped me calm my nerves eventually the owner started closing the place down and asking people to leave at that moment i quickly grabbed the laptop put it inside my jacket and left the place running i lived nearby so i just got to my house turned off the computer and tried to go to sleep despite feeling adrenaline all over my body the next day i woke up and felt really shitty i regretted so much stealing the computer that a couple of weeks from that day i went to the same place hoping that they wouldnt recognise me and left the laptop inside one of the bathrooms for a while i was very paranoid walking around my neighborhood because i believed everyone was warching me but after returning the computer i started to feel a little bit less guilty and i promised myself to never do such a thing again
i recently turned  and i just fucked up real bad im not a man im fucking ashamed and i want to commit after this shit my childhood friends were over a few nights ago but i was upset with them because of the way they were treating my dog and my home i didnt want to hangout with them as i told them to leave but my sister insisted on them staying i continued to feed my computer addiction by sitting alone in my office grinding video games my mom then came in and told me to goto applebees with them i told her no and she kept bugging me as a good mother should

this is where shit really happens

she unplugs my computer and in a quick flash i grabbed her arm and threw her into the wall i didnt believe i did it hard but i did it

my mom is the most loving mother in the world shes a single mom who works her fucking ass off every damn day for my sister and i and i just threw dirt and did the most disgusting act i couldve done to her she never deserved this im here to protect her im the only man in my house and this is what i do im so fucking confused on how i could ever rationally put my hands on a woman let alone my own mother 

 i felt nothing i wasnt angry upset or annoyed it was a quick action

why did i do it

im addicted to my games i feel like an ipad kid im a fucking loser who hits his mom because she wanted him off the electronics to goto dinner with his friends 

i just fucked my whole life up

i cant believe id ever do such a thing

edit i apologized to my mother with my full heart i will never commit as i was reminded that will only hurt my mother even more what she needs to see is me grow and learn from this rock bottom this is my catalyst to my next journey i wont let this event define me for who i am for im lucky enough to not goto prison for it i will show my mother what she deserves for working so hard for me to live a better life than she did thank you all for your comments not a single one that i disagreed with 

edit  for more background info i do have a father i just dont live with him he called me yesterday since my sister told him dishes crashed and my ears became deaf through the phone screaming and yelling is all i remember but from all of this i realized that i dont have to weep and sorrow there are people who love me and believe in me that i could change i believe in myself not all of that but thanks to all of you and every single comment whether harsh or too kind theyve pushed me to go farther ill be using this momentum again thank you all for your guidance thoughts and opinions 

moonsters out
i grew up with some intrinsic urge to steal started young taking change off the counter a couple dollars from my moms wallet then shoplifting candy bars and cds from a local record shop when cds were popular they would package them in these tall thin plastic packaging antitheft no doubt id slip the whole thing down my pants i also stole some cds from people i knew

in high school i got kicked out after my first year at a new school because i stole from my roommate they roomed me with this rich japanese kid who never went to class and flaunted his wealth i felt like why did he get to enjoy everything and not even have to go to class but i do i would steal japanese yen from him then go to the local bank and exchange for dollars kind of ambitious and a little fucked up i got busted somehow dad wanted to kill me by an act of god they let me back in the next year i was known as that kid who stole people talked about me behind my back and some teachers really didnt like me they thought i should not have been allowed back in to the school a fair point but in the end i needed tobe in that school and i ended up graduating in the end it was fine never saw that japanese kid again

in college i snuck into someones room and stole some sunglasses and various other small items i think they found it but it was like the last day of school before everyone left

i dont know why honestly i think i always felt like i was lacking saw things i wanted but didnt have although i came from a middle class background and never really lacked anything essential my parents never gave me any pocket money so as a kid what do you do my friends all had money so from  on i had part time jobs i worked at a seafood market i worked at a mafia owned italian restaurant i delivered medicine to elderly homes i worked at baskin  robbins and numerous other restaurant jobs in my teens

when i got to college on the very first day i went to the job fair to get a job because my parents gave me no cash for anything i dont know what they thought i was supposed to do they thought since the cafeteria was included i had food and shelter why would i need money who knows my first job at college was at the library for  an hour worked all through college

after college i tried to steal from batteries from cvs and got totally busted by security they made me pay a  fine on the spot or risk arrest so i said im sorry paid and that was that but i knew i never wanted to get in any real trouble with the law essentially i am not a criminal or a bad person i just had this problem

then i changed in my early s

i did a year abroad in france in college saw the world in a different way had new experiences i was humbled and intrigued by a big new world not sure exactly why but i went through a transformation and i never stole again i grew out of it it just becamewrong

one of my best friends from high school we reconnected and lived near each other a few years later in boston this is mid s now it was good times there for a bit but then an incident occurred someone stole some music equipment from his housemate i knew who did it it was my other best friend we were all a group this guy was starting to have mental health issues and ended up schizophrenic but thats another story however my friend thought i stole the equipment it was an obvious conclusion because of what happened in high school but i didnt do it actually i would never have stolen hundreds of dollars of hardware from anyone that was beyond my ambitions and very risky although he never confronted me that ended our friendship at that point i had ended my petty thievery but the stigma was on me

im lucky i never got in more trouble than i did since that time i have never stolen anything again it just didnt interest me anymore it was wrong i wouldnt have wanted things stolen from me so i had more perspective and compassion as i matured

i just grew out of it i never wanted to hurt anyone at this point im the most honest person you will ever meet 

anyway this is something i have never spoken about with anyone really people think if you were a thief then you are always a thief so if it ever came up for whatever reason its like a stigma over your head

anyway thats my confession
hey im sam around three years ago i met someone through the internet after a while i completely fell in love with him we even ended up dating but theres something ive been doing from the start ive been lying about who i am i sent fake pictures even fake voice messages for years to him and my friends i dont know how i was capable of doing it for so long mainly because of how close we all were it started to get to me eat me from the inside so i decided it would be great to tell them about who i really am and finally be honest there was a lot of tears from both sides but i did it i finally told them the truth and it felt really good my friend took it okay which im to this day surprised of and even my partner did which i was extremely happy for but was he really okay

it turns out he wasnt not at all it hurt him a lot and i hate the fact that i hurt him after all i made him fall in love with someone else he lost a huge amount of trust for me which i admit is valid i tried to make it better somehow but i knew the mental scar will always be there for both of us after a while it even started to look okay i was being all honest and no more lies but it was still bothering him a lot he ended up losing his feelings for me partially and breaking up with me but said itd be cool to still stay friends

my now ex partner was still someone i loved though i could not move on so quickly and i still didnt his trust for me began to disappear as well to the point he thought i was cheating on him with my friend i think its fair to state i used to be in a romantic relationship with that friend but it barely lasted a year i do not feel any romantic attraction to him right now i consider him as my family and he has a girlfriend and my partner knew him well and knew we used to date thats why i thought itd be okay my partner was worried about me cheating on him many times i always reassured him i never cheated on him and never had anyone in my mind other than him 

another thing me and my now ex used to match profile pictures on basically every platform we used which of course had to go after we broke up like a month after the break up my friend he was worried about asked me if id like to match just a picture of our favorite sibling characters platonic i agreed i dont know what i was thinking i shouldve known itd upset my now ex when he told me about it i thought of it and decided to change it not to match anymore my friend changed it to one picture i drew of him once which upset my ex a lot they ended up not talking anymore

which i think was one of the things that got him mad he got really mad at me and ended up saying everything he really thought about my lies and about the things i did i did not know what to say and anytime  did i felt like i made everything worse hes considering leaving i dont wanna let him go hes still such huge part of my life and i still love him but if hell wanna leave its completely fair 

there are some things i did not like that he did and also hurt me in a fucked up way but i dont feel like its very valid for me to mention it since what i did is such shit thing to do in fact i cried many nights and i was so embarrassed of myself so ashamed i feel like its not valid for me to be the one hurt i hurt everyone around me with such horrible lie

i still love him so much and i do gotta admit our relationship wasnt very healthy but it hurts to see him actually consider leave i would work on it for years to make it healthy or to make him feel better but it was visibly making him feel even worse it was like a reality check when he said all the things he said they hurt me a lot but i think it was necessary for them to hurt so i would finally understand i cannot stop drowning in quilt for like  months now and its horrible whats even worse is i cannot take anything i did back even though i wish i did i wish i never hurt him i wish i never lied about who i am and i wish i was at least a bit better i feel like the worst partner ever

thanks to anyone who read it i apologize if it seems like a shit confession but i had to get it off my chest

edit  hey though of it again and i realized i left out some detail so ill say them now i lied to the point when i photoshopped images to prove i am actually that person and made stupid excused why i cant callfor example that my voice is weak yes this probably makes it even shittier but i just had ro say it
my partner already had severe trust issues so this made everything ofc worse again i feel really shitty about it but i had to mention this as well thank you
lost my relationship last september  was nd relationship of my  years of life 
after breakup i realized i might have been manipulating my ex
i used to tell her that im very lucky to have her  i really meant it  she can get anyone in her life am i really capable of making you happy  deep down in my heart i knew yes i can make her happy  but why did i still say that thing dont cheat on me please you will never leave me right  i knew she will never do such thing  i lied to her for the first time  i used to say i hate liars which i really do  and i got caught  im dumb i cant lie  and then i thought again why did i say all those things why did lie and then atlast i was just blaming my previous relationship for my insecurities and manipulative behaviour 

i never got a chance to apologize and now im disgusted of myself i ruined her first time being in a relationship i became exactly what she hated the most i will never forgive myself for what i did
im  european mostly northwestern so basically a common white american but my moms side of the family happens to be olive skinned with dark hair we all tan real easy and my mom would regularly get mistaken for a hispanic woman not sure what happened there but because of this i would sometimes get asked what my background or ethnicity was and i got tired of just saying white so i would lie and make up something like egyptian or brazilian or something that would make me seem exotic after years of doing that i found out that i had to stop because those people i would meet would become friends who wanted to come over and meet my parents and wouldnt they be shocked to find out both of my parents are english speaking americans after i told them a whole different story it never came back to bite me but i still cringe when i think of it wat a weird thing to lie about right lol
hi i am sorry i just turned  
my dad cheated on my mom and married this lady named stella this all happened in such a short amount of time i am overwhelmed 
stella is awful im sorry 
shes niceish but i hate having to live with her i also have to help take care of her she has diabetes and other health issues and i feel like these expectations are demanded of me so quickly 

i am so overwhelmed all the time because she is overwhelmingly loud she slams cabinet doors and drawers and doors she talks loudly she blasts music loudly she does everything loudly it makes me cry sometimes i just want to come home from school and enjoy the quiet to relax and i cant my dad doesnt give a fuck he just lets her i feel like how i live my life has changed so much in such a short amount of time 

to combat this when they arent looking i lower the tv 
they get upset and get into arguments and accuse each other of changing the volume or argue about whether they should get a new tv 

i just want my mom to be honest 
i hate all of this
this is an throwaway account probably wont be responding

about  years ago i wanted to invest my money so i did the only thing reasonable and learned anything i could about investing i even made a demo account with fake money to see if i was right in my predictions but more on that later at the time i actually was really interested in investing and i i had fun researching ways on how i could make my money grow fast forward  a year and investing was the only thing i talked about i now understand why my friends got annoyed with it and started to ask how much i actually made investing i told them i didnt make anything right now and i was planning to open a real portfolio with my savings in it soon

now i am genuinely a calm guy who doesnt get pissed off easily but when i hear the same question every  hour for  hours straight for two weeks i will loose it i also noticed it became kind of a joke and people would ask me how much i made from investing just to drive me insane at least thats how it felt one day i decided to buy an option on the demo account and just to keep it  really short options are high risk high return bets on a stocks price on a certain point in time since it was a demo account i said fuck it and bought k of my k portfolio on an amazon call exp in  week something i would never do with real life money i cant stress enough how much of a gamble this was somehow this gamble payed out and my entire portfolio was now worth k in fake money
honestly i felt really good although i knew it was all sheer luck and it didnt affect me really

the next day after i closed my position one of my close friends comes up to me and asks if i would ever invest any money i still felt really entitled from yesterday and thought what would happen if i lied and said this fake demo account was real and i made k overnight i guess i let myself go told him exactly that he then asked me to show him and i opened my account and his jaw dropped seeing my return he congratulated me and showed a lot of other friends who were close by when asked what i would do with all that money i said i would reinvest into something safer and not spend it just so no one would get ideas and ask me for money 

at the time it felt good really good a lot of people started talking to me and everybody seemed really nice looking back now i feel terrible this lie has been on me the day i told it and it has been going on for a year now without anyone noticing yes there were some close calls however nothing big to raise suspicion

i feel bad and i lost the joy of learning ever since everything became boring i feel like i cheated on everybody this was the first and hopefully the only time i will ever have to say i am richer that i am i am a fraud and cant trust myself anymore but with what i barely do anything these days i lay most of my free time in bed watching nonsense i never even invested a single penny

if you got this far thank you i just felt like i had to get this out maybe i can finally change now
statute of limitations on this one is up so i feel safe confessing it still going to be vague enough that it could be anyone and anywhere though 

at the time i was living with an emotionally abusive ex who often refused to work we had rent of  a month was supposed to be  but they hit us with a lot of fees we werent told about before signing the lease too ignorant at the time to know what to do so we suffered for a year we were constantly just barely paying rent on time constantly having to borrow and payback family i had to ask people to pay me back money i had forgotten about for over a year because i was desperate
we were barely able to eat which was compounded by my ex randomly deciding he didnt deserve to eat and refusing to eat the food i bought for him until it went bad he would only eat if i cooked is the real reason and if i cooked and saved leftovers for myself he would eat those because i wasnt so i also had to budget one fast food meal in for me when at work because sometimes i wasnt able to eat at home due to this 
i was already stealing food at walmart the dollar store and the grocery store sometimes being as bold as to put it in my purse when i knew there were no cameras and other times just using mt purse to hide it and giving plausible deniabiliry i forgot about it if its pointed out which meant buying it to avoid suspicion and cutting further into the budget

it was at such a dire state i usually withdrew my paychecks in cash and set aside the rent money and would obsessively count and recount it daily to see how much more we needed on my next check and doing what i could to try to take overtime and make more than that so we could eat too

so one month we were desperate our rental company wouldnt accept anything less than the  full payment or theyd reject your money order 
we were  short no one could lend us we wouldnt get paid again for two weeks which is too late every day we were late would also be  fine on top of the rent so if we would be able to get money friday we would need like xhow many days until then  the 
so
one day in an absolute panick i stole  from our tip jar at work i have no idea how i wasnt caught as i did it in front of the camera it was near the holidays and people were tipping us well so it just took secretly pocketing two s
but that  wouldve been split for the whole store so it was a greedy if desperate thing to do

but it got us through that month once our lease was up we were able to move somewhere cheaper and i felt brave enough to dump my loser ex 
im in a better situation now and havent stolen anything at all since then 

i only got caught once during this period and they let me go with a warning once i paid for the item 

but i couldve thrown my whole life away for a desperate moment 

fuck landlords tho especially corporate ones
hey folks this is my throwaway account and i want to confess to an incident that happened to me a few days back it was my exam which didnt go well the exam was early around  am in the morning after the exam i came home and slept for almost  hours when i woke up one of my friends told me that he had some w and i went to his place we smoked some w and on my way for a second i lost my sight and crashed into a car the speed wasnt that high but it affected the other car badly the boot lid collapsed and the lights and glass shattered everyone was in shock one guy came over to my car and i just accelerated and ran over him he might got hurt but i still ran away the time was almost  pm so no one could read the number plate the next day before any of my family members woke up i got my car fixed it wasnt that bad but i really feel sorry for that guy i dont remember the car but it was an expensive one if i hadnt had any w i could have stopped myself but the laws in my country are very strict and i could have ended up getting jailed for almost  years with that stuff
what do you guys think for the sake of my career and family i did that thing right or wrong coz this incident is coming in my mind again and again and cant get over it 
mind my grammar i am not from an english speaking country
when i was  my sister bought a brand new cc scooter she let me have a go as we live down a country lane i was speeding turned a corner and i saw a man walking his dog and panicked 
the motorbike went on to the grass verge and i crashed it the front wheel was out of alignment which i straightened back and they was mud and grass all over one side 
i managed to clean this off before returning back home with only minor scratches 

she never found out to  this day she doesnt know
a couple years back i was working a night shift job

backstory
wed clean stores typically  or  depending how bad they are sometimes they were in town others close to two hours away  i typically liked waking up early for school  started at  but would be awake around   anyways not important  id get home around ish and that night we had a job that was two hours away  go to work we do everything and now its time to head back  wed all carpool and go from there  we get back to my friends house and im literally exhausted and drained have been awake since am went to school then worked and its now around or am next day we arrive and now its only a matter of me heading home which is about  minutes away  

omw home im literally dazing off  nothing is keeping me awake i even have vague memories of passing  or  stop signs and red lights  im less than  minutes from my house i doze off so bad i lose control of the car which made me run over a stop sign which woke the hell out of me  and then run into a mailbox and later into a street light  the entire front car was damaged i park the car and get out and panicking not knowing what to do  the mailbox stand is all bend and the physical mailbox is halfway across the street  absolutely no one was around or came out and this happen on a kinda busy road  i go pick it up and just leave at there door step  i never called the cops or filed insurance  i fixed the car out of pocket sadly  that day lives with me forever because i pass by that road every single day  
everything eventually got fixed i guess the city fixed it or something  idk how i didnt get caught  when i parked i parked at a gas station so the cameras had to have gotten my plates im guessing  i remember it even came out on the local news and newspaper what happened asking people in our town  that if they knew anything to call the city  i was scared for weeks  i never got caught with anything just continued living my ordinary life  

to anyone who works night shift  always be super careful heading home  if you literally cant stay awake just call someone or park somewhere safe and take a nap  dont be dumb like me
my mom died a year ago from breast cancer and my dad basically left me to care for my younger siblings i live paycheck to paycheck and my credit card bank already hired a collections agency to call me everyday im still in a huge debt due to my moms cancer treatments for two years im a few hundred dollars lacking for our rent but i seriously only have around  dollars in my name im desperate and dont know what to do we dont have any relatives or friends that could help us

recently our company hosted a donation drive for christmas and i received around  dollars enough to get me and my siblings through i have it with me right now but im still debating if i should use it or not the company wont be able to track it because these were all given to me anonymously in cash but i still feel bad i know it would help my family so much but i cant stomach thinking that if my mom could see me right now doing what im doing shed be disgusted of me

edit each employee is responsible of collecting the donations and i was able to collect the  dollars the donation drive was not connected to my current living situation but for christmas

xb

update thank you everyone for talking me out of it i havent been myself these past few days but ill do my best  to hang on for my little family ill turn the donations in first thing tomorrow and try to talk to my landlord you were all so kind to a stranger i never knew how much i needed it until now 
i dont know what i was doing i was planning to go home after school in early  on going home i saw my crush i decided to take photos of her behind a sign post and they realised what i was doing i then scrabled home and deleted all the photos i got and i dont know why ive been trying to get this out my head i dont know why ive done that ive been regretting it and i still feel horrible i really feel bad
i fucking love chips cheese and gravy
so i was at the airports duty free and i saw some fragrances i really liked but didnt have the money for it so i stole it

im in my senior year of high school and im supposed to be an early graduate after nearly failing my sophomore year i promised myself that i would make the absolute best effort i could in order to pass i was prone to skipping school days and not doing my work which almost led me to getting held back im my junior year i did well enough to apply for early graduates everyone ive told was so proud of me and all believed i was going to do great 

but 

recently ive fallen back into my old habits for about a month ive been doing terrible in school ive been skipping i havent been doing my work and my grades have tanked massively this semester is the last semester i need to take three of my four classes are the only ones i need left before i can graduate im failing all of them and i have way to many absences 

frankly i have no idea what to do im about a week or two the semester ends thats not nearly enough for me to get back on track i am likely not going to walk at the early graduation and will have to retake the classes the next semester i dont know how people will react

everyone is under the impression that im doing good in school everyone thinks im going to graduate early especially my mom 

when she finds out shes going to be so disappointed in me and i believe everyone else will too people will ridicule me

i dont want to be a failure but i set myself up for that by falling into old habits i wholeheartedly believe that because of this i will make it nowhere in life sure i might get a chance to retake the classes during the second semester or during summer school but what if i dont id have to repeat the whole year and that will not look good on college applications or future resumes

i have literally set myself up for failure when all my family and friends think im destined for greatness

what makes matters worse is that my family is relying on my early graduation everything feels like it rests on my shoulders i was supposed to get a job during the second semester before going to college i was supposed to get a good job after college but it seems my chances of that are practically over 

i have contemplated suicide because of this along with other personal matters but thats not what this post is about if i dont pass school then i will never be anything good in my life

i can think of no solutions for my situation i have heard of people dropping out and getting their ged but i dont know the process of doing that and if it even helps in the long run
i m live in a small southern missourian town an hour south of st louis its a small town where you go to surrounding small towns to run errands me and my girlfriend f were heading home from a grocery store  towns over on the way back i felt the unsettling chirp from the devil himself through my butthole i got off the highway and went to a gas station to get gas and poop we went in paid for gas and i tried to poop but someone was in the bathroom went outside and pumped gas and afterwards i went back inside but the bathroom was still locked at this moment it was do or die it felt like holding it in was an olympic sport there was a kfc right next to this gas station so i go drive my car there and park immediately i run inside leaving the car running with my girlfriend inside i run towards the bathroom and the stall was out of order and in this moment i had to make a decision to a poo my pants or b poop in the broken toilet i went back to my car with clean pants and my girlfriend noticed i looked disgruntled she asked me what was wrong and i said i just pooped in a toilet that was out of order and now some kfc employee is gonna have to clean my poo out of a toilet i almost started crying this was about  months ago and it always lingers in the back of my mind and to the kfc employee that had to clean that  minute long monster turd im sorry
it was little money to steal but i wanted to buy some more pokemon cards my mom didnt noticed that her  dollars were gone but my brother found out that his  dollars were gone he then interrogated me and i said the following words i dont know were your money is at i then got away with because believed me and then my dad gave my big brother his  dollars back should i tell him that i stole the  dollars and my mom that stoled her  dollars
ill keep this short

basically the entirety of neighborhood kids pulled up to my house to play in the garden but we purposefully made sure we didnt invite this one bully who annoyed everybody kid comes to the door with fomo and starts ringing the door bell so much so my mom came outside angry to see who was doing that i explained and told her ill deal with it 
i grabbed a heavy metallic sphere thingy and threw it into the air so it went over the wall surrounding the house 
it lands and the next sound we all heard was a ahhhhhhhh
calm and peace washes over us as the bully isnt bothering us and nothing comes of it 

next day a lady was walking in the neighborhood and she asked me if i knew the kid because his head was broken and she wanted to know what had happened i simply denied knowing anything of it i never told a soul about it 
end of story 
i couldve gone in detail but idk if yalls adhd would follow through with the story

edit
 i did see him some time later and his head was heavily bandaged

back in december i was shopping at my local walmart when i slipped on a card i picked it up and noticed it was a target card i was going to throw it away but decided to check the balance and realized it had  on it i without thinking clicked to add the balance to my target account 

i realized what i did immediately and i honestly didnt feel bad who ever dropped it likely didnt realize it was missing and i could use the money i viewed it as a gift from the other side that was until i noticed a young man and his kid walking around asking people if they had seen a gift card i just said no and continued shopping

i bought some food and laundry soap food that proves to be helpful as i was struggling to afford food and bills without that money i wouldnt have had food i was planning on just not having anything as i was just too broke i needed to make  weeks of food with enough money to buy less than one


edit


because some of the comments ive received i want to clarify that im not justifying what i did im confessing to wrong doing theres no excuse for me to continue to be the way i am thanks to this harsh wake up call i think im going to be talking to my therapist about it i think i have more wrong than i originally thought i legitimately want to be a good person but it seems that if im slightly challenged ill just do anything no matter what to get back ahead ive just started to realize this as im reading the harsh comments i deserve it 
when i was  my dad got me a ps but i had no games to play so i used to spend a lot of my time playing a free beta game online called playstation home its basically kinda like the game sims but online everything is virtual but you pay real money to buy virtual things like clothes special customizations house apartment etc you can also interact with people all over the world in public virtual areas when you type a little bubble appears above your avatars head in which anyone can see nearby 

anyway i was using a girl avatar to troll and i met this arabic man who was in his s who claimed to be rich at first he was teaching me arabic language then it escalated to this weird dom sub kink that he had i had no idea what any of that meant when i was a teen but he wanted me to call him master and make my avatar do certain gestures and in return he would buy me psn cards usually  cards they are like gift cards which you redeem the code and can buy things for playstation so he basically just sent me the code sometimes he would tell me how to spend the psn cards like what outfits to buy for my avatar which were usually skimpy outfits i did everything he asked i was just excited to download digital games from the psn cards that he would give me i did however spent most of his money on playstation home content this went on for a long time eventually i stopped spending so much time in that virtual world as i got older and wanted real life experiences i eventually stopped signing online in playstation but i found out years after that playstation home closed way back in  and its crazy thinking about it because thousands of users were active and spent a lot of time and money on that game which they cant play anymore i regret what i did to get psn cards even though it was all just in that virtual game
im  now

got diagnosed bipolar at  when i was involuntarily committed my first visit with a therapist landed me in a hospital made me refuse to get help for years coped with drugs and was a heroin user for a short period

moved abroad and had my fist episode with psychosis at  i lost a job and had no support or means around me

i found comfort and help in strangers

got into the habit of sleeping with married women older than me sometimes by a decent amount

even allowed myself to be seen after negotiating and agreeing to such things as long as they booked the hotel and paid for everything i could visit 

feel like i objectified myself and had no morals for the respect of what marriage meant

became so routine being called to be seen whenever these people wanted me

so i find it rather hard to live with myself knowing i slept with so many married people and what that says about me

and i dont understand what role i served these women before
at the time i loved lps toys and we went over to some girls house who had them because her older sister gave them to her and one of them was worth over  so i stole it and to this day its in my garage in a box the child was  and i was in th grade so about 
i was pulling out of the garage and once i saw what happened i just drove back in the garage closed the door and pretended it didnt happen i was  maybe and alcohol was involved i wanted to drive around listening to music but failed
i saw spongebob having e head with patrick
i moved to a different town than where i originally lived i moved around march of  so i was  ish when we moved the stealing stopped

back in our old place my siblings and i started taking quarters and minuscule amounts of money from our parents and after a while that evolved into more money like  or  dollars

wanna hear something funny

my brother would blackmail my sister and i to continue to steal threatening to tell our parents if we didnt

it was every few weekends for no more than  years so im sure it never totaled to more than 

i have never told anyone about this i needed to let this go i have promised myself that i will pay my parents for it later in life of course they have no idea what wed done i think my brother never apologized for it he just acts like a dick still i hate him and i hate my sister because even though we both had to go through that she still sided with him and treats me like shit
it was from a shonen jump magazine and he brought it to school just to show it to me cards were banned in school for this exact reason so he showed me it from his locker i knew exactly where it was in his bag and i stole it then i put it back in his locker the next day
i got out and inspected both our cars and they were fine luckily but i am very worried that if someone happened to be watching the security cameras that i could get in big trouble the problem is that theres no damage so theres nothing i could have done to help
no one besides my table buddy knew and it was the funniest things in a classroom ive experienced everyone was laughing all because i mispelt the word loser on a rock

ohhh good times
my rd grade teacher was taking something out of her pocket she was wearing tight jeans so when she took her hand out she unknowingly pulled out a  bill it fell to the ground and she walked away back to her seat i was sitting up front she was beside me when the money fell to the ground i dont remember what went through my head when i decided to quickly pick it up and stuff it into my pocket before she reached her seat and turn around
i could think of two reasons why i did it first it was probably cuz there was a small candy shop across the street that i never had any money to buy anything second was cuz if the fact that i didnt really my rd grade teacher she was mean and turned my entire world of math upside i mean i had just perfected addition and subtraction and now youre gonna kick the plus sign over and ambush the minus sign with two periods and give us a  worksheet of  problems of multipliwhat and divihuhi sat there just completely confused i didnt even know these things existed soooo what i did was just take the two numbers and put them side by side as my answer and turned it in i got my results back and whaddya know i got one correct x
i was a cocaine addict for a few years a while back regular cocaine that is then i was an opioid addict for a few years too i recently had  months clean after going through a break up i was in a poor state of mind and decided to reunite with my old friendcoke dealer him and i had been through thick and thin in debt to the dealer in private sections of the clubs kicked out of our parents houses moving in our girlfriends to the drug spot hooked on heroin together withdrawal together you get the picture theres a lot of history there 

but anyways i arrive at his house to buy some coke come in its openn he yells from the living room as i walk in hes heating some mixture in a spoon with a torch lighter at the bottom i ask if hes shooting heroin or something to which he responds that hes cooking crack its better than coke bro its stronger bro it doesnt hurt your nose anyways i dont even do powder anymore i cook it up 

so of course my dumbass takes a hit now im walking around  weeks later with a kit for cooking in my bag hoping that ill be able to waste my money getting more im at outpatient treatment right now but just cant seem to shake the urge havent told anyone except my therapist
i have been torn up recently about this more than usual and i wanted to get this off my chest a couple years ago i really wanted attention from others at school this kid told about a video i wanted to be cool and edgy to try and get attention and be popular so i showed my friends a horrible and disgusting gore video and one of them almost snitched it still haunts me to this day remembering what i saw and the gutt reneging  feeling it gave me and it is always in the back of my mind reminding me of what i did and theres still a possibility that i could get in a ton of trouble if he remembers because we are still friends and he i think but im not sureforgot
when i was around  years old one of my younger friends who was around  or  came to my house for a sleepover she had this beautiful turquoise bracelet that i instantly fell in love with i asked her if i could trade it for one of my toys but she said no i offered her other things i had and practically begged her she still said no because her grandma had given it to her the morning while she was in the bathroom i grabbed the bracelet from her stuff and hid it in between my bed and my nightstand i planned to steal it because i wanted it so bad a few hours later when her mom came to pick her up she went to grab her things and began frantically looking for it my guilt kicked in so i started helping her look for it and then magically found it in my hiding spot i told her it must have fallen off my nightstand in between the bed and she never thought anything of it to this day i still am so glad i gave it back because she ended up moving away i never saw her again after that which meant i never wouldve had the chance to give it back
for context this kid with adhd was a complete asshole to many people me included he was racist ableist xenophobic homophobic transphobic and almost anything else under the sun he was so mean and collected all the infinity stones for types of discrimination against people

i myself am autistic and he has made demeaning comments about the disorder including discrimination against me during drama class he once even said

this is drama class not special ed class

i once later got him back but i dont feel that bad about it for some reason i once told him

at least i dont need pills to function

ironically now im about to have my th birthday im on pills for severe pure ocd and being assessed for probable adhd
i wish i could restart and do things correctly

my  year old self didnt understand that high school has an age limit

im not even sure if this is the right place for this 
i know no one cares thats part of the reason why i failed there was very little encouragement at home 

but if im being honest i just gave up because the assignments were too difficult for me i was a loner in school 

im not sure what i want people to tell me just be glad youre not me i guess 

thanks for reading this sob story its been on my mind for some time
some  years ago back as a crazy teenager that i was a buddy and i were out one night on a snowy evening we were going down a winding road and my car slipped into a ditch just so happened it was close to where there was some heavy machinery went to see what we could use to pull a car out of a ditch and found a truck keys were in it and after some efforts and smart maneuvering we were able to get my car out of the ditch truck returned no harm no foul right 
so i work in the er i had been feeling pretty nauseous that morning on my way to work but had no other symptoms so i just figured it was just from reflux or something i have a horrible time with it sometimes 

when i got there it was pouring rain i was walking in and then it hit me im going to puke i didnt want to throw up on the sidewalk because that would be super embarrassing so i ran to the grass 

i stepped on the grass and felt my leg snap and thats all i remember because then i passed out lol my coworker who was also coming in was like what are you doing are you ok 

i was like i think i threw up on myself if i even threw up i might not have gotten that far i think i hurt my ankle so more of my coworkers came out to put me in a wheelchair and i had to explain how this happened to the attending who is also my coworker 

i broke my tibia fibula dislocated my ankle and ruptured a ligament because i didnt want to be embarrassed by vomiting on the sidewalk i tell all my friends and fam i just slipped in the rain though 

best believe though next time ill just puke on the sidewalk 

oh and i never did throw up i guess snapping my leg in the process resolved that issue
this happened all the way back in my rd year of elementary school i had a crush on this guy and we were somewhat good friends one of my girlfriends befriended the same guy and they became super good friends they would talk all the time and ultimately i grew jealous thinking she was trying to steal him from me my last straw was when i saw them exchanging gifts after this i started stealing her belongings her family travelled quite often so she had a lot of keychains from different countries and some sentimental things as well from her school bag and either throwing them in the trash or taking them home as an act of revenge a few days later my mom saw a keychain of hers in my bag which was of a country we had never visited i told her i mustve accidentally put it in my bag and promised to return it to her and threw it in the trash the next day i never apologised to her and she never found out that i was behind all of this but i still feel terrible thinking about it
for context a few months ago me and my dad went to visit my grandma who lives on the other side of the city while i was snooping around my grandmas storage room i saw these rainboots and for whatever reason i decided to ask my grandma if i could have them now when i got the boots nothing seemed off i thought they looked quite normal and clean looking on the outside so i didnt bother trying them on

when we got home thats when i found out how wrong i was thank god i didnt put the boots on my dad did he felt something squishy and disgusting on his feet so he dumped the contents of the boots and then we saw there were baby rats mice sorry english isnt my first language inside each boot im not talking like  baby rats there were alot maybe like  in total they looked like they had just been born it was so horrifying and nasty some freaking rat had turned it into a nest of sorts

my dad immidiately thought about killing the rats and getting rid of them but i coudnt do it no matter how disgusting they were i still felt bad for them their mother was probaly frantically looking for them but my dad insisted of course i did not listen and i decided to dump the mice on the shallow part of neighborhoods canal system hoping they would survive i told my dad i had dumped them into the canal to drown them but i lied

now i forgot about this entire incident and i have even worn the boots on several occasions but recently i noticed a few rats scurrying around the neghborhood these rats we huge not new york city levels but still pretty huge they were as big as kittens i thought nothing of it but then i heard several neighbors complaining how there were rats inside their homes and thats when i connected the dots and realized those rats might have been the same ones i dumped a month ago

and thats pretty much it i live in a nicer area so our neighborhood was pretty clean up until those rats started scurrying around the streets in the garbage and in peoples houses even our house was no exception my mom screamed in the early hours of the morning and thats when i knew they had invaded our house as well people were getting mad and complaining and i am horrified the local government unit has already become involved and i think this is becoming a very big issue

the rats are everywhere now i seem to be the only one who has realized as my dad seems to be oblivious and i plan to keep it that way i know it might sound like nothing to you all but everytime i hear a scream in our neighborhood i do feel a little bad i seem to have made things just a little harder for everyone living here

edit

im sorry i may have given the impression i was a disgusting person for keeping the boots i grew up in a household where the furniture would be rearranged every sunday just to make sure every spot would be clean back then i just thought it was such a waste to throw them away when they were still usable i did deep clean them i used a shit ton of cleaning agents to make sure those boots were not nasty anymore before i even put them on my feet but yes i should still gave gotten rid of them
i have a condition called graves and its slowly been destroying my life i cant do the things i used to ive been living in constant pain but i also struggle with a rampant ed im huge overweight and struggling with restriction and emission my doctors dont believe me though ive been told i need to exercise and diet so i can return to a healthier weight because i have liver disfunction due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease i have a gym membership the last time i went to the gym i collapsed on the treadmill with a hr of bpm and had to be carried out by my partner im lbs no matter what i do i cannot lose weight and i cant figure out why i have graves gastroparesis nafld pots hyper mobility in almost every joint ibs and eoe eating anything makes me miserable 

my doctor told me that one of the major symptoms of graves is rapid weight loss in the beginning before they knew i had graves i had gone from  to  i was extatic then i started taking my meds and started ballooning up again so i stopped i was on a weight loss drug and it really helped silence the food talk in my head and i was able to eat and was happy but then my insurance denied a refill because they dont cover weight loss meds i dont know what to do i cant look at my meds and now even when i take them i involuntarily throw them up 

my endocrinologist told me i might need to have my thyroid removed because my levels are so dangerous theyre doing damage to my heart but if i have my thyroid removed ill have hypothyroidism and ill get even fatter idk what to do im so scared it took  years to get a gastroparesis diagnosis because i was fat i didnt get a graves diagnosis until i collapsed at work and the hospital doctor ran tests and caught it my primary care doctor told me she didnt want to run tests for hyperthyroidism because i was fat and being skinny is a symptom of it i have so much wrong with me i live in constant pain can hardly eat even when i want to am constantly vomiting even when i dont want to and im scared that if i dont lose weight im going to die from some condition they never thought to check for because im fat idk what to do im terrified
when i was no older than about  i was the biggest prankster in my school i pranked almost everyone including the staff with a fake  dollars one day i decided hey i should expand and then i gave a homeless woman a printed  dollars it was folded so she couldnt see the backside ive changed since then but just confessing since i still feel guilty for it
im not  sure this fits here but ill explain anyway if it gets removed so be it

almost two weeks ago i was at my brothers birthday party we had invited the next door neighbor among others to come have some lunch and celebrate neighbors friend was there visiting so we invited him too at one point the neighbor his friend and i were just sitting around bantering laughing and just joking around for the most part at some point i got distracted with party duties and stopped following the conversation but didnt want to appear rude so i sort of half chuckled when i thought neighbor and friend were telling a joke

well somewhere along the line the conversation turned from jokes and good vibes to neighbors friend mentioning his sick wife having just had an operation and taking a turn for the worse i didnt quite pick up on this change of mood until i laughed at what i thought was going to be the setup for a joke which just turned out to be this guys wife being in agony needless to say i fucked up and these guys left the party shortly after i hoped to god that they didnt hear me and this wouldnt affect good relations with them but after seeing them on christmas eve and meeting the wife in question who if looks could kill would have ended me in a heartbeat i can safely say that they definitely picked up on my laughter and now i will forever be known as that asshole who laughed at the suffering of a woman battling cancer i just hope that i havent also caused problems for the rest of my family now

edit for the people who suggest apologizing i hope i get a chance to do so something i didnt mention earlier in my post is that i live interstate and im only visiting family for birthdaychristmasnew years then heading back to my normal life in early january if i see the guy again i shall try to clear the air
the other week i was in the store and had a booger that was really bothering me i was walking around the ailes trying to not think about it but it made breathing really annoying i was over it so i decided to swipe my nose a few times to try and get it out i got it out and initially waited until it was dry enough to flick off onto the ground outside but i got impatient and realized that i was about to be next in line to check out and didnt want to accidentally hand a booger to the cashier 

so i found a price tag the kind that hangs over the edge of a shelf and swiped it back there
i take  enough for me to fall asleep for about  or  hours when i wake up at the morning and afternoon i probablt have brain damage from this which led me to think this would be a good idea and havent stopped in  weeks i hate taking pills but idc

edit i dont have depression im ok btw
not on purpose of course im not a fan of polluting the environment but i also cant pick individual beads of liquid metal from the yard

poor organisms wish i didnt do that 
i am a  year old girl i have been struggling with social anxiety for the last couple years recently the social anxiety has taken control of my life affecting not only myself but my family as well  
about  months ago i was having an especially hard day at weight training for my sport i convinced my mom i was going to throw up conveniently my older sister had just come home from school with a  hour stomach bug i faked catching this as well just thinking that everyone fakes being sick at some point i could only think to myself just one more day after a couple days i learned to vomit on command i knew i shouldnt do that it can have serious long term effects i cant stop now my mom still thinks i am sick i cant stand being full i cant do it  
now my mom has been very worried about me calling every pediatrician she knows i have had countless uncomfortable tests since then including blood draws urine tests breath tests celiac test and even an endoscopy for anyone that doesnt know that requires anesthesia i thought thats this would steer me away from continuing to pretend i have this illness now i have done hours of research abt the sickness to simulate that i have it im doing this all to avoid kids my own age  
i feel like i have gaslit myself into having symptoms or its from the drugs i take everyday that i dont need i feel extremely tired and achy my bones are tired i am actually vomiting everyday i hate vomiting but i cant stop im so sorry  
now im not going to pretend my family isnt well off because we are i feel like a privileged piece of shit with how much money my mom has spent trying to figure this out i hate myself for it but i cant stop i dont like how the drugs make me feel i dont understand why im doing this  
im tired
my stepmotherinlaw wont allow my fatherinlaw to eat anything with garlic or onions not even garlic powder or onion powder she claims that it hurts his stomach so whenever theyre in town and come over for dinner i refrain from using garlic or onions which is frustrating because i use those two in just about everything i cook   

for a little backstory about my stepmils cooking she makes the blandest food once we went to her thanksgiving dinner she cooked the turkey around noon cut it up and had it out around  but no one was allowed over until  pm by the time we arrived the turkey was cold af and drier than the sahara desert the woman just doesnt know how to make a tasty meal  

anyhow my fil visited us once without his wife and i made chicken breast with garlic and onion seasoning and he loved it nothing happened to him after he ate it he told me that he can eat garlic and onions if theyre cooked but for some reason when hes around his wife both of those ingredients are not to be used  

they visited before christmas and we planned a dinner at my house my smil made it a point to call me to remind me not to use garlic or onions she also called my wife to remind me not to use garlic or onions i was so annoyed that she made it a point to remind us not to use the two ingredients after years of her constantly reminding us that night i cooked the chicken breast with sage rosemary thyme garlic and onion powder both my smil and fil loved the meal in fact they commented on how juicy the chicken was and how delicious it tasted it turns out they both like garlic and onions but for some reason just have an issue with it also neither one of them got sick
me and my coworker are the first people to get to work why i was tired we have to be there before am and i have to wake up at am to get ready pretty early that i have to get up when i got to work i couldnt focus on my work because i was tired i also had lots of papers on my desk and they were unorganized my coworkers desk sits right behind me and my area and hers is separated by a wall she was talking to  people in her area and i started going where i was out her view and she couldnt see me first i stood by the wall and then i went to the corner and stood there i didnt want her to see me not working i had my arms tucked in my sleeves and i slowly started closing my eyes my coworker stopped midconversation and came over to my area she told me that those papers on my desk need to be organized and put away and theres work that needs to be done on my computer and then she told me to stop hiding she went back to the conversation she had with the  people

in year  or reception i was dangerously holding a scissors next to my head and decided to open and close it cutting a chunk of my hair i then saw it when pulling my hand to my face and stared in disbelief and started to cry when a teacher noticed me

 me being too embarrassed and scared to get in trouble decided to blame it on another girl who was walking around the classroom and was coincidentally holding a scissors that girl being my at the time friend got into so much trouble i couldnt look at her in the face all her recess for about  days was gone sounds less but any taken away recess can sound horrible so someone of that age and i witnessed her mother shouting in rage at her while she cried her eyes out

i never did confess mostly because it was almost  years ago and we lost contact when i left for secondary school i probably wouldnt have anyway it was always in the back of my head though the way nobody believed her and she got punished

this was my first post i hope it was okay 
i apologize if i misword any sentences since english isnt my first language and even if it was im not very good with words

ill begin with an introduction of myself im currently  years oldturning  in spring and going to my second year to last year of high school im a fairly good student who gets good grades on subjects i study foreign but average to bad grades on the i dont study for i dont have many friends and dont really like most of my other classmates since the only notable thing they do is smoke distrupt class and annoy me im basically a class loser no messages barely going out with friends and the friend i do have arent really good friends with me just barelythey arent bad its just we arent really close also i get barely any attention from girls no small talkno dates not even as friends just nothing i know most of these things are due to my cynical nature and bad personality but that doesnt matter i have a good family that did everything they could to give me a good childhood without me missing anything and im grateful for that im supposed to be christian i go to church with my family on sundays and go to sunday school every just i get even though i believe in god that doesnt automatically make me a good moral person like the others around me because im weak and cant keep myself from falling

so now lets get to what actually matters late june i came across a website that listed escorts strip clubs and brothels in my cityin my country brothels can be legal and regulated but most in the city are not only a handfull this website showed where these brothels are and reviews from their customers about their services i show that most of the illegal cheap brothels are nowhere near me in the city center but i was close to the more expensive legal ones now even though in my country its legal and im over the age of consent its still illegal for people under the age of  to go there i saww that there was one just a  minute walk from my house and fought with my self for the remainder of june and all of july of wether i go there or not nearly every day i passed by there with the intention of going but i chickened out and left i had decided twice that i wasnt going i would fall that far i would and could continue without it i decided to use that money to buy tickets for footballvolleyballbasketball matches in october when they started again and not to waste it there and lose myself in the process

but i didnt 

august nd it was a wednesday at about pm i went there again but this time i didnt leave i entered the place i ringed the doorbell and a middleaged woman with a strong accent greeted me there was another dude there a man with an even stronger accent than hershe barely understood what he said she lied to him saying i had called in advance and that he should leave and come back later she said to me the programs i could follow ranging from  the cheapest to  for the most expensive ones then came out another customer that had justed finished and the receptionist said goodbye to him after a short while i heard loud footsteps of someone wearing heels it was the prostitute she came down wearing only high heels and blueish green panties she had her long black hair in pigtails which i did not expect she was one of the very few women in the business who wasnt a foreigner she introduced herself let me get a good look at her and left after that the receptionist asked if i would stay i said yes and that i would take the cheapest program of  for  minutes she guided me upstairs to a roomi gave her the money she gave me a one time use towel and flip flops and said that the woman would take care of me and would be there in a few minutes i took off my clothes had a quick shower and waited after a short time the woman entered the room i was flabbergasted it was basically the first time i had seen a real halfnaked woman up close i will spare the details but basically i couldnt get erect due to my nervousness the woman got mad and left which left me also a bit mad but i also left without making a fuss 

after that i went home and then went to church a few days later we left for summer vacation on an island i couldnt stop thinking about it i felt guilt and shame for the entire month for context i also have an addiction to porn which has gotten better over the years but its still there i tried to quit that august for good but i failed after a few days in september i went back to that brothel and other brothels near it i just went to look i dont know why but i didnt do anything i didnt even have money with me now months later i finally confessed to a priest for what ive done it felt good and i the same time i stopped watching porn again its been three weeks since then 
but now i feel the temptation again i want to go back there i fantasize going back there i havent enter that website to look at it bcs i know ill fall again but its been eating me from the inside for the past week i want to be strong i want to be better but i am weak i hated my experience there but i liked it i vowed never to go back there but i did i never want to step foot there again but i long for the day i do and the worst thing the reason i havent gone back there again isnt because i can fight back and keep myself strong but because i dont want to spend so much money im a hypocrite i take some moral high ground from my classmates but compared to me they havent done anything so thats it im writing now here fighting to stop myself from going and planning when to go in the normal days i could keep myself busy and ignore the urge but now thats its christmas break i cant
recovering alcoholic here i was at a bar with my brother i had  left when my brother was leaving he left a  tip i took his ten and put my  where he was sitting and got  more beers out of it it was over  years ago ive been sober for  and still feel bad about it
i want to start this off by saying that this only works because i have three cars and there are four different mcdonald locations near me

sometimes i will drive to mcdonalds go around through the drivethru and then pull into the waiting parking spots that they have and just sit out there until an employee notices im out there an employee will be giving someone their food and then theyll come up to my window and ask me how long i have been waiting i say anywhere from  to  minutes and they immediately panic and ask what i had ill give them my order and then theyll give me food and apologize that they forgot about my food 

the next day i will go to another location in my car and do this over and over until ive been to all locations in that car and then the next week i will just switch cars and do it all over again one of the mcdonalds has caught on but the other ones have not 

i might be a bad person but im hungry when im coming off from work and they keep raising their prices
a friend and i were shopping at a big lot store in america  were canadian  he had  cases of beer in his cart and decided he only wanted one i returned the unwanted case to the isle it came from a woman with a clipboard and business suit starts telling me what i need to do next i repeatedly try to interrupt her with i dont work here she just talks louder and over me at first this was kinda funny that she was just going on and on but she became cruel and insulting with her words eventually she just waved me off and said  just follow me you think you can handle that 

waiting for the ultimate payoff here i decided to follow her  really thought this would turn into a funny story 

we get to a door that requires a swipe card to enter she snaps on me when i explain i dont have one cause i dont work here thinking this is going to be the moment she realizes shes an asshole and apologizesi was wrong 
she swipes her key card and and yells  just move thr fucking beer retard 

i dont like the r word 

i didnt have a plan in mind but figured id get her in shit by being in the warehouse so i went in alone just me with all these cases of beer 
so you need a key card to get in but not one to exit the back door 

i propped it open and started piling cases outside called my buddy to bring his truck around and we stocked it full and drove away 

its wasnt  percent free as we did have to pay duty at customs but thats pennies on the dollar 

its been  years and i still feel like im being watched when i return lol
feel free to trash on me all you want i deserve it for what i did i just need to get this off my chest

so i am a twitter user big red flag ik but an even bigger red flag is that im on shtwt and edtwt i struggle with mostly self harm and occasionally an eating disorder if i decide to not be a fat fuck and i post my sh because of course i do im an attention seeker and need the validation that my cuts are deep enough

and i have this friend who well call jessie me and jessie have been friends since elementary school currently we are in high school and i found out recently that they have been struggling with self harm occasionally i would get triggered or something when they would show their selfharm in public and talk to me about how cool and pretty it was but thats just me 

and one day i was talking about twitter and recommended that they join so that we could post together they made an account and joined and i showed them some groups to join and some people to follow i dont know why i did it and theres nothing i can do to talk it back because now they are eating less than  calories a day and saying that they are never going to eat a meal again

and the worst part is that even before they joined twitter they would talk about how my cuts were goals and we would encourage each other on our mission to get unhealthily thin i am a horrible friend and i want to kill myself right now but i probably deserve it to be honest i am a horrible person who does sick things like this
this is extremely serious
when i was around  or  i had just made a twitch account i am currently f
i had started frequenting twitch so i could make friends around the time covid happenedi had been playing fortnite with random people and became friends with a person called rogue
sometimes i used to watch his twitch streams and in his chat there was a guy named dylan who was also a regular teammate of ours i had become friends with dylan who also used to stream fortnite 
we used to frequently play together and i even started moderating for him he had maybe  followers at that time around middle of august  i had introduced him to  minecraft and he joined an smp which i had joined a few months earlier i didnt necessarily know any of them irl but we followed each other on instagram he quickly started frequenting that smp and we became decent acquaintances with the owner of the smp and her friend 
when i had started moderating for dylan he had told me apparently that he was using a voice changer since he didnt want people to find out he was old he didnt ever try to hide his age btw nobody had bothered asking and just assumed he was around our age and stuff and just wanted to play with people which was reasonable as people are very different online one day during a vc session his voice changer had turned off and the owner of the smpbarb and her friend heard it and made fun of him but they didnt do much after that 
one day when we were playing minecraft dylan was banned and his mc bedrock account had been reported for inappropriate behaviour and it turned out he had been banned from the discord apparently the two girlsbarb owner and friend had spread slander about him that he had been sending dick pics to them who are miinors which was a blatant lie a lot of people then reported him and his twitch and got it banned
 he was extremely heartbroken as he lost all his efforts on twitch as long as i had know him he was constantly using all of his money to grow his equipment and his twitch and spent almost every hour on his account after he lost the account he was super devestated  he rarely talked on his discord alr and he told me he was going to leave for a while and we didnt have much contact after that
a few months later during  the fortnite friend of ours rogue messaged me he had informed me that dylan had unfortunately taken his life i found out that day that dylan and rogue were brothers which was  new to me i had known rogue and dylan knew each other irl as dylan talked a lot about hanging out with rogue   dylan played fortnite because he didnt want rogue to play alone and started streaming to kill time btw rogue was also a minor 
 he had told me dylan had ended his life due to being basically banned on social media and being harrassed by the minecraft smp server owners brother and losing all his hard work on twitch i at that time had known the two girls identities and the brother had asked me if i did  but i said no this was due to the reason that i had a huge crush on the owner and was close to the owner barb we even online dated for a few months not thinking straight the reason i had broken up with the owner was also related to dylans death she had told me later that she and sam her friend had just done it as a joke because they thought he was a sad loser
i deeply regret not telling the brother rogue has also deactivated his socials
edit also for some more information rogue and dylan are not the same person jeez i knew rogue before dylan and i have seen pictures of rogue on his instagram we also played frequently as a trio so it was impossible for him to be rogue and dylan 
this post has been heavily edited due to me constantly trying to give more context 
this is probably a ridiculous thing to put here but i actually feel so bad about it back when animal jam was popular i got bored one day and decided to do trust trades now i did this completely with the intent to actually be someone trustworthy people kept trading me betas rares etc i kept denying that was until someone trust traded a spike at first i declined it but then that temptation set in when she traded it again i hit accept and teleported away it wasnt until i got my account hacked that i realized how much i actually mightve hurt that girls feelings the items i had were of no real value to me but i did work hard and trade lots to get them well most of them but when i got hacked and my stuff got stolen i felt a tiny pit in my chest i am so sorry to that girl i scammed and i just gotta say that spike was traded away with a full list of other spikes for a rare headdress that wasnt even worth it so i did get my karma 
back in  i was in community college and getting little school checks well i received a check for  no big deal i take it to the bank to cash it cuz im broke af and will take what i can get i get to the teller and hand her my check she puts it away and prints a receipt sitting it on the counter next to another receipt i guess she mixed them up bcuz when she started counting out the money and placing it in my hand it was way more than  i froze didnt say a thing and walked out with  i never went back to that bank gave my mom  my brother  and kept   i hope that teller found a good job after getting fired
its something that i am not proud of to this day i was on my way home from a school trip during the summer before my junior year of high school so this was roughly about  years ago i had gotten one of those glass bottles of starbucks mocha latte drinks from a pit stop well the school bus was driving right along when i finished my drink and so i decided to throw the bottle out of the window while the bus was still moving
i f stole something from my moms friend at her hold job  or f anyways i stole a toy at the time i was  or  idfk  but it was a toy car i still feel guilty to this very day if you have reddit and you see this im so very sorry
edit im now 
idk what it was but when i was in middle school this girl in front of me had long blonde hair and i remember one day just grabbing a pair of scissors and since nobody was paying attention i cut a little off i didnt even feel bad at the time and nobody said anything and she didnt even notice so i did it again and again and again until one day i went for the big snip and mid chop the teacher noticed but by that point it was too late the next time she came to school her hair was way shorter like a short bob from her hair being all the way down her back i got scolded by the teacher by my parents and the girl never sat in front of me again each person that sat in front of my was pretty wary and the teacher paid special attention to me but at the time i didnt even think i did a bad thing now as an adult i actually realize that was an insane thing to do and i feel a bit bad but idk what it is but i feel like i would do it again im not even sure i feel too much remorse but it was wrong to do its not something to find funny but its truly insane to look back on thinking about how i got scolded by my mom and she asked me why i did it and i told her idk no reason really just wanted to i cant help but laugh in disbelief in hindsight it feels like i was unhinged as a child and to the girl whose hair i chopped off for no reason i hope your hair grew back out and you completely forgot about me when i moved away
idk its that big a deal but it sucks to lie to an old friend
im using a throwaway account because i dont want my friends to find my main account

in th grade my family and i moved to another state because of a new job that my mother had gotten this was the first time in my life where i would be the new kid so i wanted to spice it up a little when i started school the next week and had to introduce myself to the class i decided to lie and say that i was a transfer student from the uk i had the british accent and everything

everybody was interested in being my friend since i was british and they asked me a lot about how school and life was in the uk instead of just giving up the joke then and there i went home and researched a bunch about the uk and came back the next day and explained everything i had researched and people actually believed me

my plan was to pull out of the joke after a few days but eventually i got too far in to actually stop i sometimes ordered british snacks from online stores and brought them to school for my friends to try my friends also gave me american snacks and i had to pretend that i had never tried them before

im in th grade now and all my friends and peers from that school still actually think im british i know this isnt as horrible as the other confessions on here but im feeling really guilty about lying about this for so long and need to get this off my chest as soon as i get home i switch back to my normal voice but sometimes i even have trouble switching back to my regular voice because of how much i use the british accent
 
i dont know what to do because i even lied and told my friends that im going back to the uk for summer vacation and they told me to send pics of my family down there when i go i honestly dont know what to do at this point i feel bad for lying this long but i feel like its been too long to pull out of this idk just needed to get this off my chest and maybe some advice
okay so i thought i was scamming temu but now im in debt not actually lmao but heres how the story went i had like  in my account and there was something i really wanted that was  so i thought oh well just see what happens so i bought it and looked at my account and i still had  in my account i was thinking huh thats strange but didnt think anything of it fast forward i get ten dollars so i do what any other irresponsible kid does i spent it as soon as i got it i bought the items but still had  so im thinking its probably not going through so i get the package but check my account and there staring right back at me was the crisp digits of  so im thinking this is an absolute miracle so i go ballistic buying stuff i could never imagine affording electric guitar and other items these packages are getting delivered but my money stays then one day i go to school absolutely balling with my temu accessories my mom calls me in the middle of class 

we just lost  dollars

i am absolutely shitting bricks i am so scared i tried canceling my cool ass orders but nothings working im freaking out my friends are laughing at me my moms screaming it didnt take  from my account it took it from my dearest mothers when i got home that day i was sworn never to see the light of day again

moral of the story dont try scamming temu

fuck guys i know about the title i just needed to make it longer
i have felt guilty about doing this one thing ever since i was a child i mustve been around  years old when my female cousin who was around  at the time showed me a trend on musically and it involved  people turning someone around i felt a little hesitant but i still agreed to do it so she suggested we did it to my little sister who was around  at the time and as we were doing it we must have missed a fundamental step in this stupid trend and my sister fell vertically on her head by a good couple inches and started crying recently i was talking to her about it joking that i gave her brain damage and she said she didnt remember the event but as we talked about it she said she suddenly remembered and said that immediately after it happened her mental imagery visualization decreased significantly to a point where she now hardly visualizes she still visualizes but the mental images are not strong after shes told me that ive been eating myself alive ever since i dont know how to live with myself now im not sure whether people would call this a disproportionate reaction all things considered she didnt completely lose her ability to visualize but the fact that i obeyed my cousin like that so easily and ended up decreasing my sisters quality of life has made me feel like shit and i dont know what to do
my friend f had really bad pms  short tempered crying at a random inconvenience super impatient  this starts the week before her period and lasts until a few days after so about  weeks out of the month  for the last few years shes had the suspicion that its from her hormones from her birth control shes also disappointed it didnt get rid of her periods like what usually happens she finally talked to a nurse about switching it out for a copper iud to which the nurse said oh no your brand of iud isnt supposed to affect any of that  your periods not supposed to go away and none of the iuds should affect your mood  i wouldnt dare do it out loud but i had a good chuckle when she called us after crying about how its not her hormones and that shes just a bitch  i feel bad for her but im also tired of her using her period as an excuse to be mad half the time we talk and hang out

edit so shes currently on kyleena not mirena  the nurse said kyleena is not meant to stop your period just lessen them hers are as frequent as before but lighter  i used to have mirena and switched over to copper just because i used to get super hot flashes  she used to be on the pill but with her adhd and depression shes medicated for both she didnt take it  consistently which ended up with a big pregnancy scare  she wanted something with less maintenance so planned parenthood suggested an iud  the only reason she hasnt switched to copper yet is because how much it hurt being put in and then having it removed and a new one inserted when the first one started slipping out after a year  she fully plans on getting it removed and having kids in the next  years with her partner
shes aware shes a bitch  the laughing was just the delivery of the line i am just a bitch the post is here because she doesnt need to know i secretly actually agree with her instead of the usual oh no youre fine good ol pms haha
the next time she seriously complains about her mood swings i will bring up pmdd but i also know shes discussed this with two different nurses at pp and her mom her aunt and my mom who are also nurses  they both think its just regular pms not related to her birth control  weve all just agreed she can be a bitch
idk why but back when i was younger i used to steal a lot ofc i stopped but the worst thing ive ever stolen was a weird leap frog thing i forgot exactly what it was but they took game cartridges like game boys do i remember it was the end of the day and we were waiting to get released to go to wait for the buses and i seen it and the teacher was busy so i picked out my favorite game and grabbed the only different one and put it in my bag and i took it home my mother did ask where i got it from i told her a friend gave it to me and she just believed me i still have it till this day and it still works and ive never said anything
so i live in an pretty big city with about  million people and we an amazing public transport system expect for the pricing a few years ago it was about  for an ticket that you could use on any bus train or boat in my city but every year they increase the costs for an ticket now its   now if i have to get from and to work every day thats about  and well thats just out of my budget so for the the past  years ive been illegally trespassing the vehicles now let me tell you about how all of the vehicles work the trains are the easiest to get into for free as you just have to jump over the half door or wall behind someone paying now the busses are a bit more complicated here you have to use social engineering by telling the buss driver you either forgot your wallet or dont have enough money and really need to get home or you could use the doors at the end of the bus but the driver will almost always ask you to leave and this is very shamed upon and the boats are almost impossible to get into without paying as there are always guys at the entrance checking for tickets

now im not the only one illegally getting onto the public transport vehicles theres a lot of people doing it

recently ive been just walking to work but this takes about an hour and i hate riding a bike so thats not an option

edit typo
so you know those movies or videos when the quiet girl finally makes friends with some popular kids and they make them do things they dont wanna
yeah
so we were at the family dollar buying some snacks for things and my friend grabs a bad of condoms opens the box and puts the condoms in her pants she also grabs some light up baloons and puts them in her pants as well i did the same thing i knew we wouldnt get caught but i was a little nervous i know what we did was wrong but it was fun to blow up the condoms into balloons and give them to her brother lol dont steal kids its bad and definitely dont allow people to pressure you into things
i do it rather you are doing something to attract attention to yourself or not i stare at you what you guys may misunderstand about this you might think im staring off into space thinking about something and accidentally stare at someone thats not the case im actually present and looking at them heres times i do it in public when im walking past everyone i always look at everyone walking by me instead of looking straight or not at anyone in school id always stare at my classmates around me now i graduated high school and im in the workplace now 

i stare at my coworkers at lunch walking past them and at their computers heres something else when somebody has a profile picture of themselves i always like to zoom in on it and stare at it rather he or she sometimes i like to screenshot the image and have it for later i go back to it in my gallery and stare at it every now and then
i threw a drink through a ladys open car window

if was around  and leaving my work this woman was driving recklessly weaving off of the road to get around people and then stopping in front of them and proceeded to run me off of the road when i got back on the road behind her she kept slowing down and acting like she was moving off of the road so that when id try to pass her she would try to hit my car 

the one lane then split into two a straight lane and a right hand turning lane i decided to go straight no one was behind me and the person in front of her was taking forever to turn im assuming they didnt realize the light was green my windows were down and so was her drivers side window i chucked my fountain drink from my lunch break through her window and went straight 

for context im usually a very patient person to the point where someone could be a straight up asshole to me and ill think to myself are they okay they must be having a bad day and ill let it go but something in me that day just was not having it 

i know what i did was wrong believe me as i was driving off i immediately thought maybe that wasnt the right thing to do im not saying what she did was right either i mean its not like she was weaving around people because of an emergency if she had time to sit there and fuck with people right 

i dont know its been something ive been going back and forth on in my mind whenever i happen to think about it
im working a temporary job over christmas at some childrens playroom event and were forced to hand out these leaflets to customers none of them ever wanna take them so we dont give them out often but our management said they would cut our pay if we had leftover leaflets each week 

so i started shoving a bunch of them in my underwear and throwing them away during toilet breaks to meet the quota
i bought two  gift certificates from the mall went to the copy shop bought some really nice paper stock and made like a hundred copies with the color copier and then went on a shopping spree

the reason for  gift certificates was because they had serial numbers and i didnt use the same serial number twice in one store

back in those days if you bought something that was  with a  gift certificate they would give you  change in cash

the ps was more than  so i used  gift cards and my ill gotten gains to cover the difference
i have a gluten intolerance and ive been eating wheat based foods as a way to hurt myself ive been doing this on and off for some time now and i find that when my muscles and tissues still hurt weeks after other methods that this is the best way to get the pain and discomfort i need to get me through that momentday im fully aware that its not healthy and im doing long term damage to my body i have no answers i have no excuses i know i need professional help i cant afford it right now but the second i can i will be seeking it
on  nov after careful planning and preparation i m failed in my attempt to die

for more than  months ive been trying to live after i decided in  that i wanted to die in oct  i concluded definately that i want to die 

im married for y with  daughters and coown a couple of businesses we started after exiting successful corporate career of y

dying was something i communicated since oct to my wife i made the decision and commitment that my death wont be a trauma event shooting  hanging etc  linked to discovery of my body i found the right medicine to achieve the outcome required a simple go to sleep medicine

i asked friends whom i had confided in to help my wife after my death with running the businesses making decisions and setting my wife and kids up for a better life after my death  we spent a couple of hours together before  nov where they asked me details relating to the businesses and how my wife wanted to be helped to enable them all to help my wife after  novshe was in the session as well

ive been socially distant in home life i didnt want to partake in fun events and was happy to be left alone in house full of people we did not want my kids to know at this point in their lives i decided to die and started explaining how my blood pressure and heart was giving drs concern  trying to lay path of heart attack as cause of death to them 

ive been diagnosed with depression y and refused to be exposed to treatments that artificially make me come across as happy  i believe in being authentic and chemical  medicine treatment alters me perhaps in the most respectful way possible it is similar to me refusing treatment for terminal illness i just dont want treatment i have a strong  do not ressusitate  living will form in case medical decisions must be made

in my life ive had sleep therapy shock therapy range of different antidepressants and anxiety medicines natural treatments and even with these fully amped up  i rationally and cognitively decided to die and communicated this to my close friends and wife 

i confirmed with my financial advisor that all financial instruments are in good standing and my wife will have millions to start new life i spend weeks preparing with her what that life could look like and how embracing it is important or my dying will not achieve the better life i want for her and the kids 

im clear that me being half living irritable and reclusive is not in any of their interests im doing harm by being this way amongst them

i prayed with a preacher for my sins there are many  and for forgiveness of what i was going to do  nov 

i said goodbye and blessed my wife on her new journey and wished her a joyful loving meaningful and purposeful life we had a peaceful ending

and then i made a mistake in how i took my medicine to avoid gagging or vomiting on the metallic taste of the medicine i consumed it with something that impacted the effectiveness silly mistake and i should have know better

the real issue is the  weeks since people that knew and was part of the day on  nov especially my wife  dont know how to react or engage with me to be honest it took me a proper week to starting thinking again having resolved that im dying i had no future plans thoughts or intentions i had nothing

they had nothing for me as i was not suppose to be there

given how hard its been over  weeks to find connection with especially my wife again  im clear and resolved that i should see through what i had started and die i cant blame my wife as the future world i promised her after my death was compelling not having it now must be disappointing 

what ive learned
 if ive decided to die do it  dont mess it up its really hard for people to adjust to you living if they were prepared that you were dying
 as good as i thought it was to prepare people that im choosing to die most people do not know how to respond to that scenario
 dont tell my wife that its happening eg at this time on this day the emotional distress is too much rather let the natural instinct and reaction be her guide
 being comfortable to die is not easy process for those that are continuing to live to accept or understand
 making a mistake and not die was not a scenario any of us were prepared for
 even if people say they dont judge they do being around after mistake of not dying means you are around to be the object of their emotional distress and anger aimed at you  to be honest thats fair  i did after all cause the state of things 
 dont promise people that youve decided to live if you havent committed to yourself
 being in limbo is hard no one is reaching into your world to help as youve done good job at communicating your decision 
make this in between time as short as possible   weeks is too long as nothing changed i have before and after in my consciousness but with nothing changed in mind or action im in a world similar to being a fish out of water i dont belong anymore

the post is to express my experience and not to gather advice or seek support in living its the only place i could think of sharing reflections on my journey
 
thank you for this opportunity

edit 
the number of people responding surprised me and out of respect i wanted to validate and engage as many replies as possible 

each of the replies took time and i value what was expressed even if i do not fully agree 

this has however taken substantially energy from me and im exhausted ill not be responding further until ive recharged and taken stock of all the feedback

thanks to all for the messages
y guy and im lying to everybody including me im lying to my parents about school my skills my thinking im lying to my friends about everything i can do like i told them i could do this that and that i am strong ive been lying about my mental health ive been telling them that i was so down about to breakdown but it was all false even my closest family believe that can i do so much stuff the worst part is that even if i know that i should speak up before its late im still saying nothing because im scared and affraid toi but now im stuck stuck with my reality because everybody thinks that im so good with everything and some of my friends started to speak about me to some people and know even more people believe it yesterday a guy came to me to ask about my fighting skills i said nah bro too busy but im just a guy who never fight in my whole life im just a liar that has to live the life he created so i wanted to speak about it online where nobody can know who i am  
thank you for listening to this shit excuse my poor english
when i was in college i was struggling and got poor grades to the point that i decided to lie to them about it despite me working a part time job my parents were paying my tuition and basically everything everytime theyd ask me hows uni id tell them fake marks even though i was close to academic probation one semester i couldnt tell them anything about my struggles otherwise theyd pull me out of university so i decided to drop out without telling them and get a cdl at a nearby community college which i fully funded myself and ive been working as a truck driver ever since
grew up in a shit home with a mormon karen for a mom no father mom never liked me she later died in my arms at  and i tried to revive her but was unsuccessful no parents at  and spiraled into incredible depression and now im  no wife no kids i recluse as much as i can and this year ive tried to commit the big ol s multiple times either i was too scared or i just woke up vomiting i think my coworkers and friend are all either oblivious or dont care 

im not really wanting sympathy even though it sounds like it mostly it just feels nice to finally say it thats all

edit i honestly wrote this fully expecting nobody to give a shit and i was wildly surprised im so sorry if i havent replied to your comments but i promise i have read every single one and i thank you so so so so much for taking time to write such nice things 

im taking the advice to see a therapist asap even though its a very scary thought to me i realize that its possible that my depression could be helped even a little with medication also getting a good hobby that i can put some effort into 

i have to admit that after writing this i had a fullblown panic attack and cried for a while i am just at a low point possibly the lowest point im so sorry for making everyone worry and i am going to return the favor and try to better myself immediately i will keep anyone updated who wishes to know again thank you so so so much 
i used to work at a job that had me open and close the building me and a few others had access to the keys but other workers were not to be trusted with them because theyve let in friends before opening time and locked the doors while their friends were still inside this key it looked just like my apartment building key 

one day i went into my building and into my apartment and i noticed i was using my workplace key i was shocked but i wasnt surprised the keys looked the same and the ridgesteeth were fairly similar during winter break i decided i wanted to fuck around so when i noticed that majority of my building had left to go home and multiple days i would hear no one or see no one on my floor i unlocked my next door neighbors door it unlocked but i was afraid someone was home so i slightly opened the door and went back to my apartment for several hours around am i went to go check if the door was still open and it was so i let myself in i looked around they had nice things usual college guy stuff football flags gaming consoles camo design furniture i walked around their apartment for a bit i went into everyones room except one because it was locked when i was done looking around i got scared someone was home because a door was locked and i dont know if anyone would walk in so i quickly ran out and back into my apartment i didnt lock the door before i left but i assumed i could do it when i woke up 

when i woke up all i could think about is if i got caught i couldve went to prison would it be my work places fault for providing a building key thats actually a master key to my apartment or would it be my fault for attempting all these questions popped up in my head like what wouldve happened who couldve been home if i did something specific would i have gotten caught etc later around am again i went to go check the door and it was locked i was terrified someone probably was home

before i quit my job i told my boss the building key can get into my apartment but not my room that was a lie so that maybe theyll install a new lock or a new door and change they keys my job was near campus and my apartment is on campus so the chances of someone else finding out is possible   am just glad i didnt get caught but i wanted to share this because even though it is dangerous i laugh about it because i am stupid i dont know why i tried to fuck around and find out i really tried to ruin my life i think of scenarios of being caught and i get frightened terribly when i do that even just writing all of this was hard 
i went to a large party with around  people and there was pizzas in the back of the room for everyone to eat and my hungry ass ate and picked the pepperoni off of all the pizzas just to clarify theres was  pizzas
this week im training as a barista in a coffee shop so i can get extra hours  i actually really like the job and while it can be hectic at times it can be kind of fun

yesterday i found out that we ran out of regular espresso beans which was a problem since most of our drinks needed espresso  at first i was told to tell customers we were out of it and offer other options but this made people upset and drove business away so my boss eventually told me just to use decaf espresso and not tell customers about it according to my boss were completely out of regular espresso and probably wont get anymore for a few days due to shipping delays so to avoid conflict we have to use our decaf instead 

im an honest person and it bugs me to keep my mouth shut about it  i even told this to my parents and they were really upset that i would lie to people about this and warned me that eventually someone would figure out the difference  i feel so guilty about it but at the same time theres not much i can do  a coffee shop without caffeine is like a bakery that doesnt sell bread and wouldnt look good for my company  but lying is also something that goes against my morals and i just feel wrong staying quiet  all i can do is add extra espresso and hope it makes it a bit stronger but its all im able to do

i wonder if this is something other coffee shops do  ive never worked in one before so i dont know the common problems a coffee shop would deal with or if they would have to make a choice like this
so when i was a kid i didnt get much attention from my parents because i was homeschooled and didnt need as much help academically as my siblings so i ended up being on my own most of the time i usually got attention by throwing fitstantrums so bad that they simply could not be ignored and it worked but i hated how my family hated me because of my tantrums and how i couldnt be taken outside of my house because my parents believed i would throw a fit over something smallwhich was fair because i did often do that 
anyway i knew my mom was and still is very religious and believed in guardian angels and that she was very naive and gullible so i decided i would tell her i saw angels at night and that they talked to me and stuff like that she ate it up no question and for a while i got a good amount of positive attention because of it until she eventually forgot about it or didnt care anymoreor at least thats what i thought she did turns out she remembers and now shes even more religious and is super into prophets and healing prayer and spiritual gifts and believes that because i was visited by angels i must have some gifts or blessings from god of some kind ive tried telling her i made the angel thing up for attention but she doesnt believe me because apparently a kid as young as i was i was around  wouldnt be able to make up a lie like that its getting irritating because she tells people im blessed or something but im not and she refuses to believe me when i say it never happened and now i have this weird mix of guilt and anger and im just not sure what to do or even if i should do anything at all i guess i just wanted to rant about it because i feel like my mom is crazy and is obsessed with the idea of one of her kids having powers from god and i am the kid she chose to project her delusions on she puts a lot of pressure on me to have these abilities that are impossible and inhuman and she tries to drag me into her church groups and spiritual circles because she thinks i have some connection to the other world but i dont have the ability to do what she wants me to do nor do i care enough to even pretend like i can do this stuff because im just so fed up with her spiritual crap 

also as a side note my mom calls my familys history of mental illness a generational curse and she thinks my battles with depression that ive had since childhood are spiritual attacks and she uses my mental illness as proof that im spiritually gifted because according to her i would not be attacked if i wasnt powerful i think shes kind of insane to be honest
roughly a month ago i was driving home from work when i stopped at a red light a van with a couple of builders pulled alongside me they seemed to be joking around looking at me i made eye contact with the passanger who was pretty good looking who mouthed to me
flash with a cheeky wink afterwards im not sure what came over me but i felt excited and a little turned on for some reason i turned away for a second to think then looked back at them ilifted up my top with both hands i didnt have a bra on and flashed them for a few seconds before smiling the light turned green a moment later and i drove off
i was pretty excited as i drove home i thought it would be a fun little secret however ive been debating over the last week if i need to tell my boyfriend weve been together over  years now and i do see a future with him i feel slightly guilty as im not sure he would find it funny or take it badly
so this happened i was in grade eight

so first i found a plastic pepsi botle with some juice filled in it then procceded to just take it everywhere with me since i thought i could get atleast  cnt of the deposit

procceded to get to my last class 

class hour i dont know if other countries have this its where the teacher assigned to take care of you all has a chat with you about importantrelevent stuff

after she is done talking i am given a piece off paper where i am supposed to input my grades and sorts to show that i am aware off my shitty grades
so everyone leaves since the lesson is finnished then the teacher too since she was taking documents to another place

so there i am alone with a pepsi botle with juice in my hand begging to be emptied

so i procceded to open the third floor window and wait for  seconds if i could hear anything i could not see the bottom since of the thick structure of the school
 seconds pass silence well time to pour it

then poured said juice and then splash silence for a solid  seconds

and then i heared  girls around  grade scream 
aaahhhhh

then out of fear i quickly closed the window put the givven paper on my teachers desk took my shit and left the school

worst thing its the cold season like now wich reminded me of this event

if i remember some snow fell off the window too after i quickly shut it due to the wind force and vibration


poor girls
so in my pe class we had a substitute one day and she was in the locker room nothing out of the ordinary but when she was walking out she just stopped and stared at breasts in only a bra and kept staring even while walking out of the locker room im i being dramatic or do i have a right to feel uncomfortable
this maybe isnt as bad as some but ive been feeling guilty about it lately about a year ago i was at a very crowded bar with my friends in the city the basement bar area was wall to wall with people i waited for probably  minutes at the bar to order a drink there was a loud group of douchey looking men in front of me theyd ordered a ton of drinks were rude to the bartender and i heard them make multiple disgusting sexual remarks about her i finally got up to the bar after theyd paid and their receipt was still out it was a tab of over  and theyd written  in the tip line i didnt see them put any cash in the tip jar i added a  quickly to make the tip  realistically i know they probably did not notice the extra  charge on their account i didnt really feel too bad about this until i told a group of my friends about it recently during a drinking game and they all made really judgmental faces would i do this again probably not and not because i dont think they deserve it but more because i value not getting in trouble and what i did was illegal i also wouldnt want to jeopardize the bartenders job or have her be accused of theft when it was me
i dont have much of spare cash but ive enough to buy necessities and nice stuff sometimes yesterday i went walmart pharmacy and i had to go through the candy section i noticed that couple of packs of turtles original were open and i just took one and put it in my pants to eat later on ive shit load of chocolates at home because i bought a couple of packs during the halloween sale im not eating those but i want to steal and eat i generally dont have shoplifting issue and generally my moral compass has been good like id help out friends and family regularly try to donate to charities not much but like  here and there the worst is i dont know for sure if id not be doing this again in my  years of life ive done this for the second time what the heck is wrong with me
this one is definitely more light hearted confession than some of the other posts ive seen this may sound like a joke post but i promise its not 

but back in year  secondary school uk so th grade for americans i sat next to this girl in science lets call her ag asthmatic girl

she had severe asthma like super bad she had been picked up from school in an ambulance because of it kind of bad

it got set off by any kind of smell or temperature of air

one time we were sitting in science and i suddenly really needed to fart i completely forgot  she was asthmatic and i farted you couldnt hear it but it must have smelt because in like thirty seconds she was coughing and had to stand outside the classroom with her inhaler

i consider this story my personal ticket to hell
i felt guilty for a week  i couldnt stop pouring cereal and silk  i still cry when i think of it
when i was  my buddies and i would drive around friday and saturday nights shooting out windows with a wrist rocket and rocks or marbles we fucked up cars houses disposable homes buses schools offices stores anything with glass within  yards of the road it was perfect since other vandals used bb guns and no one expected a rock coming through their living room window to have anything to do with a car driving by on a busy road id say i scored a glassshattering hit  of my shots sometimes from  feet away going  mph perpendicular to the targeti hit the metal siding of a disposable home single wide trailer at  pm one night and the bedroom light came on immediately it sounded like a car crash from my viewpoint at  mphso we waited until  am and hit it again with identical results
when i was in like th grade maybe th i told one of my friends who was obsessed with bts that jin was my cousin and all of the bangtan boys and i talked often there was also this fake app that had voice clips of them talking so you could pretend you were calling them so i used that and she obviously believed it because we live in texas and our asses did not know how to speak korean looking back no harm done and it was kinda funny but everytime i listen to them i cant help but think if she still thinks that i havent seen her in like  years lmao
i mean for the last year im leaving abroad and im having some hard time financially not really because i have supporting parents and i just need to ask them and they will help me but it feels weird and needy to ask for money everytime im trying to live here on my own 
everytime im going to the supermarket im finding myself stealing at least one product if its a chocolate or fruits or meats but sometimes even more then  of my carts value i keep my boundaries only to the big places like supermarkets and big stores so private people wont truly get hurt i dont know if i like the danger or if im just being cheap dont know how ok it is or not just needed to get it off a bit
when i was in middle school we had a swimming pool with a really powerful water jet the teacher allowed us  mins at the end of class to mess about and all the boys in my class would line up and take turns leaning into the jet we called it getting the feeling and ive always thought it was good of my teacher to never embarrass us by letting us know he knew which he obviously did id like to thank him if i ever see him again haha
i am a medical research physician our research is chemotherapy based and so my patients have gone thru their first cycle and were at a phase where they experienced adverse reactions of chemo usually there are no big issues but last night one of the participants who was experiencing diarrhea started shivering after she got a iv drip  at home

the thing is i suffer from migraines and i just take a heavy painkiller and go to sleep otherwise it gets worse i took med at  and went to sleep around  i wake up after i feel my phone vibrate it was the patients son i should have picked it up but i looked at the phone and put it away instead

she is fine her iv was cold hence the shivers

i feel mortified i feel terrible i have never done something like this before never ignored a patient and its just eating me up inside
when i was in intermediate school middle school for the americans wed have this night market type shit at my school where youd sell the food your classmates made to fund the trip i remember they made nachos or something mexican i dont remember anyways fast forward to the next day i saw the jar filled with   all types of bills in that jar 

i really wanted all that money to buy some weed so i just stole it and ran home when i arrived to school the next day everybody in my class was freaking out because if they didnt find the money they would miss out on going to camp long story short they didnt find it and ended up having to miss out

this story isnt as bad as most of the ones ive seen on this subreddit i didnt regret it at the time but now i feel bad for making my classmates miss out on making memories and having fun
we went abroad and i was sharing the room with other  boys 
there was this good boy who was a bit slow bless him but i considered one of my only friends in my class and we were always smiling and joking
the journey to get to the hotel was  hours by bus  and i cant use public restrooms so the whole trip i couldnt do a number  on the shared bedroom it was me this friend of mine and another guy who was kind of a bully
we entered the room and i really needed to go to the restroom but we were all euphoric and for a sec there i didnt feel it anymore i dont remember the details very well anymore since its been a long time all i can remember is that the bully jokingly grabbed this friend of mine and was holding him down on the bed my friend was laughing and shouted at me to do something at him since he had him trapped he couldnt move nor cover his face with his hands the only things i remember is that i was there and i immediately thought  would be so fricking funny if i would fart on his face in matter of a couples of seconds i jumped on the bed dropped my pants squatted and made a huge fart on his face i would have never imagined that with the fart something else would have come out but it did it wasnt much but it was wet me and him never had the same relationship anymore and i think he started hating me from that moment i regretted it since so much
ever since i was a teenager i loved the idea of being somewhere im not supposed to alone especially when its a place somebody livesworks i always wanted to just be in peoples houses when they werent home just walking around seeing how they live nothing sexual i dont raid panty draws or look for money or take anything it was just something about knowing people live there and im like a ghost walking around this interest lead me to urban exploring for same reasons theres something so strange about being in a place that was once so busy and full of life that is now dead  


anyway a few months ago i was visiting my mom for the night and she had told me the neighbours had gone away for a few nights and she had keys to feed their cat turn on lights just make sure everything is safe later that night she was sleeping and i was sitting there when i saw they keys and the wonder of being in somebody house came to mind i picked up the keys went and let myself into there house nothing juicy i just walked around in the dark looking in their rooms and checking there fridge just to see what others enjoy i stayed in the house for maybe  minutes to a hour just in silence   


i know this could sound very creepy but there really isnt any intent other then wonder i suppose i dont know these people very well although it wouldnt make much difference either way but its something thats always in my head about being in other peoples homes even stores when your not supposed to be and its empty 
so i was beating my meat well not really bcz you cant beat your meat if youre a girl anyway mum caught me masturbating and she said
oi what are you doing and i said im really itchy sorry then she gave me smth to put on my yknow it was so annoying bcz i had my door open a little bit and i didnt hear her come out of her room

ajjshshsjsb
i know asl would like to point that out i was walking into a store and saw a teen going around the parking lot selling candy i really didnt want to engage with them so i just kept walking 

they approached me and started talking so i immediately paused and began signing that i was deaf i thought that if i indicated i couldnt hear they would leave me alone didnt work they kept pushing me and asking if i was interested but again i kept signing and indicated i couldnt hear them 

eventually they gave up and walked away

still dont feel real good about it
i started working for a company during the pandemic and everyone was working from home that is until the return to office emails started circulating saying that attendance would be tracked and refusal to come in would result in disciplinarydismissal the company has tried to implement other draconian policies in the past that people just refused to do and these dictats pretty much always went away in the end so i tried my luck and i just continued working from home

i found out that other colleagues were getting constant reminders and threatening emails if they didnt turn up for their allocated days but i recieved nothing a fairly large number refused to come in and were either let go or found new jobs before they were let go the company is still losing many people and it seems like soon theyre only going to be left with graduates and top level managers

i didnt understand why i was being left alone until i was on a call with one of the managers and the conversation of losing lots of staff came up he said they werent smart like you and didnt ask for a wfh contract when they started the only thing is that i never had a wfh contract and i never told anyone i did

technically i didnt outright lie but he had somehow gotten the impression that i had a work from home contract and i just didnt correct him at that moment i realised why i had not met the same fate as other colleagues

im leaving the company now anyway because ive found a better job with full time wfh written into my contract  better pay and benefits 

its been just under a year since they started trying to force attendance and it seems like ive managed to get away with it if i stayed at the company im sure i would eventually get found out by someone who bothered to actually investigate but i guess ive never raised any red flags because my work has always been good quality completed on time and ive never caused a ruckus

ill be glad to start my new job and not have the fear of being found out in the back of my mind i do wonder whether theres anyone else in my current company that has had the same thing happen to them they wouldnt exactly announce it to everyone
i needed somewhere to say this because it has been eating at me for too long and i cant tell anyone in real life in fear of being arrested or something my friend broke my trust by getting with my boyfriend but when i caught her i played it cool and acted like i didnt know then led her to my house and drugged her and beat her i threw her in the woods and called the cops and she lives but was badly hurt dont tell me im a bad person because i already know i am and this isnt the first time ive went too far with revenge
i m have been lying ever since ive been born i lied so i wouldnt get into trouble with moderate success due to my ethnicity ive been excluded and discriminated against by my peers up untill highschool my habit of lying to get out of trouble spread to also be a way to socialise and to get friends since im otherwise very socially inept in truth ive done nothing with my life except waste it away behind the computer screen because there was nothing else for me to do that turned into a way for me to cope with my errors all social circles ive been a part of i have consistently been lying to in order to put me in the better position im currently in  social circles one is from college and the other is an online social circle about  ish months ago i first spoke to this person that i genuinely cared for in my online circle theyre an amazingly kindhearted person and i have nothing but respect and compassion for them due to their behaviour even though the circumstances they live in are pretty bad we chatted and i decided to keep them company for a while since even though theyre a part of the same social circle i am theyre also struggling to feel connected with anyone so over the months i lie about myself and suddenly i start feeling guilty i made myself up to be this wonderful person and i feel awfull for doing so to cope with that i have actually begun taking the steps to be more like how i describe myself i began eating normally again i am taking better care of myself than ever before i couldnt have been bothered to help out anyone that needs it when i spot them but now i actively go out of my way to do so with that being said my guilt isnt going away i still feel like an awful person for having lied about myself and made a false image about myself for people that i actually care about now but im in a position where if i were to come out and tell the truth id definitely lose everything i have now and its precisely because i did find my people that i found the motivation to do anything i know that theres almost always a way to be forgiven for your mistakes but i still dont forgive myself the things i lied about are irredeemable and things have gotten so badly that i start believing my own lies as an example i genuinely get upset when people makes jokes about stuff i previously lied about being sensitive over im loosing my sense of self because i genuinely never had anything remarkable about myself and now i oh so desperately want to be the image i made others believe to be me i dont fucking know what to do at this point i know continuing to lie about myself in order to save my friendships is the selfish thing to do my friend is still dependent on me and my social circle is the reason im finally beginning to somewhat improve on myself too
saw a simmilar story figured i would add mine i was a teenager working at marcos pizza as a delivery driver online delivery orders would come in and i would notice that they didnt use a discount that we had 

so i found this glitch out by mistake we would run dailyweekly discounts and i saw that the customer had ordered two large specialty pizzas but did not receive the discount so before delivery i decided to go up to the kiosk and update their order i was hoping it would save them some money 

i dont know why but im guessing because the transaction was already complete the discount that i would apply just ended up in my bank at the end of the night i didnt work there long fired for forgetting a cheesy bread but i made between  and  extra dollars per delivery every online order that didnt use the discounts we had 

at first i thought i was stealing from marcos but then i realized that if i canceled the order and put it in correctly the customer would have been able to keep a few dollars i do feel bad about stealing the money even if it was only a couple hundred total thanks for reading guys marcos fix your crap
when i was  i worked at wendys  this was in the early s and we were still using old style cash registers with a black screen and green letters  

anyway all of the prices were easy to remember and we would simply take orders and on easy ones we just wouldnt ring it up and pocket the money 
 
you didnt want to make it too obvious so it was a secret between just a few of us employees  i would close on friday and saturday nights and would always leave there with a  dollar tip every night  

i know it was wrong but we were kids  no excuse i know
this summer when i went to the sea there was a car parked about km from my hotel that had been hit probably in an accident 

the rear window was broken and i saw a box in the trunk i took it as i continued walking and when i got to the hotel i opened it there were some fake shoes that i didnt need

on the box was written the address they were for so i left the box with the hotel owner telling him that i found it on the street and i want him to return it if he can he said of course he will do it

i just hope it got back to whoever i stole it from
when i was in elementary and middle school my grandma used to beat me when i got home from school for no reason i am autistic and didnt know how to express my emotions so i would have tantrums quite frequently and my parents nor my grandmother knew of nothing to console me i would only have them at home because i was a mute child in school 

after awhile i would take money out of her wallet or anything i found around the house and spend it on candy at school it became so bad that i stole  one time and i tried to spend it at the school book fair and my teacher had called my grandma she was not happy and she beat me for it i stopped around my eighth grade year 

my mother ended up moving into the house when i was  my grandma told her she could live there in hopes she would help fix the house for her my grandma was living at my aunts at the time i creaked into one of the back rooms where all my grandmothers things were and i was looking for things from my childhood i thought i would like this is where i found a ring my grandma told me i would have when i was grown up and i took it i also stole my greatgrandmothers ring and a bunch of cameras that day as well she never found out and i am  years old today 
yesterday evening i went to a grocery chain store to purchase some chewable allergy meds once i got home i realized i grabbed the wrong flavor the reason doesnt matter with the meds and receipt in hand i went back to the store to exchange but because it was late in the evening the customer service counter was closed and only self checkout was available i know i should have found someone to do the exchange but i ended up just putting back the one i bought and grabbed the one i wanted and walked out the store i feel like an idiot and am afraid of being branded as a shoplifter

edit no price difference cost exactly the same
when i m was  i really i mean really hated school i would do anything in my power to get a day off fake sick days faking a high temperature fake vomit and so on i got away with this for so many years but people were catching on and getting suspicious

we had a trampoline buried in the ground in our yard and while i was on it one evening i had a thought if i broke a bone then i cant go to school for weeks i was jumping really high thinking how to do it and i rotated my leg so i would land on my ankle and it would hit the metal frame and springs 

i didnt think it was possible to feel that level of pain not just my leg but all through my body 
i landed on the side of my ankle and my whole leg literally cracked i dont know how i didnt do more damage than i did to be honest 

spent the whole night in hospital and to my delight i was put in a full leg cast thigh to ankle and sent home the next evening 

funnily enough it didnt even give me much time from school i had one week of glorious breakfast in bed video games and terrible daytime tv and then i had to use crutches for weeks on end at school with people constantly trying to draw on my cast 

i feel bad about this ive never confessed and i dont think i can now after so many years i dont know why i thought it was a good idea to blatantly hurt myself for this kind of thing im almost worried for myself i was and still might be a little bit psychotic

edit people who are genuinely concerned for my welfare im okay i ended up being homeschooled about a year after this i just had some awful teachers and the school actually ended up being shut down a while after i left i am seeking therapy for nonrelated issues however thankyou for your concerns 
i f was pulling into a parking space at a grocery store a couple months ago and scraped against a sedan next to the spot i was trying to fit into i was in shock because i had just gotten into another accident the day before i promise i am not a reckless driver the one before had been very minor almost invisible damage as i judged the distance behind me while making a three point turn i feel very guilty about leaving the scene of this accident but i would have been in so much trouble if i got into two accidents in two days the other car was empty no one was hurt the damage was probably very minor so ultimately my therapist told me its not a big deal in the grand scheme of things it was wrong however and i acknowledge that i never got caught thank god but i was so scared for weeks just needed to get that off my chest

edit i mistyped i am 

eta im seeing my therapist because i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety major depression adhd and borderline personality disorder at the age of  at the time of this accident i had just started a new stimulant medication at wayyy too high of a dosage the morning before right before the first accident that most likely explains the out of character erratic driving and why i impulsively fled which was objectively stupid i do feel sorry but there is nothing i can do now even if i did confess i have zero idea what the car even looked like couldnt tell you the color just the general size or the exact date i havent had any close calls before those two days or since then im not a victim however i am not a totally shit person who goes out of her way to make everyones days suck the death threats are inappropriate i appreciate the kind words and the people who reprimanded me in a constructive way this was months ago

also i did not leave the scene of the first accident i left a message on their ring doorbell and then went door to door to get someone who had their contact info to call them the owners were very kind and im very lucky for that
 years ago me and a couple friends were walking our neighborhood and we will trespass in unoccupied houses lawns and backyards we didnt break in into any of the houses but and we didnt usually steal anything but one of these times we found a house that look like it was unoccupied we were in front of the house and then one my friend was egging me on to knock on the door to if anyone would answer and then no was there now my friend came up with the idea to steal from the mailbox my friend also said that the person living was possibly dead which made this even more shittier and then we stole the envelopes left from the mailbox and then later look if theres was any money left in any of the envelopes we didnt find any money and then later we either put it back in the mailbox or throw the envelopes away i more leaning that we probably threw it away we got didnt caught but looking back at this i feel guilt and shame i didnt really have any other shitty delinquent behavior i lose contact with these friends and i really regretted being a part of this
i got into a car accident on my rd birthday fortunately i wasnt hurt nor did i hurt anyone but emotionally i am a wreck im from a small town and the child of a single mom up until now my reputation has been unimpeachable the accident was completely my fault i wish it hadnt happened hoped that it was all a dream but it isnt i dont know how to handle this especially with my mom she is so disappointed but for now handling the situation is the best thing to do i genuinely want to not be alive obviously i had to tell my mom but i lied about the details of the accident so far the truth hasnt come out but i think it will and i am not ready for it i have a sinking feeling in my stomach and i dont know what to do 
i sold my first car with a heavy heart for scrap a year ago having not used it for  years i tried to save it but was in such bad condition that it just wasnt worth the effort anymore i have already had bought a myself a better newer one anywayive seen it a couple of times on marketplace just going around between shady people trying to sell a trash car but i havent heard about it for about  months however a day ago it came up in the marketplace of the models fb group it was listed very close to my location

and then something strange happened in my head and did something unexplainable i used my local knowledge and geoguessr skills and identified the exact street i still had one of the spare keys for some reason the buyer did not care at all and as said i was sure its not gonna live longer so i took it and drove there at am completely empty streets turns out the newest owner didnt sell the parts but instead revived it i took it for a  minute ride it felt better than ever parked it and returned home i genuinely think i will contact the seller tomorrow and rebuy it

this is not something that i will ever tell anyone i know as i am normally a  law abiding citizen unlike many other car guys i respect the rules speed limit all the time most people i know would probably freak out understandably i cant even believe myself i did this nonsense

most people here usually make similar confessions about girls and here i am stealing my excar back lmao

tldr found my firstever car on fb marketplace took an old key that i still had and took it for a short ride might aswell rebuy it
i used to stomp on random honey bees outside when i was a little kid and i put worms in water bottles to see what theyd do when i was a kid when i was told that they could live in water for some time 

i got stung by a bee eventually and stopped i was a weirdly obsessed with bugs then taking ants and making ant farms in empty water bottles and etc but they always killed each other and young me was too asinine to find out

i feel bad about it due to bees having a lot of emotional complexity i learned that now
this isnt some big juicy confession just something i did thats funny to me bc i just remembered it and have told no one  

when i was  i was going to this private school and hated it got bullied and all that shit anyway i literally would cry to my mom saying i didnt wanna go and she let me stay home a lot but finally she said i couldnt stay home anymore so one night i decided to fake sick bc she wouldnt just let me not go for no reason apparently faking like i got sick in the toilet and flushed it wasnt believable enough soooo i had the idea to make my own 

 it was about  pm mom and dad were dead asleep i went to the kitchen and remember getting milk salsa different kinds of chips juice and maybe some cheese or something anyway i crushed up the chips mixed it all up in a bowl and put it in the microwave for like  minute 

i proceeded to my bedroom and poured it all on the carpet it didnt smell as bad as actual throw up would but i had to hurry so i put on my fake sick face and voice and went to my moms room told her made her come to my room to see the masterpiece and she just looked at it with no reaction she was genuinely unphased she wasnt comforting me like she usually would she also has a very weak stomach and didnt gag at all just had no emotion she said okay clean this up and go back to bed and walked back to her room i was lowkey disappointed bc thats rly how ur gonna act to my hard work  lmao 

anyway next morning she woke me up for school and i laid in bed until she came back again and said something like do u remember i got sick last night i still dont feel good and she literally just said yea just stay home nothing else no hope you feel better no let me take your temp no youre going to the doctor like usual thinking back on it she  knew it was fake and its lowkey embarrassing maybe she saw the effort and was like ok she rly doesnt wanna go

to this day i have no idea what possessed me to make fake throw up rly unnecessary anyway thats all sorry if it was lame i just never told anyone
when i was  my friend and i were going to the fair my parents gave me  dollars but i knew i would only be able to go on like two rides with that my parents kept a little box filled with  dollar bills in a top drawer in the hallway and the xbox games were right next to it so i got a chair and went up there pretending to look for a game and took the  ate a lot of fair food and went on a lot of rides
i m have been bullied my entire life however i often gaslight myself into thinking i didnt anyhow i use to get jumped alot even infront of my own girl who is now my ex was i was  but ever since i started kickboxing i feel i lost my sanity i get violently angry if i dont hurt another person or see someone in pain it feels like legal torture and its a drug like feeling i cant explain and without it i feel useless like a pen with no ink i need to fight i love the rush of feeling how much power a human can generate and i love seeing people in pain 

it feels so normal and often comforting i love hurting people and ive gone more and more extreme with it i sometimes think how amazing it would be to torture someone the rush would be incredible i feel i will either be in a coma or in the news i often watch hours of gore when ever im angry its soothing and i know how edgey and corny i sound but i needed to get all of this off my chest 

 l
when i was  i began getting headaches and naturally i enjoyed getting to stay home and sit in bed all day but pretty soon the headaches went away so i faked them its pretty easy to fake one just act a little annoyed and disconnected and maybe pretend to throw up this became a habit and now alot of my medical history is a lie my family thinks i have chronic migraines of course even though i have headaches every few months exedrin works just fine now i dont want to fake my headaches so much for work i should be doing but its incessant maybe im just a impulsive liar should i come out to my family about the headaches or try to ease of them
edit it took me a while to be able to face this post i was definitely drunk and was overwhelmed and trying to find an outlet to expel thank you everyone


i started taking care of my mother almost  years ago i was adopted by my step grandmother through my grandfather who had adopted me kiilng himself to trying to help diagnose my deep depression to being not okay with me contacting my birth mother who had stayed in my life as a child as my grandfathers favorite i feel like trash i feel like i didnt do enough through my half sister that felt sickly disconnected and forgotten even though she was well taken care of who crossed my boundaries about my relationship with our mother who hated me for not being more willing to subject her to the pain i had to endure alone being told by my birthmother it was easier to talk to my sister because she didnt have the terrible feelngs of loss about her losing my grandfather my person losing my mother his person losing my sister my biological grandmother being told i was wrong for not reaching out taking care of my unrelated parent who was the only person i had and having to decide to listen to shittalking or being an adult at  to take care of the person that continuously saved my life to losing her and my dog to poor understanding from me about how detrimental it was getting losing my favorite job my soul my mother my worth  and having to keep going alone


i feel so defeated i hadnt called her i a long while because seeing her at the window in my door saying she needed to leave to see her daughter injured me my mommy who helped me even in her diagnoses feel okay after being raped who held me even in her bad days wanted to best the shit out of me because she thought i was a stranger

i feel so lost i feel so beaten and all i want is mommy
i  was  and i was reversing out of a parking lot and i hit my moms car into another car i was with my ex both my moms car and the other car had a huge dent huge almost like a hole there were no other witnesses we panicked we did a hit and run

i tried to get it fixed but it would cost me  bucks i wasnt about to spend  bucks on my moms car 

so we devised a plan i told my mom that her car got hit by another car while i had it parked somewhere and the perpetrator just left and didnt even leave a note this way she wouldnt get mad because it wasnt my fault she seemed to believe the story

i still feel extremely guilty  years later i try to convince myself that the story i made up is really true that it wasnt my fault

to this day my mom still very often jokes about how i crashed her car she never got the car fixed every day we see the dent in her car we laugh and i say it obviously wasnt my fault she literally still jokes about it all the time i know its meant to be a joke but i get the feeling that she actually never really believed my madeup story but i never told her the truth for  years ongoing

i promised myself i would tell her after she got a new car but that might be in like  years because the car was quite new at the time i dont know how long my mom will keep her car 

by that time i will be in my s and if i tell her then i would have been lying to my mom for  years what if she disowns me how could she forgive me for lying to her for that long maybe i should take it to the grave

i dont know whose car we hit i only remember it was a dark grey sedan or maybe dark blue it happened on a small island where everyone knows each other i forgot to write down the number plate i really wish i did i hope they werent that mad about the hole in their car

im a bad person
being the degenerate hedonist i was at  i needed a place to hide my dope and my pills 

my parents were clever it needed to be hidden very well some place they would never think to look 

one day i got to looking at granny up on the shelf just a nice wooden box with an engraving on it 

lightbulbjpg

i pick it up and notice the screws on the bottom i fetch a screwdriver and crack open grannys soontobe notsofinal resting place 

there she was just a big plastic bag full of ashes

she was a mean old bitch alcoholic abusive pathological liar nobody really missed her very few cried at her funeral and i think most were just relieved that the old hag finally keeled over 

i didnt feel bad when i threw her ass in the garbage 

still dont 

every time i visit home i cant help but smile when i see that box on the shelf
from what i can tell it started back in  to  
a couple things lead to this point besides stupidity on law enforcements part firstly i like to lie to people i dont like on facebook when i know someone is on my facebook who likes to gossip especially about me i enjoy feeding them bullshit so i just post insane nonsense its a weird joke nobody is in on but me alot of things ive said over the years would be concerning if you dont know me well or people who arent very smart

second i was big into paintball i played decent roles in large events information being crucial to me in everything i began looking into spy gadgets which i knew would get me put on a list because of that i decided to make it into an unnecessary joke to see how much i can do before i get a fed knocking on my door i began researching basically anything that i knew would be a red flag alot of things lead to a better understanding of things like thermodynamics and such which i think is cool more importantly i enjoy trolling alot to me starting a battle of wits against the best and brightest for the sake of boredom is amusing my main sense of amusement is misleading people in a particular manner where i drop hints that its bullshit i spent a lot of time over the years walking the line in so many ways just so i can reach the point where i am at today 
of particular note law enforcement likes to play very dirty something i should have anticipated but i guess i had to high of an opinion of them than i should have theyve staged several crimes to blame on me which is extremely disturbing to be honest i find it difficult to put into words my disgust towards idaho law enforcement and the awful crimes ive witnessed them conduct 
anywho back to the point because my finely honed debauchery they were under the impression that i was an easy target and are now trying to save face which has been amusing i dont think they have caught onto the fact that i have been messing with them for a long time one day soon i will describe their steps including using women to get close to individuals of interest and with gather information andor instigate they are unaware as of yet that i know this the process is quite interesting but not particularly clever
when i was newly  i  was a serious feminist and also a hard core revenge fan i had a lovely group of girlfriends who decided to take me out to a wildly popular dive bar in the city i was so excited to be invited out with these gals as they were the hardest group of cliques i had ever encountered in my life and i just wanted in well unfortunately the bar was huge and also so packed that evening we were shoulder to shoulder with each other i kept getting my butt stroke pinched and felt up at least xs in the entire  period of time i had arrived i knew it was from the obnoxious ridiculously arrogant group of frat boys standing by our group in fact i slapped one dudes hand off my butt while he was in the midst of another grab since you had to scream yea scream in order to have someone hear you and my so called friends were telling me to relax its no biggie i was furious i wanted to fuck these dicks up and i wanted to start shit so i thought it would be an interesting thing for me to see if i could get them to get their asses kicked by others i knew i wouldnt be able to do it myself so i decided to see if i could get some revenge and have someone else do it for me i consciously made the decision to do this the next hand was the last hand that was going to be touching my ass for that evening so inevitably  minutes into the situation i felt someones hand sliding down the back of my pants i was not even aware of anything other than the rage that i felt about the situation and so i thought hey im gonna really do some thing about it this time and i did i waited about  minutes and then i stepped on the biggest ringleaders foot and gave him a push from behind and it made it look like someone else to push them  then i was like what the hell are you doing motherfucker you cant push people and get away with it and thats when shit got real i will never forgive myself to this day because i have no idea who i hurt but i do know that i caused a lot of bad things to happen that evening the only friend that i am still close with to this day and has no idea that i even began all of this rescued me as the entire scenario went so that shit crazy when we were racing away they were literally  guys in the street and she started screaming they have a gun we were driving away i was completely in denial of the situation i have no idea whether or not anyone got hurt all i know is that because i thought it would be great to get revenge on a situation i let that loud the fact that i got a lot of people hurt i do know that nothing is ever going to make me forgive myself but jesus  its really crazy how violence can get out of hand i i think i went way too hard for this one not even my husband knows would happen if i was to tell my one remaining friend that was able to save me from that evening what i had done she would never talk to me again and that would ruin me so im feeling like i have a huge bunch of karma coming my way and im just waiting it for rent to happen 
i know the title sounds weird but here we are

back then when i was  or  i actually did spend a lot on roblox with my stepsister 

she was  at the time well since i was like  i really didnt think much of spending money on roblox i actually thought it was all free 

xb

i think that my stepmother and my dad went to a dance or something so of course my at the time stepsister had to look out for me at home we decided to play our favourite roblox game adopt me

xb

there was this adopt me hallowen update and my stepsister and i were obsessed

well and since i was  or  i really dont remember much but i do remember the spending 

i think her mom at the time my stepmom connected her card to her phone maybe because she needed something and when my stepsister found out she told me that we can buy robux i agreed because our parents wouldnt let us buy any robux

we bought robux worth alone  euros and we also saved some for our avatars we bought all the adopt me pets that were in the halloween update and we were like the happiest until

xb

probably like  weeks after that they found out and how

xb

i was playing in the morning and i got scammed for my new pet cerberus the dog with  heads i hope you know what i mean well of course i started crying and i went to the living room where my dad was watching the tv he asked me what was wrong and i told him that i didnt want to tell him but i did in the end i said that someone in a game took my ride pet that costs real life money he tried to make me stop crying but the my stepsister and my stepmother came into the living room and she told my dad what happened

xb

of course they were mad who wouldnt be right 

they grounded us for about  months and took our phones also dowloaded us family link and told us were will never play that game again 

and i totally understand because they lost so much money because of us

xb

do u think that i stole it or my sister did maybe both too

xb

ps they are no longer together

but it isnt because of the money that was longer ago
so i moved to europe almost a year ago and was looking for a part time job as i am on work visa here and my actual job was starting in  months
i got a job in a busy kfc store with a reference i worked as boh cook and got settled pretty quickly as everyone there was from pakistanindia
my manager lived in the same building as i did and he often brought me on his car when our timings matched
i had a pixel  at that time and he had a iphone one time on the commute we were getting late and he wanted to log in start shift using his app but couldnt because of some iphone error as he said it so he asked me to download the kfc employee app on android and signin to his account i did and he logged in to start the shift on time lately i forgot about the app and never used it again
 months ago i upgraded to pixel  and while transferring i saw the app and his account was still logged in i explored and found out everyones shift is available there so i did what i had to do i tried to change my previous shift and increased an hour there and to my surprise my next salary slip showed the extra hour and then the next week i added  hours and they appeared on my salary slip so i made it a habit i started adding hours on my shifts in previous week and nobody has ever said me anything the manager has moved to another branch but i am still working here parttime on weekends only but getting paid for  shifts every week

i have started feeling bad about this very recently and will stop from now on i am planning on how to admit this to my manager without getting in trouble as i am on work visa and this could backfire a lot
so between the ages of  i would get as many girls as i could  i was texting them all that i loved them and playing with their emotions long talks on phone and texts sexual with many id go from one to another to another daily id make promises of a future and throw the i love you out there to all all in all it was maybe  different people i was a complete a hole and d bag for doing these things and i seriously regret it all
back in the early to mid s yes last century i had a shopping cart full of stuff from a large retailer lets call them slawmart the store wasnt terribly busy and i bought all the slaw about  in s money went through the checkout and realized id forgotten my checkbook at home the old days lol
the kind hearted cashier suspended the transaction and said i could go home get the checkbook and just come back through the line with the suspended receipt to finish up paying i was like cool so i rolled the bagged cart to the service desk area parked it and told them what had happened and that id be back thru were like cool
when i returned i noticed the store was quite a bit busier rush hour i guess and i went back to service waved my checkbook at them they waved back and i headed to the now very busy cashier but had to go towards the slawgreeter area to get back to where the lines started so with a very long suspended receipt in hand i walked out the door

i got away with it because i was a twentysomething year old white woman in the south decently dressed decent looking and confident with a long receipt in hand thats the goodole usa truth even if i didnt realize it at the time

however my heart didnt stop pounding for several years i still get nervous thinking about it and never did anything like that again
when i was nine i really wanted to a certain item on roblox which would require me to spend a shit load on its currency not that long ago it was my birthday and for my birthday i wanted robux my mom must have accidently saved her card on my tablet because her credit card was like a default option you just needed your tablet password which of course i knew roblox didnt require so social security or phone number or any actual details it just required the card number so i went on a spending spree i bought k robux and bought the item i really wanted

my mom found out she lost  dollars to a game called roadblocks she called it anyways though my mom reported her card got stolen she never got the money back and i kept all of my items me and five of my siblings play the game so they never knew it was me i am fifteen now and still feel guilty to this day but i promise to myself when i get a job i will repay her we barely got by that month generally dont know how we survived and it is completely useless now because i havent played the game in two years
in elementary school there was this teacher that like seemed to hate me for no reason so one day i was like imma give them karma and i took their pen from their desk while they were outside i then snapped it in half and put it in my tables pencil pot for her to discover it later when she found out she said that whoever did it wouldnt be going to lunch so i said that the guy that sits across from me did it and i saw him that lunchtime inside with the teacher giving me dagger eyes 
my mother was in a relationship with a man that lasted up until i was around thirteen years old needless to say it was sometimes emotionally and sometimes physically abusive i was often being cursed out forced beatings that were apparently needed that lasted in  intervals force fed food and being locked in my room only to come out unless i needed to use the bathroom or eat i think the worst was when i was with her boyfriend and he threatened to kill me and him often if i didnt say that my mom wanted to get back with him he even at one point set half the house on fire on purpose lied and said he didnt because he was mad at her she stayed during all of this

sometimes it was okay even good however when she or her boyfriend got mad at me i was punished beyond relief i didnt really build any confidence or likening to myself therefore i just constantly acted out in school which made the punishments worse 

i had a elementary school teacher who for the first time was actually nice to me he would commemorate on everything i did hold me on his lap and talk to me and smile at me i wasnt really getting that positive attention i began to like crave it almost until when i realized the distinction between him and at home i was both angry and upset my mom wasnt giving it to me i basically went home one day and told my mother and her boyfriend what he was doing and when asked if it was inappropriate and in a very subtle way egged by my moms boyfriend to say it was not appropriate they called one of my relatives who essentially worked to get him fired she kind of just told him he couldnt work at the school anymore or something he didnt come back but he became the principal at another school 

i was around  when this happened yes i do know this was a terrible thing i feel horrible about it the only way i feel some relief is knowing that no charges were pressed against him and he had another job almost immediately
throw back to being  at my first job working fast food it was the busiest store in the district with the most sales and i was in charge of the dinner and taking the orders for all the customers wasnt allowed to clean while there were orders to take but i had to be sure that the dinner and bathrooms were clean and the the trash was taken out by the end of the day so one day this group of teens like my age or maybe a bit younger came in kinda sat in the back out of view and proceeded to leave all of their trash on the table despite the trash can being only a few feet away in addition to getting sauses and chili all over the table unfortunately for them one of them left their phone on the table so i did what any good employee would do i cleaned the table throwing everything on it away later the teen that couldnt find his phone came back and asked if id seen a phone i straight faced told him no and we stared at each other for a moment i get the feeling that the gears were turned and maybe hed remembered the mess they left and kinda put  and  together but regardless after that little stare down he just walked out and i never saw him again idk but it felt like justice to me in the moment
yeah as the title says 
when i was about  i heard my mum talking about me needing a hair cut 

during school we had access to scissors in my kid mind i thought i would be saving my mum time by cutting it so i sat in a corner when the teacher was busy and started cutting my hair which was tied back

 child spotted me doing it and sat and watched me told me i shouldnt be doing it etc 

later on when i was at home my mum took the bobblehair tie out of my hair and noticed that my hair had been cut

in panic of my mums reaction i told her it was the boy whose name was a male version of my name  kinda like danieldanielle who had cut my hair eta i blamed the boy who had watched me

the following day my mum reported it to the school his mum got called into school and he got in trouble even more trouble for lying when he denied it his mum had to pay for a hairdresser to fix my hair 

the kicker is i was believed because i was such a rule follower in school i kept my head down and worked telling the teachers if a pupil was misbehaving etc 

this boy was in trouble all through school and he has spent time in and out of prison has had drug issues etc  

i do wonder if that  incident of him telling the truth and not being believed was the start of all his issues 

i heard my mum talking about the above a few years back and i tried to come clean and tell her the truth and she didnt believe me oh the irony


when i was a young boy around the age of  i had a tendency to steal erasers from my friends and teachers in kindergarten and used to bring it home to show my parents and cousins they would ask how i acquired these and i would respond with i took it from kindergarten and they would tell me to give it back and that doing that is bad but my stupid young self did not know the consequences of stealing so then i continued to do it

this habit continued for almost a year until finally people started becoming suspicious and the teachers started searching everyones bag one by one i vividly remembered that moment of panic i had as i didnt know what to do and eventually i tried to hide it in my pockets but then a sudden urge of guilt struck me and seconds later everyone was staring at me then my classroom teacher called in the other teachers into the room and then i started to cry very loudly i then was forgiven by them but i had to promise never to do it again and return them

to this day i still regret and carry that guilt in my head and now that i look back at it i understood it was completely my fault although it was only erasers what are your thoughts
i was about  and working at a fast food restaurant that day it was just myself and my manager working because it was really quiet when i worked sometimes my manager would go into their office and not come out for a while unlsss it was busy and those times i would take orders make them and give them to the customer

it was quiet and usual as in no customers at all when one day this guy comes in and he orders  salt and pepper prawns he was kinda rude to me but i was used to it and ignored it i took his order and went to the kitchen to make his food the prawns used to take  minute  seconds to cook its not long at all but this guy seemed to be huffing and puffing at how long it took while the prawns were in the fryer mind you there was a big window between the counter and kitchen so you could see exactly what was happening if you were a customer

eventually they finish cooking and to save time i used to shake the prawns directly into the box from the fryer basket and of course one fell onto the floor i looked at the customer to see if he noticed but he wasnt paying attention and my manager was nowhere to be seen i didnt wanna have to tell him it would be another  minutes because i could tell he would complain about it and i didnt want to deal with that

so i quickly grabbed a pair of tongs and picked the prawn up from the floor dipped it in the fryer for  seconds or so put it in the box and gave it to the customer he said thank you and left

i could see him through the window happily snacking on his prawns and still feel guilty about it to this day  years later
exactly as the title says a couple of years ago i was heavily into cocaine so my friends and i would stay up all night just talking to each other in my apartment for many nights in a row most people who have done a lot of drugs know that playing video games and watching movies is really not that fun to do while snorting lines all night so we started doing a lot of weird things like this insteadone night for some reason we started messing with this mentally ill guy who we went to school with on facebook who thinks he died when he crashed his car on ecstasy a couple of years back and got a major psychosis from the incident the guy now fully believes he is dead and makes these weird facebook rants telling people he is seeing and talking to angels and demons and that he is dead one night we call up the guy posing as a local newspaper that wants to write an article about him he and my friend had the strangest conversation ever he kept the conversation going for almost two hours while i recorded the whole thing as an mp on my phone

the next day i presented the clip to all of my friends who were totally ecstatic and we all think its the funniest thing we have ever heard we start messing with this guy almost every night after work writing him as god making him record weird songs from heaven and hell making him take weird photos of himself etc but after a week of shenanigans his caretaker or whoever makes him delete his facebook account because the rants online are getting out of control

after realizing that messing with this guy was funny as shit but that we could no longer do it we started looking for new victims first we start trolling our local high schools facebook group posing as this pair of fucked up parents but are eventually found out and kicked then we start trolling the local vegans selling horse meat and other stuff but eventually they make the group private and only members they know personally can join after that we started trolling all sorts of local groups on facebook

to join these local groups you have to have an account that looks somewhat believable so we would go on these religious boards and make posts praising god that shit gets a lot of activity and just start adding people until we had a ton of friends and the account would look somewhat real the people most active on these religious boards are people from places in africa that are very poor and these people are willing to do anything for a couple of bucks so we start calling up random strangers that look like they are willing to do anything for money sending them a bit of cash via westernunion to make them try and do backflips while i record it

the crazy part is that once you send that first dollar they know that there is more where its coming from and you now have your own personal jester overseas and they will do literally anything as long as you send them that first bit of cash

so then it became almost like a new addiction for me i was promising these poor people a big cash prize of course there was no prize if they did what i told them to do on the webcam so i could record it the most fucked up part is that i enjoyed doing it and found it hilarious i used to only do it with friends so we could all laugh at it together but later i often just sat alone callingwriting these poor people and making them do weird and degrading stuff on webcam 
at my first ever job i was working in a drive thru coffee shop as a teenager  and had gotten used to people paying in exact change this guy comes through the drive thru and hands me a wad of coins my brilliant self didnt even count it and threw it into the register thinking he paid in exact change i walked away and the other worker gave him his coffee the customer proceeds to yell through the window asking where his change is pointing at me he makes a pretty big commotion causing my manager to come out and ask what was going on i was so embarrassed i lied and said he gave me exact change my manager backed me and told him to continue along and stop harassing me he ended up driving away

i have no clue how much he gave me i still feel so bad and i can remember his face clearly now that im older and wiser thankfully i know how important even a dollar can be for someone such a stupid thing to do i got fired from that job which was warranted

edited to add im in canada so we have  and  dollar coins it couldve been a lot it couldve been a little i really dont know
i know this doesnt feel like a big deal but i feel really bad even now that im older

when i was in elementary school i was a mean child i never bullied anyone but i was selfish and liked to stir up trouble 

when i was in kindergarten i drew a picture of a bunny i based the drawing off of a little model bunny he was small and realistic the drawing was so good that i made it to a local art collection it only stayed their for a week or so but i was proud of it it was the one time that i got my parents attention anyway the next year in first grade we were drawing animals again i wanted the little bunny again since i did a good job the first time unfortunately a little girl took it before me in an act of pettiness i stole the little bunny so i could keep it i didnt want the little girl to draw a better bunny then me  i felt really bad right after especially when the little girl cried because she thought she lost it but at least she didnt draw a better bunny than me 

i also once stole a book from my second grade class i know how mischievous  it was a book about prehistoric animals and i really liked it instead of asking my parents to buy it i stole it i coved the teachers name with stickers so nobody could tell 

my and one of my friends also stole a piece of toast from breakfast every day our cafeteria had these really good pieces of toast in the morning but they always had a take one sign we didnt like that we found a way to position the toast under another piece we took two every day and never got caught 

i stole a calculator from one of my other friends i asked to borrow it on the last day of school and forgot to give it back to her i actually forgot i dont think she remembers i took it

i stole a lot of other smaller things like legos from the lego club i joined but im not going to list them all
after i graduated elementary school i never stole anything from someone else again besides cookies from the pantry and stuff from my sister lol ive never told anyone else about all this stuff and its kinda nice to get it off my back i still remember all this which goes to show that you never really forget it even years later i still feel bad for these little things even though they were small
when i was  a girl sent me a nude and i screenshotted it she also showed me her breast on a video call and i tried to record it without her consent i regret it heavily now and i deleted them both immediately after i thought it was ok because people would always talk about taking screenshots secretly and that it was a common thing i didnt do it to blackmail her i did it because i thought it was hot
i used to lie for fun as a child partly because of a lack of attention from my parents but mainly because i just enjoyed it it started with little ones such as my favorite color having certain petssiblings etc then one day it escalated to me lying about having certain illnesses and disorders i didnt have any bad intentions it was just a hobby to me and fun to see how far i could go with peoples trust 
however what i didnt expect was for the few kids i told about having cancer to to then tell their parents and then the staff they wanted to start a fundraiser for me they wanted to start hanging up posters in the hallways with my school picture on it and a short paragraph saying i was suffering from ovarian cancer all within one week i was absolutely mortified this went on for a few more days until my mom was phoned by another parentfriend expressing their sympathy for her childs illness i remember that day vividly i was in the kitchen and she was in the basement i heard her pick up the phone then shortly yell my name i walked over to the steps and she asked if i told people i had cancer and i panicked my mind at that point was so trained at making up lies i immediately told her that there was another girl with the same name that had cancer in my grade and that we must have gotten confused i heard her explain this to the mother on the phone and sighed of relief when she said that poor girl in reference to this other girl with my name that had cancer 
the next day i went into school and was confronted by the guidance counselor who asked to speak with me long story short the other girls mom was notified by a close friend and it all came circling back to me she explained the boy who cried wolf and how lying can really hurt people i came up with stupid excuses as a child does but what i would never expect is being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in college seems like too much of a coincidence to me i believe its karma so does my mom shortly after that i was also diagnosed with a brain tumor which seems like a cherry on top of the already deserved parfait of payback 
anyways ive since mended my ways and am in remission i still talk to the other girl every once in a whilewe created a weird sort of friendship after everything died down
i work as a technician at an automated storehouse and im hired in a company that delivered the automated facility the company that owns the warehouse is a different company but we work closely together we do maintenance on the machinery and ensure that everything is running  while the company that owns the facility hire people to drive forklifts pick products refill machines etc

products are loaded on to conveyors and are sent in to the warehouse the people doing this job are supposed to ensure that the pallets and products fit the criteria like removing straps plastics checking dimentions and stability of the boxesproducts on the pallets etc when the pallets coming in are crooked they often fall over easily most of the time its the forklift drivers fault which annoy me and my colleagues a lot its now we the technicians job to get the machines up and going again one time i fixed up a pallet and of pure anger i kicked the hell out of it and ruined products sent the pallet to the station for broken pallets knowing some dude there has to fix it 

other times i have pulled out completely fine products that have fallen on the ground inside a machine and again i kicked the product in to the wall it was a packet full of rice now there was rice everywhere and it fell through the holes in the floor down to the machinery below i just left it

its not rare that products are damaged in the facility so none of this is ever questioned and i havent done this many times at all but i still did it
i dont know where my anger comes from or if its just pure boredom i also sometimes get the urge to just throw stuff but i resist it every time i dont know why i feel this way but i know i shouldnt be doing it i just felt like i needed to get this off my chest
my parents were always big on the whole teaching them how to work before they have to actually have a job so i started cleaning for this older woman and her husband when i was probably about  my mom knew the womanwas friends with her and they lived right down the road from us maybe  mile probably lessi could walk there in less than  minutes anyhow she has this beautiful super old victorian house and shes just too old to keep up with all of the cleaning so she hired me for like  a week or something to come once a week and she gave me a list of things that i could clean in a few hours more times than not i would finish cleaning and end up just sitting there talking to her or listening to her tell stories or give life advice she was awesome and adorably funny 

i got completely side tracked point of the story is her husband smoked camels and i was a curious little gremlin about smoking and whatnot and a couple of times i took a cigarette out of his pack that he kept on top of their china cabinet in the kitchen and would smuggle it back the couple minute walk home and would climb out onto the porch roof outside my bedroom window at night and would try to smoke while everyone was asleep thats how i tried my first cigarette and it was terrible and i hated it and im still amazed how i never had gotten caught by neither the old lady or my parents
once when i was  i was late to go outside for recess i believe i was in the bathroom if i recall correctly  
  
usually my best friend whom im now married to and i were practically attached at the hip at recess but because i was late to go outside and she was ushered out with the rest of our class she was outside playing already  
  
when i went outside she was sitting with her back to the door of the school in a pile of leaves and another boy in our class was sitting very close to her  
  
in a somewhat concerning display of jealousy i picked up a rock and pelted it right at the back of his head he didnt know whod thrown it and he ended up telling the teacher no one else saw me throw it and i never spoke up either
it was fourth grade we were going on a field trip to the movie theatres i asked my mom for some money that morning and she handed me a crisp  my ungrateful fat ass decided that wasnt enough  to get popcorn and candy so i devised a plan 

every friday in june my school sold popsicles out front of the office this was to help fund school trips and stuff like that i swiftly volunteered to selflessly s give up my recess to sell popsicles 

every few customers i would slip a loonie up my hoodie sleeve soon enough i had a rattling sleeve of coins i excused myself and dumped it into my backpack 

 hours later i was at the movies with my classmates munching on  worth of my favourite candies and of course the popcorn i was originally supposed to buy 

nobody ever found out as far as i know i never got in trouble i have felt guilty about it ever since decades later
one time had to spend some time on the phones in a customer service role for a credit card company  customer was upset because she was supposed to get  days same as cash on her sony tv purchase  but she was late on that deal by  days

i thought she sounded cute and it didnt impact my company if sony lost some interest revenue   so i offloaded her statement data and altered the payment date to make it look like the payment satisfied the conditions of her purchase and sent her a copy of the altered statement  

xb
as a young kid i was excessively walking on eggshells and it constantly felt like everything was my fault because of this when im confronted with a problem i tend to act inauthentic towards it its easy to pretend rather than deal with possibly being yelled at to get this negativity out i will talk bad about the person behind their back as it helps me keep my emotions in balance without feeling like its my fault i get loads of validation of people being like yeah i hate this person too or yes they are such a weirdo and i instantly feel joy however i dont realize the destruction of this mean girl behavior before you know it im the regina george and the entire place is going nuts i wish i could change

edit i went to therapy a year ago and it did not help my therapist was very backhanded any other suggestions would be great without being snooty or rude

edit  to those who asked i prefer the validation over the gossip if you wanna call it that i am by no means saying my behavior is warranted either  im also not okay with being referred to as girl or boy i shouldve said this earlier though

edit  and  i wasnt sure about admitting this happening to me cuz it happened just a few days after my second edit but im sure you guys would love to know i got punched but it was coming and im not good with physical altercations hence why i talked behind peoples back you guys warned me i will say that i learned a valuable lesson and thats never to talk behind someones back

what goes around comes around and i know that now
back in college i had a stable part time job for quite a while and hence i had a pretty decent credit score for a college student  i was driving a nice luxury car but it was just a used car bought with a car loanit was a somewhat irresponsible car loan but not outrageous  i also had several gold credit cards that lined my wallet because my credit score was good enough that banks would issue me gold cards  so once in a while some friends would be amazed that i had multiple gold credit cards when i took out my wallet to pay for something   
  
the reality is that my part time job even though very stable only pays enough for me to get by but certainly not to live a luxurious student life  i had a girlfriend who was somewhat materialistic  and up to this date i still believe that one reason that she was with me was because she thought i was rich enoughor my family was rich  
  
anyway when we moved in together to a higher end apartment she thought we were living a good liferelative to most other students  the secret was that she didnt know my salary from my part time job was impossible to sustain in the long run the higher rents as well as all the entertainment expenses that she wanted to have    
  
once every  or  months i would end up short on money  in the hindsight i was smart enough not to load up on my credit cards even when i was trying to keep up with the false image that i created for myself  so what did i do when i was short on cash and i didnt use my credit cards  this is where my confession and regret are  
  
my then livein gfs family is actually quite well off  and they always kept her bank account with a fairly high cash balance  most times she didnt even have an exact idea of how much cash she has in her bank account  since she thought that i was rich she trusted me with her bank account  once in a while when she was too lazy to make a bank run shed ask me to withdraw some spending cash for herself from her own bank account by giving me her atm card and the pin i always made the withdraw for her and i would give her the cash and the printed receipt so that she could see that i withdrew exactly what she asked    
  
during the month that i knew i was about to be short for rents or car payments id find good opportunities such as when she was taking a long afternoon nap or she slept in on a weekend morning from partying the night before i took her atm card from her purse and went to withdraw a few hundred dollars from her bank account  
  
at that time i justified it by telling myself that she didnt pay rents or food when we lived together still deep down inside me i knew i was stealing from her period i stole from her bank account on the average about once every  to  months during the  years that we lived together  i was smart enough or calculating enough not to be too greedy and i always only took what was necessary at the time never more than necessary  and that practice kept the stolen amount low with respect to her bank account balance and that was the key of never drawing any suspicion from her  
  
after i graduated and got a pretty good paying job i no longer needed to steal money from her bank account  the irony was that she eventually still left me to be with a much older guy a financially well off guy
took an oreo split it in half used the half with the cream to clean up pee drops from a toilet bowl from the boys bathroom closed the oreo and gave it to this classmate who ate it
it was  of us i didnt give the biscuits to her but i was the one who soaked the cream in pee
ive been regretting it since
saw a spider in my kitchen sink thought about taking it out to the nearest window but had no way to trap it and had to think fast because it was trying to climb out the sink and wouldve lost track of it

i also thought about whacking it against the sink to give it a quick death but then figured i didnt want its blood on my hands nor in the sink i wash my plates in

so i turned the tap on and drowned it i made the water lukewarm so it didnt suffer more than it needed to i dont know how quickly it died because i ran it for a good  seconds or so cant imagine how painful that mustve been
i was sitting at a table during class with three other people who are complete strangers
i had a gum wrapper and two batteries i set the batteries side by side on the foil side of the gum wrapper i didnt think it would spontaneously combust in like a second i swatted the wrapper onto the floor and stepped on it not long after the teacher walked over to the front of the class and said that it smelt burnt up there the three other people i sat with played it off that it was the welding class but some random kid said it was first period so we played it off like it was our  bags after the teacher walked back to their desk i picked up the burnt remains of the gum wrapper and left class and nobody suspected me at all
okay in  or  me my friend and my siblings would always go to a place we called the dirt hill and we would do random things there like dig  foot deep holes and make stuff out of scrap wood 

one day when we got there my sister had an idea to start a bon fire so we did just that we gathered some rocks and put them around in a circle we got some wood and then we where ready to start the fire me and my brother got the matches and then we started the fire keep  in mind this dirt hill was in a feild with a lot of weeds

 everything was going well we were getting more wood for the fire to burn longer but when we went to get some more wood and we came back and the fire somehow got out of the circle and started spreading quick

 we where all trying to stop the fire i was throwing sand on the fire but it was not working then my brother had the bright idea to put a haybale on the fire to stop it so he did it then the fire stopped but then quickly came back but now the fire was like x bigger half of the field was on fire 

we went to our neighbors house and asked them to call  and to use her hose to try to stop the fire but it did not work the fire was just getting bigger and bigger finaly after a litteral minute of waiting the fire trucks where there and they took out the fire 

we were all scared about what our parents would think they where mad at us for a few months the field was black and burnt so yeah dont play with fire
it was a diary but id only used the first few pages before i lost it i was so angry at my step dad i wrote all the horrible things he did and wrote a help note in there with my mums number my address and full name i wrote how i wished someone could just come rescue me and get me away from this house and how hes a danger to society not literally but it definitely came across that way i was maybe  when i did this 

i dont know why i did this so embarrassing thankfully nothing ever came of it but i do wonder where that is because all the information in that note book is still the same 
im the youngest of  siblings all girls we were having a sleepover at my cousins who is about my middle sisters age it was all going good until i had to use the toilet it was approaching night time and we were getting ready for bed when i went to use the toilet so i was doing my business keep in mind i was about  years old when i saw some cigarettes on the floor i didnt know what it was but i saw something that said toxic on it so my natural defence i was like oh let me hide it cause its bad so i put it into this pot in the bathroom and left few minutes after my aunt walked in to the bathroom for a smoke but she couldnt find her cigarettes and she yelled and shouted accusing everyone i stayed silent i was scared so i was like let me go in the bathroom and put them back where they were so i did she checked the bathroom again and found her cigarettes and she was like hold on who took them she ultimately ended up accusing my older sister of it and its a secret ill take to my grave

edited forgot to add on she lowkey still despises my older sister and blames her for it
event occurred in  being  and dumb it seemed like the right thing to do at the time my coworker was with me and he was doing donuts in their forklift which surprisingly had the keys left in the ignition we worked at a fast food chain next to a movie theater that was closed for renovation but we had access to where they were working
not openly but to friends i was around  at the time and when my friends sometimes got into a serious convo and shared their private lifeissues i felt like i had nothing of value to share back and i could therefore lie about the most disgusting things that had happen to me simply just for attention

then i unexpectedly found myself in a situation at  when something actually had happened to me and i didnt dare to tell anyone because i felt like no one was going to believe me 

none of my old friends ever got to know that it was all lies neither did i ever tell anyone what happened


edit i obviously regret lying about these things thought that was made clear and i never mentioned any names or accused anyone with these lies but wishing death on me for something  year old me did is not going to change anything
i did it because some people didnt know how to type without looking at the keyboard
my friend lets call him x let me borrow his full csgo loadout it was a dragon lore factory new karambit doppler ruby ma howl minimal wear ak wild lotus field tested pandoras box gloves minimal wear and more he sent over a hundred thousand dollars his entire inventory to me to borrow 

at this point x had been my friend for  years i initially met him on omegle and we added each other on discord before my birthday i told x how his skins are my favorite in the entire game i was lying i only liked their price point 

x to my surprise then let me borrow his skins for my birthday he told me to give the skins back after the  week trade cooldown 

i didnt 

he kept messaging me repeatedly and spamming me with calls after i ghosted him for over a week eventually he begged me for the items back over and over again it was especially painful to me because he didnt even sound mad just really sad and desperate i blocked him a couple months ago because i couldnt bear the thought of the messages and the guilt has followed me since
sometimes the teacher used to call me over to this one table where she would talk to students and also she would read with us and some other things at the table one day she was reading and i saw a cool pencil so i secretly got the pencil and started writing with it to make it seem like it was mine when she was done yappin i walked off with the pencil like nothing another time i saw an eraser that erased really good so i took that as well and i dont regret it for a millisecond
in the deep days of my addiction i did a lot of scamming that included over exaggerating my abusive relationship i got out of posted what he did pretended to be in the hospital and my family posted it to raise money i also owe many people from my graduated hs class for emergencies that i made up 

i saw a second cousin for the first time in many years at a family wedding and asked for car bill money and spent the  on drugs 

i took advantage of a older man who hit on me while i did pest treatment at his house bc i told him i would tell his wife that was there when he did it if he didnt pay me 

a coworker from the same job was a guy who was my dads age and took me under his wing i came up with a story and he gave me  he didnt have 

i regret everything i did to get money for drugs that wasnt even the start of it i know im basically unable to go to any high school reunions now bc of how bad it was and how many people i screwed over
i wasnt really good at studies back then but i always completed my notes in school and my handwriting was pretty good as well

on the other hand my best friend who was always seated next to me was a good student always got good marks but she didnt complete her notes in class shed either write very slowly or fiddle around with something when i asked her about it shed say that shell ask a book from someone and complete it later

even though i rarely studied at home or did my homework when i was packing my bag some of the books were missing but when i went to school the book was there in my bag to write the notes this was a frequent thing but i think i was too stupid to notice until later and found out what was actually happening

so one day my bestie was tilting her chair backwards as she normally would and i looked back to find out that she was slowly either taking or leaving my biology writing book in my bag she was caught redhanded

so i confronted her and asked her if she had been stealing my books and taking them home apparently she had been taking them to complete her notes when i told her that she shouldnt have done that because i need my books to study and do my homework she said something along the lines of its not like you use your books to study anyway

i was so angry yes i dont study or do my homework but thats none of her business and she surely shouldnt be doing what she was doing she could have just asked if she wanted my books

so on a fine day i stole her biology writing book which was almost over and filled with beautifully written and completed notes im pretty sure that she knew it was me

my initial intention with the book was to keep it in her school bag after a week first she confronted me but i denied ever taking her book then she started cursing the person who took her book with me and one day during that week she looked into my eyes and said that she worked hard on completing her book and the person who took her book must be cursed and struck by lightning

since i was cursed anyway at that i went home and waited for the moment that everyone at home lost their interest in me and burned her biology writing book

the relief the guilt the courage the satisfaction all came rushing in at once but there was one thing i couldnt do for sure i could never return her book to her

this was a while before our ordinary level examination and she never found her book so she had to write and complete the whole book again to which she said that she was grateful to the person who took her book because she was able to study again while writing the notes while this might have been true she probably said that to make me feel guilty to be honest i did feel guilty for burning her book at times but i kind of didnt care much either because i felt like i didnt do anything wrong and she deserved it

fyi this happened at a time when i was very innocent and didnt even think of stealing anything from anyone

edit this was  years ago and i was  back then and quite immature at this point in my life i find it funny that i burned a book because someone cursed me
my parents left each other after they had me and were never married when i was five my mother moved to florida and i would go down to see her during the summer when i was  my grandfather gave me a bracelet that had belonged to his mother her mother and so on the bracelet was gold with a heart in the middle one summer while i was with my mother we had gone to a fancy restaurant and i wore the bracelet while we were eating i took the bracelet off because it was hurting my wrist and i didnt want to get food on it i guess at one point i mustve knocked the bracelet off the table because when we left i noticed that i didnt have the bracelet and looking back when we were leaving the bracelet was not there i never had the guts to say anything about it because my mother was strict and i didnt want to waste gas money to this day nobody noticed that the bracelet has disappeared i recently got my aunts old engagement ring that had belonged to my uncles great aunt im scared that i might loose this family heirloom too
hey everyone

im writing this post because i dont know what else to do that would not involve blowing up my whole life

background i live in an east coast welltodo city and work in a fastpaced industry i am married and in my midthirties with a preteen daughter

for the last six years i have been highly miserable stressed and unhappy instead of dealing with my issues like an average person i started smoking a lot of cannabis to relieve my anxiety i have been smoking since the age of  so cannabis didnt make me feel like i was partaking in anything severe or harmful what first began as a joint once every few days quickly turned into  joints a day every day minus the traveling and even then depending on where i went i would smoke 

fast forward to  i switched careers and a successful friend pressured me into traveling to colombia i got the goahead and made the trip it was mostly uneventful except it was the first time i tried cocaine im not a massive fan of the experience but it was memorable i felt like i walked away with some experience but ultimately it was not for me or so i thought i spent eight months not touching cocaine and then a family issue triggered me one night out i asked another friend dont worry they test for some cocaine because i didnt want to sleep or go home 

fast forward again i began buying a gram here and there from the connections i made and the weird thing about it is that it makes me feel calm not hyper which has the opposite effect on most people i worry that i will beginor have begun using regularly because i noticed a considerable increase in my job performance since my brain can focus on tasks when under cocaine i feel ashamed because i dont think this is an healthy way to manage whatever is causing my brain to behave this way

one set of friends enjoys drugs and the other set of friends and family are incredibly antidrug and would not be supportive i have not been running around or doing anything stereotypical that one might be getting intono latenight escapades or binges or anything like that its just me secretly blowing through a gram during daylight hours too within  hours of purchase then i beat myself up for about a week and do it again 

this has been my reality for the last  days or so my wife would not handle this news well and it would hurt her a lot so i also feel like a piece of shit
grew up poor and liked things it started small with make up and earrings every once in awhile and then it became a regular thing that i no longer felt nervous when i stole then i started stealing money from my parents and things from my sister when i get jealous got caught i even stole from a classmate and got caught if not stealing i would change the price tags of items or add more items into the product 

life was hard then so i just stole nonessential items to cope with everything else i was lacking

stopped stealing once i made my own money i did what i could in the situation i was in even if it was morally unsound i just feel bad for what i did
ok so i dont usually make posts here or on reddit in general but i feel like i need to tell someone about my problem so im  and ive been drinking since about julyaugustish and hiding it from my family and i feel bad about it but at the same time i cant stop i stopped for a bit in september for school n stuff but continued a few weeks later my friends say i have a problem and that i need to stop but it just makes me feel so good and it makes my depression feel numb then one of my friends who was telling me to stop stopped telling me to stop after i got them tipsy at a sleepover and now i feel bad about giving them it i really hope im not a bad person for doing that and alcohol isnt the only thing ive done ive also smoked weed and ive considered cigarettes or harder drugs like shrooms but im scared ill have an addiction or something and die at  lol

edit 
i am in therapy for different issues and ive been trying to work up the courage to tell my therapist but its kinda scary cause ik hell tell my parents and they will freak if they find out
another thing that i thought was important is that alcoholism runs in my family so yeahhh 

edit 
i saw a comment or two talking about just picking up the bottle one day but i wanted to say that it wasnt just me really it was my friend who influenced me a bitshe had drank a bit too at the time and started doing it but she has since stopped all drinking habits and is telling me to stop too

edit  so i kinda forgot about this post but i wanted to give a bit of an update soo i accidentally got two of my friends into drinking and j feel bad about it i want to stop but it just feels so good being drunk i did some bad things with my friend last time i got drunkwhich was last saturdaysunday  its currently thursday and i feel horrible just thinking about it  i pretended that i didnt remember it but i remember all of it i feel even worse since they have a boyfriend and i dont want him to find out what we did one more thing is that ive seen some people just guessing my pronounsgender i just want to say i dont really want to say my bio gender or gender identity on here just to avoid anything bad so you can just use they pronouns or anything else idrc that much about that stuff but thank you every one who gave advice im trying to inter grate it into my life slowly but its kinda hard lol this might be my last update for awhile but i might update if any big news happens 
my parents keep old alcohol in the refrigerator for yrs and refuse to throw any of it away one night in the summer i decided i was going to drink to numb the pain i drank once and loved it drank a second time and threw up everywhere and swore i would never drink again but i kept doing it at least  times after that and refilled the bottles with water i tasted it the alcohol still tastes really strong to me i hope no one notices and this honestly keeps me up at night so yet another thing to worry about caused by me my parents dont drink thankfully yet they dont want to get rid of the alcohol 

i even went so far as to redying the alcohol back green with food coloring because it was so diluted 

i bought gummies from this one store and ive never been so happy and so scared from it at the same time i loved that all my problems seemed like they were in the past when i took them but they started making my chest hurt so i got rid of them 

i have a problem and honestly im a bit suicidal but i dont know what to do im  so obviously still underage to drink alcohol if my parents find out im actually dead theyd never let me leave the house again and that terrifies me because being in the house is a huge reason why im so fuckimg depressed i wanna die but i dont wannna die at the same time its so hard honestly i feel like no one understands me and i have no one to talk to even my therapist i havent truly opened up to her yet because im so scared she will judge me even though i know she wouldnt god please help me

edit and to the weirdo harassing me on all my posts go to hell
i was driving around running errands one day and miss judged where a curb was when i was making a hard right and hit a sharp corner the tire didnt pop but the rim got very bent causing the tire to lose air pressure to the point we had to add air to it weekly 
its been over  years we no longer have that van and im still scared to tell my dad i did it and im a grown ass adult with an adult child of my own
also when the machine asks me how many bags i took i say  even though i took bags
my moms f the type of person to keep everything and i mean everything from old clothes that havent fit in decades to empty candle containers she swears shell reuse but never will to actual garbage shell one day find a use for shes not a hoarder but shes certainly disorganized i think this tendency to attach sentimental value to things has a lot to do with abuse and neglect she suffered in her childhood 

whatever the cause most of it ends up in the garage 

my moms dreamt of having the garage as a functional social space a place to keep the car warm in the winter and a place i f can play my musical instruments and my sister f can hang out in in the summer though my mom likes to keep things she doesnt like to be the one to find them places that job usually lands on myself or my younger sister thus the job of making space in the garage fell to me i didnt mind after i moved out my mom let me keep a lot of my stuff in there anyway so some of it was mine 

with the goal of making space in mind i knew i was going to have to go through and get rid of a lot of the random garbage my mom keeps around and i couldnt feel bad about it if i wanted it to be done in an afternoon or two i dont know its like i turned off my empathy or something i reasoned that the things in the garage couldnt be that special or shed have at least looked at them once in the last three years 

i came across a box hidden deep in the pile of random shit containing a bunch of mine and my sisters old childhood things pictures art wed made report cards from school baby blankets baby clothes the works itd been in that box for years moving with us from place to place stuff i hadnt seen since i was ten stuff i hadnt realized shed kept 

the thing about my mom is that she loves her kids more than anything more than herself were her biggest source of pride says were the only two things she ever did right in life every single one of those objects and documents are symbolic of that especially the report cards she loved to hear the positive reviews from teachers wed bring home those were the only affirmations she ever got about raising us right otherwise she was on her own 

i threw half of it out dropped it off at the dump myself 

im not a total monster i kept the photos and a few of the art pieces some of the clothes most of what i threw out had gotten damaged or even a little moldy but there are definitely things that couldve been salvaged i came up with the idea after i did this to combine the box into a scrap book and functional quilt i threw out so much that neither of those things are possible anymore 

the worst part is i never gave my sister the opportunity for input i never even told her about it she doesnt have a lot from her early childhood we were especially poor after she came along i realize now that this box has been packed up since before she was  she never got to see the report cards the art the baby blanket none of it 

i knew it was wrong as i was doing it i destroyed these ties to our childhood because i wanted to get out of the garage faster thats all 

i dont think i can ever face it either the guilt of it sits like a constant weight on my chest every time i see either of them but when my mom asks about the report cards im probably going to lie about it shes held a grudge against my aunt who did a similar thing to her for years and i cant face the consequence of my actions even if its what i deserve






edit theres been a lot of feedback on this post and i just want to add some more details to help with some clarity things 

the first being that i did not go into the garage and start randomly throwing her things away she specifically asked me to clean it for her she knew i was throwing a lot of things out i also sent some things to donation but most of it was too damaged a lot of those things were mine too i took two truckloads of things out of the garage and its still pretty full just more organized i also put things off the floor to prevent further damage i didnt clear out enough things to make the space my mom dreams of unfortunately theres just too much stuff 

second that most of what i threw out was rotten water damaged halfeaten by mice old food various garbages i even found a couple bags of old household trash the sentimental box was one of the more salvageable ones 

third the things i threw out i didnt throw out to create more space though that was my ultimate goal in the garage in the first place after all there is still a box of the remainder i threw it out because it was damaged by water or this weird yellow liquid even a little moldy its just that i feel i shouldve put more effort into finding ways to salvage what i did get rid of it doesnt matter how damaged it was my mom would be devastated she wouldve worked harder to save it its for this reason that i wish i wouldve done the same i dont think it couldve stayed in that box like that much longer but i couldve been more creative in my solution i shouldve prioritized that because its important to my mom 

fourth my sister did not want to be in the garage with me that day i was not actively preventing her from being in there shes very embarrassed to be seen in there with the mess when the door is open to the neighbourhood i should definitely have gotten her attention to show it all to her before i threw anything out and i feel horrible she never got the opportunity because of me

thank you all for your input 
this is gonna sound so stupid and insignificant but when i was  when small little hometown grocery stores and gas stations were all we had around i used to steal the penniesdimesquarters from the little donation bowls at the counter usually for donations toward the military and when i think about it now i thought i was so sneaky but everyone probably knew exactly what i was doing bad thing is i have no idea what i would do with the money after because i was probably too young to have a piggy bank penny bank and for my parents not to notice i had more money than i had been given it really wasnt much money overall probably it probably amounted to  at most over the whole time i was doing it i dont know why i did it either or how i even learned that behavior i guess maybe i had learned somewhat what money was because i used to watch my parents count cents and place them into rolls so maybe i just thought that money no matter where i was getting it from was a good thing either way i regret that i was a little thief at the age of 
when i was  the girl that lived next to the church i attended picked me up from sunday night service i wasnt required to be there i went to church on my own i just got rides from family so that her and i could go on a joyride in her moms new car my idea the girl was  and the day before this i walked in on her and my younger brother having sex the cost of keeping the secret i wanted to drive her moms new convertible we live in a very rural area so i drove us into the city and took us directly into the hood i thought i was everything in the new car top down just a teenager until we got side swiped and it put a very long and deep scratch down the drivers side of the car so we left and went to my house where i put a bunch of dirt and rubbed it like a dirty truck had hit her  days later she called me her mom noticed her scratched car as she was leaving work and thought someone did it while she was at work every time i drive by that house i think of that girl and our joyride
this post is not fake nor it is a ragebait if youre going to insult me i will ask you to at least read the whole thing

im really disgusted of my self i cant believe that i did what i did when i was  i was in a public swimming pool with some family one of them was my cousin she was  writing this feels disgusting at one point she was tired and ask for help to get to the ground when i picked her up and while getting her to the edge i rubbed her she giggled and said it tickled this is it and i cant get it out of my head what lead me to this  at that time i just moved from a third world country to america i came from a country where women are not respected i grew there with friends and family always talking about women like trash and sexually reducing them i believe my development was fucked this was not healthy for  a child ans i shouldnt even had that perverted mine at that age at that time i just thought its hot to do what i did and didnt see the problem with it now i grew and i forged my morals i became respectful and realised how flawed my world views were i try to educate men about feminism and i hate guys who think how i used to think as adults today i just pray to every living god that she either dont remember this incident or just thinks i was tickeling her not for my sake but for her own i dont to be the one who caused sa trauma and i want her to be healthy i dont know what to do if i should even talk about it with her or continue to hope its gone from her mind am i an saer for life or by changing i can say that its not me that did it  im consumed with guilt and hope shes okay 

edit  thanks to everyone for all the advice and for sharing your experiences some people are confused because i didnt want to go into details since were talking about childs when i say rubbing it was my hand on her private part and through the clothes it was like a second and yes sadly it was intentional i tried responding but my comments are getting auto deleted for some reason you can read some of them by going to my profile directly tho i wont bring the subject to her since you advised me not to and i will try to navigate my remorses i can tell you a story that i lived when i was  to maybe give you more insight in what kind of environment i grew in i was invited by a  years old boy to an empty classroom after class to watch him masturbate in front of me i watched the whole thing and wasnt even chocked i had a flawed and naive view i couldnt explain it i used to be groped by boys because i looked feminine because i had blue eyes and it was rare in my country  anyway i think all this led me to be totally fucked in the head writing this it feels like its surreal but i have to live with this sadly have a great day and i hope you never hurt somebody like i did

edit   no i never posted this anywhere in the internet nor did i ever spoke about it to anyone this is the very first time i also still cant reply in the comments for some reason i wouldve liked talking to some of you but its not possible sadly i read every response thank you all
inspired by todays meirl post when customers would pay for the people behind them in the drive thru line i would continue the chain till a customer was paying in cash at that point i would break the chain pocket the cash and have the next customer pay for theirs not knowing about the chain
last night my son took a bite of an apple and his tooth fell out it was right before bed and after searching the house in my pajamas i  realized we didnt have any cash laying around the house except in his piggy bank so i took a few dollars of my sons own money and placed it under his pilllow of course ill replace it at some point 

i basically robbed peter to pay peter
this used to eat away at me but its been long enough that ive managed to get lucky and landed some jobs that it hopefully wont matter much anymore 

i was supposed to graduate college in the s and i attended my state college for  years i was in a major i wasnt passionate about and was definitely dealing with some undiagnosed depression i didnt didnt bring it up at the time and chalked it up to being a lazy piece of shit etc etc i basically failed all my courses for the last two years and my asian parents had no idea they thought i was doing fine and i would graduate on time because they would never ask to see my grades and just trusted i would tell them if something was up i had no idea how the fuck i would swing it at graduation and i would have to tell them that i had been failing for the past two years come time for graduation my parents wouldnt be around one was out of country the other had a business trip so i conveniently told them that i didnt care about graduation so they wouldnt have to come or feel guilty about missing it when in actuality i handed my the dropout form to the school 

all this time ive felt awful for lying to my friends and family mostly to my parents who paid tens of thousands of dollars so that i could get a degree and not have to worry about paying off any debt to keep up the facade i had to pay some shady online service for a fake replica degree from my university in hopes that they wouldnt notice it took me a year to find a job after graduating but i somehow luckily bullshitted my way into a position in my major field i completely lied about having a degree on the job and the background check didnt come back with any issues so i got insanely lucky 

to this day not a single person knows i didnt graduate my friends including the friends that attended the same university my family my significant other etc i honestly dont really have plans to tell anyone but maybe one day ill feel comfortable enough
what i did is inexcusable when i took the photo i was walking by with my phone at my side and i took the photo but the flash was on she almost definitely noticed because she has been avoiding me

i feel terrible i cant imagine how bad it must feel being harassed while standing around shes probably gonna develop trust issues because of what i did

i felt that i should apologize to her but what would i even say sorry for taking a pic of you 

i feel like the best thing i can do is to avoid interacting with her so she can forget i existed

ive been feeling so guilty because theres nothing i can do to improve the situation besides not talking to her and i wish she would confront about this so i can tell her im sorry
i was convicted of drunk driving in the uk i blew a  it enabled me to act shocked as they thought i was going to blow under but i knew i knew i would blow over but i was shocked at how low it was i had been playing with fire for a long time i was half a bottle vodka in doing mph down a motorway before i want to tell people the truth that it was bad before i go caught ive learnt so much since then but i know they would not forgive me i went through a massive rough patch after and lost a hell of a lot of people because they cant reconcile a drunk driver being guilty and trying to sort themselves out i heard a lot of it was your own fault yes it was  but im trying to fix myself but i feel i cant move on without telling people the truth but its been long enough that i would lose family and what little friends i have left somedays i think that i would have been better off dying when i crashed

this happened like  months ago i was  and he was probably  or  i was at my uncles house who was hosting a party for his friends because i didnt really know anyone i was talking to that boy because he was alone too and i was bored as hell 

as we were talking i realized that this kid was so obnoxious and privileged he was boasting to me about having a better phone than me and having a huge room in his house he also made a snarky remark about my dress being super ugly and that i would cause boys to run the other way if they saw me i know he was joking saying that but sometimes jokes just piss you off when they come from an entitled kid

soon the conversation went about horror movies and getting possessed thats when i had the genius idea of saying the conversation would be more fun in a dark room he excitedly agreed too so i took him to the room i was sleeping in at my uncles house

thats when i locked the dark room with us in it and started acting possessed i turned the flash on my phone on and started making all these horrific sounds to  get him scared it definitely worked because he got really scared and crying thats when i cut it short because i didnt want his parents hearing him and getting mad at me but im ngl seeing an entitled kid cry felt so good in the moment in my defense i did console him after and hugged him until he stopped crying and felt better and i apologized but we didnt talk for the rest of the day  

i do feel bad now because that kid was only  and was immature i certainly wasnt the best  year old either sometimes i wonder if he still remembers me as the possessed girl who scared him

edit guys i hugged him and comforted him until he stopped crying i promise i wasnt totally horrible

and pls stop labeling me a creep  its normal in our households for all the kids to be put in one place while the adults have their own space it just so happened that we were the only kids in the party stop putting your own insecurities in this situation and thinking that im a creep for talking to a  year old
this was a few years ago but ill give yee all  the basic rundown of what exactly happened

when i was in th year in ireland my mates and i were out and bout in town and it was getting late so we decided to take this shortcut that led to a parking lot in this parking lot we stopped and sat on this little wall when one of my mates got the bright idea that someone should jump on this peugeot  in the far corner and try and make it on to the roof of the car

me being dumb back then i agreed i start running while my mate records me and i jump on the mask of the car and slip and the next thing you know  all we heard was a crack sound i look at it and see the window did in fact crack we left right after that but i decided to come back the next day and to my surprise the car was still there i felt pretty bad about it so i left a  euro on the windshield to hopefully cover the damages

 i still wonder what happened to that car or how the owner reacted maybe he noticed or maybe he didnt as the car was already pretty beat down
i dont know what to call it or if im just lazy but im completely unable to pursue my education past high school its been a few years since i graduated and my sole attempt at college was a single online class more than a year ago which i promptly lost motivation in and failed ive kept myself working just to have some cash but everyone in my family and my closest friends online and offline all believe im getting my associates degree so i can then transfer to a  year college to complete my bachelors ive promised myself that ill start going to college once i start therapy again and ill break the news to my parents and ask for help but i cant my parents never took news like this well which is part of the reason why i think i compulsively hide so much from them i barely scraped by my junior and senior years of high school including failing a few easy classes and having to drop out of certain academic programs 



now time is running out before im supposed to move out and go to a proper college and im stuck in a lie i never applied to any collegesscholarships in high school another thing i neglected then and being accepted to a  year college at this point is probably out of the question due to my poor track record the clock is ticking for me to do something anything i guess
last christmas my boss made a comment that no one ever gets him a gift at the holiday party and that hes expected to do the giving he also always talks about steak so i got him a  gift card to burtons steak house i gave it to him at the party he gave me a gift it was a  scratch ticket that irritated me but i quit thinking about it then a few weeks ago he asked me to get a folder from his desk and there was the gift card i gave him under a bunch of stuff on his desk so i took it back and took my girlfriend to burtons not sorry
i was a weird child turns out i was actually autistic but nobody knew so i was bullied by adults and children alike at school when i was around  or  we had a science teacher called mrs baker she was nasty she wasnt allowed to hit pupils anymore so instead she would pinch their arm or shove them she took a dislike to me i wasnt a naughty child i was painfully shy awkward and a terrible writer she would read my work out to the class mocking its terribleness and get everyone to laugh at me she had a desk at the front of her lab she made the pupils she didnt like sit at obviously i was one of those pupils one day i scrawled some words on the desk when she wasnt looking  bastard baker bugger baker and bitch baker she found it and questioned all the pupils who she sat at that desk of course i denied it and as i wasnt a naughty child she believed me the blame went to a very rough boy in my year he got a two week detention  i sat next to him in history and he use to tell me he would rape me one day and tried to touch me between my legs he was also  so as far as i was concerned it all worked out for the best
i sold weed for about  years and had many many customers i had no job and lived a really fun life new clothes every week bla bla one day i get approached by undercover cops after i drove past them and they checked my details and found id been reported by someone who saw me dealing anyway i got arrested etc locked up but released the same night with court pending when i got back home i thought i should get rid of what i had which wasnt much because i would buy half a pound every friday and the cops got me on a friday right before i bought my next half pound i made up a bunch of sticks  gram baggies and i drove around just throwing them out the window to random people i saw these guys on scooters so i threw a couple in front of them but as i drove past i realised they were children like yrs old i saw them pick it up and get excited but i kept driving i still think about those kids and wonder if they smoked it but hope they went n gave it to their dad or older brother or some shit
my sisterinlaw tries to rub against my dick too often whenever she passes by she did it intentionally today and i knew it what a brazen sexual advance but i would never want to give her my core although she is a milking mother with heavy bulbous breasts but i would observe restraint and wilful ignorance damn she is a darling i would want to drink her milk while she keeps the baby away what a conservative btch super horny and meaty i want to gift her a waistlet for her notoriety i desire to get a good blow job while her baby takes a nap and my brother goes for work now all could think of is her why is my brother such a sissy or could it be that my sisinlaw is a nymph inputs please
we posted an ad for a free gaming console on craigslist picked a couple of people who emailed chose a walmart parking lot as the designated meet up spot for each of them exchanged their vehicle descriptions to each other they proceeded to meet up with each other thinking they were getting a free console we didnt get to witness the meet up but i imagine they were confused lol we later got emails from both of them cussing us out

edit just to clarify this was years ago when we were kids
at the pharmacy i go to there are always old people there i dont always but some of them are rude inconsiderate or just act entitled to me or someone else so i will walk by them and fart often i will crop dust multiple of them and then sit down nearby to watch them suffer
i was at a company team building event at a bowling alley the beer was flowing freely and i definitely had my share when it came time to leave it was pouring rain so hard you could barely see i got in my car and started it the windows were starting to fog over on top of the rain i backed out of my parking space and heard a thump i looked in my rear view mirror and im pretty sure it was a silver porsche theres no way i was going to try to find the owner in my condition actually im surprised i made it home
its the middle of the night and im wracked with guilt and anxiety i have a problem with alcohol and i relapsed its gotten out of control and yesterday i was drunk at the office now that ive sobered up i cant stop thinking about it and feeling like everyone might know my secret
i actually do have a neurological disordertourettsi have no idea if i spelt that right


i was homeschooled for a long time but when i was about i think i really wanted to go to middle school in person so my mother let me and for the first few days i was really nervous and the last time i went to school was the first few years of elementary and i didnt exactly behave so thats probably why i was homeschooled anyways after a few days i complained to my mom it was too hard to focus because of my tics so she told the teachers and they let me go to another room with a different teacher to help calm me down or whatever and i would fake tics even when i didnt have them which actually made it worse so i could leave the class and i would stay in the other room for like an hour which is how long all my classes were and i would just skip the subjects i didnt like and if i once got into this fight with a kid and threw something at him and the teacher got really mad but i him it was a tic and the other kid got into really big trouble and eventually my mom found out and made me homeschool again

i hope you understood my horrible grammar
so pretty self explainable  i work at a grocery store and as a result always seem to get the munchies  now normally when i have my  breaks i work  hour shifts so its mandatory each courtesy clerk gets  breaks i would occasionally buy myself a bag of chips or some hot deli food to crave my appetite but with factors of me living independently now with my brother and his bf in a apartment unit its kinda hard to scrape up enough money to pay for basic things such as snacks for when i go on break and since i only reserve my money at work for lunch breaks i have now begun taking items chips lunchables sodas and casually walking to the breakroom with it without concealing it or hiding it in my clothing  no one seems to notice and this has been going on for  years now and im worried my karma will occur  thoughts
when i see people from my past that i dont care to talk to when they come up to me to talk i act like i cant remember them i then tell them i was in a car accident in  and everything from before that is gone 

it mostly works and they say something like oh i didnt know and go about their day 

not something that im particularly proud of but its something that works for me
never told anybody this but here we go

one of my friends at the time got a new place and friendgroup and i decided to celebrate the occasion by overstaying our welcome there after two sleepless nights and a considerable amount of alcohol my friends and i found a box of ms the firecracker left in a closet by the previous tenant we had the bright idea of twisting all the wicks together and wrapping them all into a bundle so as to scare my friend the one who just got the place while he was sleeping

but wheres the fun in having all that without something to blow up for science right we scoured the place and couldnt find anything interesting so we went outside and caught a cicada we strapped the bug underneath the bundle and one of us put forth that cicadas have a lot of guts and we shouldnt make a mess on the carpet we all agreed and then i went to the fridge and got one of those off brand square cheese singles and said we could set it on that

we crept into our friends room and set down the cheese and bundle the cicada making mellow chirps from being taped down we lit the fuse and a few seconds later an earsplitting crack happened and our friend jumped out of bed in a whole new level of shock and anger we turned on the light there was the cheese unharmed laying in a divot in the floor about the size of a cantaloupe no sign of the cicada

by the time we stopped laughing and realized we had damaged the floor and that the cops were probably coming we decided that that was a pretty good time for lights out drinking

when i woke up the next day the friend we pranked had drawn obscene things all over each one of us
this was from   ish when i was an undergrad student   

i was assigned to the previously rented dvd section where we would repackage our old rented dvds for people to buy often times this meant being in the back room alone to sort through the product  anyways i had my pick of the litter back there with dvds and video games everything from the sum of all fears to grand theft auto vice city you name it

to take it a step further i started stealing from the cash register too my scheme went like this when someone had a late fee i would erase the fee with a note saying they disagreed with it

  but i wouldnt tell the customer i erased their fee i just added the  fee to whatever their total was for that transaction so if they were renting two movies i charged them for those movies  the late fee charge  i always made sure they were paying cash first because we had a list of questions we had to ask during the transaction company policy one of the first questions on the list was to ask the customer if they were paying cash or charge

this memory and confession came back to me because i was cleaning out an old closet and found what amounts to a small video store that could be operated during the bush admin 
i embarked on a new chapter of my life when i joined a retail company in a foreign land full of dreams and aspirations little did i know that the universe had a cruel twist in store for me just as i was getting my bearings the dreaded covid pandemic struck and my world turned upside down my employer facing its own financial struggles decided to cut our salaries in half leaving me teetering on the precipice of survival

days turned into weeks and weeks into months as i endured the anguish of salary delays that stretched over a year desperation gnawed at my resolve as i grappled with the daily struggle of making ends meet the concept of making means and ends meet became an intricate puzzle of survival that i had never faced before

i had always prided myself on my unwavering integrity and commitment to honest work but the relentless battle against economic hardship gradually chipped away at my spirit then out of the blue a subordinate reached out to me with an unexpected and perhaps dubious lifeline  a gift i initially refused however this colleagues determination knew no bounds and he placed the gift into my trembling hands

what began as a seemingly harmless act of goodwill soon morphed into a covert arrangement in exchange for this favor i found myself orchestrating internal concessions like duty rotations and specific staff placements these staff members needed to be strategically positioned to manipulate the system and access cash with ease over the course of eight grueling months i found myself accumulating roughly  in kickbacks

during those long months the weight of guilt slowly bore down on me the wages id lost in my reduced salary during those tumultuous two years were almost double the sum i had amassed through these clandestine deals but the guilt remained a heavy burden haunting my every waking moment

then an opportunity for redemption arose i secured a new job even though it paid less than my previous one but the prospect of a clean slate was too tempting to resist and i made the leap the guilt however did not fade

throughout my tenure at the company i had gone above and beyond i worked tirelessly often putting in more than  hours a day to ensure that the staffs personal and professional lives remained problemfree i became the guardian angel of the workplace and my colleagues idolized me for it they even implored the management to rehire me but i declined their heartfelt requests the companys refusal to address employee concerns and grant any raises left me with no choice

my secret remains hidden a confession ive never shared with anyone

edit

tldr

i got paid bribe by my subordinate to place certain people at particular shift so that they can steal from the company eg if customer pays in cash they will keep the tab open and when some one pays in card they settle against it and pocket the cash

i felt guilty and changed the job
a guy sent me a message here on reddit asking if i can rent him my orbit exchange account for those who dont know its a sport betting exchange
so i said why not 
we chatted for two hours and we both agree on  usd per month and for the sake of being legit he sent me  usd via crypto right away and then i gave him my password

he logged in into it and changed the password
because he told me earlier that he need privacy so i said its okay 

and now its been  days he disappeared into thin air 
he dont reply and i am sure he dont come online either 


so after  days i changed the password

but the thing which frustrates me is that he sounds so legit that i have already made hopes of getting those  and now its really bothering me like how can somebody sound so legit and then gone 

i felt like betrayed but if you think logically that i got  for free but still its fucking irritating
 i want those  a month
when i was  i worked in a factory that made pvc doors and windows my job was to cut through polystyrene foam with a stanley knife it was to make templates for the inside of the doors one day i was struggling with the pressure of doing my job as i worked on a production line and i had to keep up with everyone else i lay my hand on a table and in my other hand i held the stanley knifei then quickly sliced my hand open outside of hand between index finger and thumb i was rushed to hospital by one of my supervisors the cut didnt really hurt much because it was a clean slice with a new sharp blade i did have  stitches though i really did do something that stupid just to get out and eventually home from a bad day at work
i told myself id never tell anyone this but basically whats in the title

long story short i did a terrible job at asking a girl out in elementary school and it gave me a crippling fear of rejection so i never even approached girls i liked

as a teen i learned how to masturbate from a friend like i literally went into his bathroom and beat it to thoughts of my highschool crush while he waited in his room that was the first time i ever orgasmed

a friend of mine hooked me up with one of her friends who liked me shouts out to her lol that girl became my first everything my first kiss my first sexual experience my first girlfriend i thought i was gonna marry her
then she cheated on me with her ex

it destroyed me but i didnt break up with her because she cried but i did start cheating on her alot thats when i started paying for sex i dont even remember how i learned about it exactly but google is a very intuitive site so at around  or  i bought my first escorti stole the money from my dads drawer

tbh it was awesome she was beautiful and even let me hit raw and bust all over her chest and face i felt like the man i felt like a pornstar

i was also broke and didnt get to see her ever again stealing from my dad made me feel like shit
after i got a job though it was a wrap i remember paying for whatever i saw in porn older women college girls etc i had a few relationships with actual friends but i had already developed this habit i spent a shameful amount over the years but no one ever knew i just recently stopped because i managed to find a beautiful girlfriend who is literally changing my life rn


im sharing this because i want to stop lying to myself and face who i am and the decisions ive made they say its the only way forward and trust me ive tried everything else
i want to be a better man so im laying it all bare to see exactly how much work i have to do if i put it out there i cant lie anymore
thanks for reading try not to flame me too much in the comments
i feel ashamed and paranoid
tw mentions of sh suicide and psychiatric hospitals

i will start by saying since i was young i have never lied to anyone my whole personality is being honest about everything i know thats hard to believe but i really just never felt the need to lie this comes into play later on in the story

so when i turned  things started to change in ways that i never wanted to no this isnt about puberty because i was a late bloomer you see i never had many friends and always had only  friend who was my best friend i never once held back anything no matter how it sounded and thats sort of how our friendship stayed strong anyway this was at a time where i had just entered secondary school ireland and in this new environment i decided to try make friends for my first time i was never really that popular in fact the i was the opposite never talked to people that didnt talk to me and never looked for issues i had now gotten about  active friends and  best friends life was good until rd year when a new girl joined our class 

she hated me but we never spoke which was good anyway i did an interview about addictions to video games at the time and thought i was awesome upon returning to school however i was met with name calling and taunting by everyone i saw in the hallways i then got shut down by my crush and life was getting hard so i started to scratch myself to get over it eventually a half a year passes and a lie about me began to spread one of my friends had accused me of saying the n word to him this made everyone hate me more even though there was no proof i lost a few friends and my grades began to drop

i began thinking of suicide as an option eventually i attempted it after having just came out as transgender my best friend saved me and i was put in contact with the suicide hotline in ireland it is pretty hard to get into a hospital for anything until it is too late anyway i ended up in covid where i couldnt leave my house because i lived in the middle of nowhere things got better before i knew it th year had begun and school was back 

time skip  months

people in my new class no longer hated me however my grades were dropping from high s to low s and i had less motivation to do hw eventually i was known as the dumb kid i later pulled out of school to go back to my home country of belgium this was to go to culinary school anyway this new start made me lose all my friends and begin from start 

these new people hated me would fake confess love to me and my grades remained poor even in english which i had learned for  years i got into cutting and had suicidal thoughts again skip forth  months and my gp learned of this i was sent to a hospital in the paaz i stayed  weeks before release and felt no better another month passes and i am sent to another stay at a new hospital at this point i had severe paranoia manic episodes depression and anxiety i came out and things were better for a while on my medication quetiapine then arguments broke out and i was separated from my uncle and at the time polyamorous family left with only my parents i ended up worse and was sent to a psychiatric hospital for  weeks where i was then sent to jovo i stayed for  weeks out of  months before the storm arrived you see one part i left out was that i lied to get out of the hospitals and even lied to my psychologist about how i felt by this point the following were my issues

severe paranoia anxiety depression sh suicidal thoughts suspected bpd possible adhd

a month passes and now i sit here feelings of relapse my mother says i need to think of my parents and to tough it up at my job as i recently got a new job i left jovo with a lie and i feel trapped
i do some substitute teaching and teaching assistant work my dbs is perfect ive never done anything bad but i do smoke weed when i get home i wouldnt around kids but i smoke as soon as i get home i smoke


i feel like a bad person im fully aware i signed a contract where they can legally drug test me whenever they want i could get one tomorrow and fail that would be the end of my career but i hate myself so wholeheartedly that the only thing to not make me depressed and eat tons i lost weight in past  months scared to gain it back so i smoke it to let all my anxiety and depression away but at great risk


im  and female so i feel pressure to couple up and have a family aswell as my bio clock shouting at me to be this way too but when i smoke weed every night no
so when i was a teenager i had a summer job at a barbecue restaurant not spilling the name for legal purposes anyway the day this even happened i was helping the owner and his wife prep the food well sweet tea is a very big thing where im from soooo i noticed the tea looked weird i walked over to the owners and said hey can you look at the tea something weird is in it  they look at the tea and realize its a freaking cockroach so im sitting here thinking theyll pore the pitcher out wash the pitcher and make a new round of tea but no  thats not what they do in fact what the did do was scoop at the roach and proceed to tell me to continue serving the tea to customers so i did  and i feel terrible for that
i was a kleptomaniac as a teenager i stole a lot of things that i didnt need bags full of jelly beans clothes videogames hair gel you name it never from other people only from chain stores

i may have been poorer than average but i wasnt desperate and didnt even want a lot of the stuff i stole i was addicted to the rush and in a way it felt like i was in control like i was taking back something that was missing from my life by stealing from these corporations not to make myself out to be a victim i know what i did was wrong just explaining i wasnt exactly coming from the happiest of circumstances i had bad parentshome life

the  thing is just a rough estimate i dont really remember exactly how much i stole but that number seemed right to me at the time i m havent stolen anything since i was  years old though i got over it just in time for it to not fuck up my life and get me a criminal record  basically i got away with it

i do regret it though it was a waste of time and i was stealing from myself by not developing skills to earn money legitimately and starting my own business or something instead of stealing useless stuff that didnt help me well i guess it gave me a short term burst of dopamine but thats about it it was shallow

i never tell anyone about this though because even though i havent stolen anything in  years i know telling even my closest friends would damage the trust beyond repair once a thief always a thief is how the saying goes people do change but your conscious will follow you no matter where you go dont do anything you might regret

i used to think that i am someone special thought i am a hard worker but in reality cant even handle any kind of resistance offered  i give up  i seriously have zero willpower  any thought or distraction i just stop doing it thats why i can fail any plan i can think of if someone says change how you do stuff then i understand but not act on it ig like duly noted and not done since school i am always been told by teachers that he can be a topper but doesnt work for it all i want to be is the hardest worker in the world to just shut that up  that was me after school as i entered college all i have tried to do is be someone i can be proud of but now i cant seem to look myself in the mirror i am always stuck in thought of how to be better than trying to be better
my mom has chronic migraines and i occasionally get them as well but lately ive been pretending to get them nearly daily 
i have mdd adhd and probably some other stuff too and most days its so hard to get out of bed to go to school i recently joined high school and i absolutely love this school the staff and students are all so fun and i want to attend it everyday but i just cant do it 
ive been lying to my parents about my mental health getting better because no matter what i try therapy meds affirmations etc nothing works and i dont want them to get involved with this anymore than they already have 
at least twice a week i wake up and ask my mom for pain medicine to indicate i have a migraine ive been doing this since the last year of junior high 
im not actually in any physical pain but the burden of having to carry my body around and enforcing my brain to work is just so exhausting
i feel so guilty because my mom actually suffers from this stuff almost everyday and she shows genuine concern for me when i say im experiencing the same thing
why is everything so difficult
ive been in recovery for  years now and cant get past  months cleantime alcohol is my easy go to but also on clear after my divorce and losing my kids a large part of me doesnt care anymore and wants to use i raced motocross and street bikes and have  documented concussions and i feel those take a toll on my overall mental health

if yall could just send good vibes or say a prayer id appreciate it

im currently only drinking to keep the shakes and dts away
i feel so bad looking back at this my trainer was being an asshole towards me and so i got mad and stole the tips off the table that was supposed to go to her i know her acting like an ahole wasnt a good reason for me to do that but  years ago it seemed like an okay thing to do since i was mad whats your opinion
edit hey so i feel like i need to clarify some things so like im not a cardiologist or any kind of doctor most of the people in the comments here arent either i did see this one comment from someone who claims to be but thats just one comment out of  anyways let me give some more context before i even see the cardiologist they got me wearing a zio patch thingy thats gonna watch my heart rhythm for almost a whole month two weeks but thats still way more than my pcp did by listening with her stethoscope for  seconds plus ive got a cardiac stress test and an echocardiogram lined up before the first appointment my regular doc already did an ekg and it was like all good at that moment but thats just a snapshot ya know it doesnt show how my heart does its thing when im working out or at different times of the day after all these tests the cardiologist might just say youre all good girl but then at least ill know we did a super deep dive and really examined the situation closely and thats way better than what my primary care doc wouldve given me so whether or not i took those meds that i threw away thats not really relevant to the care im getting now i just wanna make sure we catch any weird stuff if its hiding in there

edit  tons of people are sharing stories about how their family member trusted their regular docs the doctor didnt take it seriously and then turned out to have some serious condition that couldve been caught earlier thats legit why i did all this im really sorry to anyone whos been through that but big thanks for sharing cause it helps me feel less alone in this thats like my total fear  ending up in that kind of mess  which is why i went with my gut on this to everyone saying that i should trust doctors more there are  million stories of people who trusted their doctors too much and almost died in some cases actually died because of it

edit  two big reasons why i didnt try the meds first those pills mightve had some bad side effects that couldve been worse than the chest pain itself and second those meds are for chest pain which isnt really what im worried about i couldve just taken tylenol if i wanted to deal with that no sweat whats really eating at me is that something deeper might be lurking in my bod thats why im seeing a cardiologist now a lot of people want to know more about the meds let me just say this the meds wouldnt have helped us find out if theres a hidden issue in there the cardiologists the one doing the heavy lifting to find that out see edit  

edit  imma keep replying to the comments this way like seriously so many comments are saying the exact same thing so this way i can respond to like  comments per edit a lot of you are trying to explain the theory of how primary care and specialists work but you know they can mess up too doctors are humans ive seen a bunch of stories here about people going to their pcp for something and the docs all like nah its nothing but then it turns out to be super bad later since they didnt catch it early i mean sure the primary care doc knows more than me but they might still miss something you know so lets say i had taken these meds and my chest pain went away thats great but like what if its just coincidence what if the pain was gonna go away on its own or what if the meds make me feel better but only bandaid the real problem thats causing the pain let me just repeat that im not freaking out about the chest pain itself i am more concerned there might be some hidden issue i just know that chest pain which happens randomly specifically during exercise is not normal i dont wanna end up like those stories where people had a serious issue their pcp didnt catch it in time and it got worse in theory that should not happen because the pcp would have known when to refer people to specialists you dont need to explain that to me since i know thats how it works in theory in reality theres a million stories in which the pcp did not catch something serious and it caused big problems later

edit  a few comments are saying that the lie might mess up my treatment later cause the cardiologist will be all like oh she tried these meds and they didnt work so now we have to handle this completely differently but im totally not stressing about that haha just read edit  the cardiologist is running all these different screenings you know the whole the meds didnt work thing wont mess with the cardiologists ability to spot any problems 

number  im not answering any more specific questions about diagnosis or treatment to everyone asking me if i will update you after i see a cardiologist no i will not do that thats not the point of this sub the point of this sub is to confess something that i feel guilty about doing and i still think i made the right decision but i feel guilty about lying to get what i want

original post

ive been a runner pretty much forever my bods used to it

recently i started getting these random chest pains when im out on my run and it seriously freaked me out so i was like okay time to see the doctor i called and made an appointment

first time the doc was like just take some advil sweetie and i was just like uh thats not why im here doc its not really about the pain i need to know if my hearts all good you know

i asked if i could see a cardiologist and shes like lets try a couple of meds first and if they dont work maybe well think about it

in the second appointment she put me on another med i went along with the plan but heres the thing i didnt take those pills she gave me i picked them up from the pharmacy and then threw all of them away then at the next appointment i lied that i had taken one pill every night before bed as she had instructed me to i said it didnt work and im still having the chest pains in spite of all this she gave me that referral to the cardiologist

i felt like i needed to what if i have an underlying heart condition were not going to catch that condition and treat it if all we do is play this guessing game with meds i wanted to see a cardiologist and i felt like lying to my doctor was the only way i could do it i dont know how insurance works but i think my insurance was only going to cover a cardiolgist if i had a referral

im not blaming my doc though this was at the county hospital and i get it shes swamped and stuff so she cant pay as much attention to every patient as she probably wants to she also cant send everyone to cardiology she has to prioritize which patients have more risk factors and refer those people she thinks im young and healthy so she figured my hearts probably fine shes probably right but i just wanted a specialists take on it you know sometimes you gotta trust your gut when something feels off in your body 
ive been clean for nearly  years life has been rough as hell over the past week or so and i feel like im losing everything im so upset because of how hard i worked to get where i am but i just dont know where to go or what to do now 

i dont know what in me brought me to using i just want to take back the decision i made to get here
a few days ago i stole a cleanser from target and then the next day i stole two cheap makeups from spirit halloween ive never borrowed before but a feeling to do it has been nagging me i feel super bad im only  but i feel like a criminal i guess i just did it because so many school friends i know to do

to summarize i stole
note the period on the title is just because this sub needs  characters to be able to post

so me and my wife flew to a country with a shitty airline they came out on their mandatory walk with the little trolley with nuts beer and tea on the other aisle two rows back someone made a purchase or a fuss and it made the flight attendants to look over there for  seconds leaving the trolley unguarded with their eyes 

i stole a red label whiskey and just hid it in my jacket 

i am  years old

out of curiosity will they get in any trouble for it because there is chaos on that airline everytime i doubt they actually check inventories more than refill
i got laid off from my job  summers ago and it sent me into a tailspin to be honest i was super depressed and the only job i could get was a hotel housekeeping job it was the worst  months of my life and i quit quickly while i was there i was extremely depressed and couldnt get myself to do anything correctly i just didnt care 

on different occasions i didnt replace sheets i didnt wipe down clean looking counters i didnt replace clean looking towels i didnt mop if it didnt look bad etc i took any shortcut i could i quit after only  months and i still feel bad

i f got into a big argument with my brother m because he wasnt letting me have a sleepover at my friends house i know he was looking out for me but it was still frustrating because i know i would be safe at the house and wouldnt go outside with my  friends where it may be dangerous 

because he wasnt letting me i may have got a bit too agitated and started screaming at his face for being too overbearing but basically that was his tipping point and he pushed me really hard to the ground and started being really rough with me because he was fed up with it thats when i just gave up on trying to convince him because i knew it was no point and i was getting scared i couldnt do anything but cry that night but my anger still wasnt gone 

thats why a few days later i decided to break his side car mirrors to get back at him i took some silver tool idk what its called  and smashed his side mirrors and i tried bending the mirror down i hate to admit it but it felt so good in the moment because i was still pissed

in the end he found out the next morning and called the local township about it he was really mad because he just got the car like last year even then i didnt regret it because the night he didnt let me go to the sleepover was still fresh in my mind plus how rough he got towards me really ticked me off

a month later i cant help but feel guilty for being the one to break his side mirrors he still hasnt found out he really does care for me even if hes a bit too overprotective and i understand where hes coming from because i did have a few interactions with creeps when ive been alone we only have each other since our parents are not in our lives anymore so i get hes looking out for me

 it didnt really affect him financially because he is well off thankfully i just dont know if i should confess to him what i did because i know hell be angry
for context young me was frankly an avid liar
i think kid me found pride in being able to convince my friends that some bullshit i made up was actually real 

you know bullshit such as
 a portal to an underground world opening up on the wheat field at midnight and an alien species living there
 me owning the worlds smallest cameras and holding out an empty hand before saying its so small you probably cant even see it
 me having walked to germany

flashback to  when i was in th grade
i have always loved spooky and paranormal stuff so of course i ended up hearing about the entire charlie charlie challenge that began trending that year 
basically all you needed was a paper and two pencils write down yes on opposing corners of the paper no on the two remaining opposing corners and then you place a pencil on the paper before balancing the other on top of it
the player would then ask something and presumably receive a reply through the top pencil moving towards yes or no

of course i wanted to introduce my buddies to it
so we got a paper and two pencils brought it out at recess and set it up on a picnic table outdoors before one of us asked out loud charlie charlie are you here
when nothing happened my classmates began to question if this was just some more of my bullshit a small sigh of disappointment left my body through my nostrils and the air from that sigh managed to move the pencil over the paper

everyone involved flipped their shit seeing the pencil move to one of the options
of course we continued with this since it worked and if the wind itself from us simply being outdoors didnt move the pencil i myself would exhale out my nostrils to make it move
freaking out every time it happened no matter the question nor answer

somehow the teachers ended up finding out about this whole thing and all of us ended up receiving emails home to our parents saying something along the lines of them requesting students stop attempting to summon demons on school grounds

this put an end to our fun since nobody wanted to get busted for that shit

not the most exciting story ever nor the best explained but its so funny to me thinking back on and i must say i kinda do view it as an accomplishment
id love to try to find that email again one day
occasionally my mind wanders into your memory over the years ive pushed it away tucked it deep into the dark corners of my mind but you never fully stow away no matter how hard i try to forget you i still think of you

i think about your voice and how we could communicate with the slightest vocalizations and knew exactly what each other was thinking i think about how just listening to you say my name or tell me you loved me would make my stomach twirl with butterflies and my heart ache with longing even a small breath from you stirred in the most intense desire from me

i think about your eyes the most beautiful pine green freckled with golden and chesnut hues that danced around your iris i think about how they would soften when you spoke to me in the beginning and how bright and full of life your eyes were when you told me about your day i think about how i could have gotten lost in them forever if you would have let me 

i think about your hair its dark soft strands tickling my cheeks as you kissed me i think about the scars on your back i used to trace them as we lie together skin to skin i thought that you were beautiful even with the scars that you thought werent worth loving

i think about if you are happy do you finally feel at home with your family have you found your place as the artist you dreamed of becoming have you seen the places we dreamed of going have you found someone who loves you do you love them back just as much

i think about you but then i remember 

i remember that i was never first something to be used when convenient i remember all the girls names that you slept with behind my back i remember that you promised over and over that you would be different that i was the love of your life i remember that it never became different 

i remember that i always loved you infinitely more than you loved me back i loved you as hard and as consistent as i possibly could but no matter how hard i tried i could never be enough i remember how my heart shattered again and again for years until i was a shell of the young girl i was once 

i remember how i had to package the memory of you and put it into the darkest corners of my mind i remember this is what i needed to do to survive losing you to survive forever loving you with no love in return

i still think of you 

i wish i didnt
this  yr old man im  has been sxually harassing me at my new job literally since the first week and my co workers are starting to catch on and the ones who know are telling me  to go to hr but im too chicken to say anything im a past victim of da at a very young age so i struggle to speak up when i feel uncomfortable i can tell this is serious because im not wanting to tell my friends about it whod i normally gossip with i tried to talk to my bf about it and his response was wtf is wrong with you lmao stop complaining about it then idk what to do ive just been letting it happen and it want it to stop

update its been  days since i posted this and he was there today im tryna keep my distance but he kept asking where i had been i worked nights for  odd shifts hes mornings he came up again later to say that we get off at the same time so we could walk to our cars together two blocks away needless to say i stayed  hours past my shift 
also he was being so invasive that my supervisor asked if we were family today
my wife would rather get fucked in the ass than suck my dick what would you ladies choose
my now ex bestfriend has become a bad person and i think im to blame shes become a gaslighting manipulative person that cheats on her boyfriend and makes sexist comments about men and it all started with her getting arrested for shoplifting which i think i influenced

i knew what she was doing before she was arrested i remember one moment she specifically asked me is this bad should i stop she was a very fragile person that came from a rough background my idiot self shouldve told her to stop but instead i said i mean if its not from small stores just big companies its not so bad

i basically said that shoplifting was an okay thing to do i even joined her with it but i only did it when i was with her basically influencing her to do it then she got arrested struggled with animal hoarding and treats men terribly basically her life went down the drain and she became bitter

shes cheated on her boyfriend and ive kept my mouth shuti feel bad i didnt say anything to him shes called all men easy pigs and free d laughing at pictures theyve sent her she cheats on her boyfriend regularly and her excuse is that shes just young shes outright told me that she doesnt take criticism and she prefers me to keep all my opinions to myself 

i feel horrible ive been thinking about that day if i had said yes its bad stop it she mightve actually stopped and she wouldnt have spiraled i feel like a horrible person
i always grab a handful of the hershey caramel and caramel macchiato creamers sometimes the irish cream too its not like im broke or anything i have a full bottle of creamer at home but the fun flavors tempt me and i cant help myself i use them for iced coffee concoctions all the time and they even have espresso shots so i take at least  of them
so i got a new job about  months ago and when i joined i was asked if i wanted to pay  a month out of my wage towards the tea and coffee club  which meant unlimited drinks for the month 

i declined as i wasnt that bothered about it

after one month or so of being there i got offered a coffee by my boss so i accepted then as time has gone on people in my team keep making me brews and i return the favour but nothing has come out of my wage and i know they all pay towards it monthly

not a massive deal but its a little win for me each day i do feel a little guilty and i wonder if i will ever get caught 
lied about things for attention i ended up hurting peoplei should have never done those things one thing being that i lied about having cancer when i think of all those people that have died from or lost a loved one to cancer it makes me hate myself more and more
today as i was backing up i rubbed up against the side of another vehicle i parked and waited for the driver to come back i had the company insurance ready to hand over to him but he just laughed saying look at my van its already banged up and not to worry about it

the company vehicle im in which isnt labeled is scratched up already and i cant tell if i added more scratches im sure i did i havent told my boss and its bothering me not sure if i actually need to i feel like i did the right thing in the parking lot by waiting for the other guy its my second week on the job first time driving a heavy duty vehicle too thoughts
last night i was driving home from the gym while trying to make a legal right on red a teenager came flying into the crosswalk on his bike luckily i had just started moving and just knocked him down bike looked fine and after the kid calmed down he said he was alright his mom showed up and she was very calm and friendly about it saying accidents happen and her son was fine i gave them my name and phone number and said reach out if they need anything just feel very anxious about the whole thing and dont want to tell anyone around me out of fear of their reactions to the whole thing 
so last year i was an absolute wreck i would come home from work change out of my work clothes lay down on the sofa and stay there until i had to get up to shower for work the next morning dinner was a glass of chocolate milk i wouldnt even remove my makeup 

i had no friends and would only leave my house to go to work grocery shop and visit my sick parents

so i hit frick it and went out by myself

now i am a  woman who looks  lbs soaking wet it wasnt smart of me to go out alone and i acknowledge that but i was just so desperate to go out and do something

anyway i figured i would be fine did some pre drinking at home and had a few shots of whiskey when i was out i hadnt had alcohol in a while and my tolerance was shot so i ended up getting way more trashed than i intended

i remember nothing about driving from the last club to my house when i came to my senses i was legitimately disgusted with myself

you could have killed someone i thought oh my god what if you did what if you hit a pedestrian without realizing it

i scoured the news for days after but didnt see anything it really messed me up and i havent been bar hopping since

im lucky that i didnt kill anyone im lucky that i didnt get kidnapped or worse

since then ive taken steps to fix myself i got a puppy and having something to take care of and dote on has really helped enough that everyone i know has told me that im much better 

my puppy honestly saved my life i sometimes feel like i dont deserve her both because i was disgusting enough to do this and because i feel like a horrible person in general sometimes but thank god i have her 

just felt like sharing because i was thinking about it earlier i have a friend who was involved in a collision with a drunk driver as a kid his mom died in that crash

i promised him i wouldnt drive drunk and i broke that promise we dont hang out anymore but he is a good guy and i feel horrible whenever i think about it and him
well i regret it at first i thought it was alright since im also a minor but now that ive actually done it i feel disappointed in myself ive sent it to  people i wish i could delete those drawings from the chat but i deleted my account because of the sheer amount of disappointment i felt i wont be drawing anything nsfw related ever again i promised myself that but the guilt still remains
its something that i still regret to this day so for context we are a family of  mom dad me  younger brothers lets call them a and b and a younger sister lets call her c we are all pretty close now as when we got older we realized our parents were both neglectful and toxic in our childhood we still love them but they were not good at parenting and were borderline abusive

anyways to the bullying me and a are a year apart when i was  b was born our parents started to neglect both me and a when b was born and at the start this didnt bother us since we were excited for the new member of our family as time passed though we started to get bitter when b was about  we started bullying him it was small stuff at first like not playing with him and not sharing our stuff we just started isolating him from our playtime and never acknowledging his existence we were  years old so we should have known better but it gets worse

the bullying got worse over the years where we would get physical at this point in time b was going through both physical and emotional abuse from both me and a we never hit him hard because wed get in a lot of trouble at the time but im sure the mental shock from getting hit by your own family hurt much more the worst thing done physically to b was when i threw a dart at him it lodged into his arm and he started crying fortunately he wasnt too injured and the injury was patched with a small bandage

some years pass and i was  when the youngest was born our sister c was born and all of our fighting temporarily halted we showered c with love but yet again our parents started neglecting b now along with us it was fine though because we were slightly older and we were happy that we finally got a girl in the family eventually though we started abusing b again

the emotional abuse had gotten even worse over the years at this time both me and a were close to teenagers  and definitely should have known right from wrong we were still isolating b but not physically abusing him anymore i was much worse than a though a started to light up on the abuse towards b whereas i would put b down whenever i got the chance and acted disgusted at the sight of him i wouldnt even let him touch me or id flip since b was getting older he started to fight back against the abuse and would yell back i didnt get too mad at this and thought it gave me the green light to keep bullying him since he was resisting which in my mind at the time this meant we were on equal grounds we were definitely not i was  years older than him i should have fucking known turns out b was also getting bullied at school he never told us anything i mean why the fuck would he we were one of his tormentors too im sure he told our parents but they never said anything to us or did anything about it i really wish they would me and a would bully b but if we had known others were doing so we would have done something about it we kind of had a only we can do this to b mentality as bad as that sounds

as even more years passed a started getting along with b more i was still abusing b but it was not to the extent of when we were children b also fought back even more now and would argue back with me it sort of evolved to normal sibling banter from there but i was super mean with it there was no more isolation tactics or physical abuse especially since c was also getting older and she kind of brought us all together since we spoiled and loved her a lot

fast forward to me getting into college at  i stopped the abuse towards b by this time it wasnt until i was  when we started to actually get along as years pass we had a normal sibling relationship he was finally free from my torment but the damage had already been done through combination of my bullying at home and the bullying he faced at school he developed severe clinical depression im pretty sure b has never fully forgiven me as i had never apologized even though the guilt still eats at me to this day i paid for bs therapy and tried to make up for the past by buying them gifts and food b has a very sarcastic and humorous personality we have a relationship where he would call me cringe and try to stop me if i tried to make a sincere apology verbally so ive been trying to make it up to him through my actions

it wasnt until i was  when i had this realization of how badly i treated b i knew it was bad but for some reason the epiphany didnt hit me until then i paid for his therapy but he wouldnt need it if it werent for me i bought him gifts but none of those will bring back his childhood he talks to me and jokes around with me but deep down i dont deserve this every now and then he will bring up a traumatic thing i did to him in a joking manner ex remember when you an a would do this and that to me damn you guys were assholes laughs he says that it doesnt affect him now and that it made his personality more interesting but i know deep down he has resentment towards us i dont blame him one bit either

we are all adults now and we are all close we kind of made a support group for siblings with bad parents as the eldest i take them out to eat every month so we can talk about life and catch up on things b seems to be doing better than before but the guilt eats at me i see his smile and it doesnt reach his eyes i caused that

i dont feel any better getting this off my chest every line and memory i wrote down hit even harder and made me realize what a garbage human being i am i dont think ill ever be able to say this outloud in real life

im so sorry b for all the years of abuse i put you through im so proud of the person you were able to become even after all youve been through you are such a strong person much stronger than any of us i wish you nothing but happiness and i want you to know that even if im not there i will always have your back
when i was about  or  years old i was left home alone while both my dad and my sister went shopping at the local supermarket it wasnt the first time but it certifiably wasnt a typical event all things considered while home i got bored and decided to open the front door and dash to my friends house aka my neighbors by myself telling their older brother who had answered the door that my dad let me go i stayed there for about  minutes before my family came back and noticed the front door wide open of course there were consequences and my alibi was automatically disproven when they showed up to their house turns out after running to their house my friend wasnt even home and i got scolded for many hours and it was brought up for and entire week at the dinner table the next time my family left to go shopping i just stayed home and watched netflix now after many many years what my parents and sibling mustve endured and realized was quite scary and ill definitely not be doing that ever again
update i signed up to ta for the special ed pe next year very excited and hope to make the most of all your advice thank you all so much

i dont know if this is the right subreddit if any one of you know of a better sub to post this please tell me ive had some trouble for a while trying to find a way to behave around disabled people i have great empathy for them i understand that they are just normal people oftentimes some of the better of us who just happen to have unfortunate disabilities i know i should just treat them with the same respect i treat anyone else with and i do but when i walk down the halls of my highschool and the group of kids who are disabled maybe they have down syndrome or are severely autistic or whatever else i cant make eye contact i feel all around uncomfortable when around them i have been doing a lot of community service both at school and in my town and i enjoy it very much and go to most every event i have the opportunity to go to recently ive been asked to volunteer and be a buddy to a disabled person for a basketball tournament i feel it would be the right thing to go to i love my community all around and i certainly love everyone regardless of their handicaps i know with every bone in my body that kindness is the way to go and i have never shown anything but kindness to these people but my heart still feels a sort of reluctance or even repulsed in some way and i dont know why ive always been very self conscious i have been afraid when i was younger that i myself was disabled in this way how would i know if i were or werent i guess that fear lasts to this day my brother is also autistic but very functional i feel very comfortable around him i admire him very much i dont know i know that i feel wrong inside how do i put this behind me get over my fear or whatever shallow feelings i have i feel terrible



 ive been working at my job for a while now  which i wont disclose where i work for obvious reasons but ever since i worked here i realized how much boxes i find empty or open and the item or product missingstolen in the back you see all the stuff ppl stole and stuff were never gonna get again and stuff theyre not gonna look for and by that i mean they wont try to find out who did it working there really opened my eyes to how stores treat theft and let me tell you mine didnt do jack shit for it and one time when i was closing and putting back some miscellaneous items around the store i found something ive been wanting and i saw i was alone and i just took it impulses took over and i never got caught or no one even noticed tbh cause the store is so big after this i realized how much more i could steal from work as my work sold everything from food to clothes to home decor i was at work one time and it clicked  
i never saw it this way  i started seeing how easy it is to steal and so started a  month period where i could not control my urges and i just stole basically everything i could stuff and hide into my clothes or pants or person and it was cool tbh having a bunch of cool ass stuff that is kinda expensive i guess for nothing at all it was so easy i would literally build my outfit around baggy stuff bc it would be easier to hide stuff and harder to notice in my mind while i did this i was getting paranoid and wondering maybe theres something i dont know about that they do to catch ppl like me or maybe someones gonna check the cameras bc the camera definitely caught me doing shit but they just dont check them at all  i was thinking all sorts of bullshit but at the end of the day when i went back to work everything was fine and no one had any clue about what i was doing i also didnt do it all dumb i would wait for the perfect moments like when i knew no one was in the office with the cameras and away from my area i would strike and man i stole so much ashamed to admit it i would get paranoid af but i would always end up doing it again i just couldnt pass up the opportunities is what i would tell myself and the stuff i was stealing was the same of the type of thing lets call em home decor i was stealing a lot of decor and they started noticing all these empty ass boxes and broken items they eventually put alarms on all the stuff i was taking but they were acting all normal with me even telling me like yeah people keep stealing the  and i was like damn and since then i havent stolen anything but there is some stuff without alarms and everyday when i go to work i just have so much urges to do it and i cant help it is there term for this  is something wrong with me lol and i also want to stop now so i dont get deeper into this theft life

edit i forgot to mention when im at work and i dont steal everything feels wrong like im body doing whats best for me or whats right which ik isnt whats best it just makes me feel uneasy when i dont steal
i was at a train station and had to pick up my sister at the airport already slightly late i had  minutes before catching the train to go to her the next one would have been  minutes later while waiting i was approached by a woman about  years old with her little daughter she asked me to buy some groceries for her so that she and her daughter could eat i tried to give her money instead but she insisted i accompanied her instead so i agreed but i explicitely told her that it couldnt take more than  minutes because of the train she accepted

i regretted it almost instantly she took a cart and started basically ransacking the supermarket taking in  apart from lots of the normal groceries  pans pots glasses several  packs of red bulls lot of junk food and so on i roughly counted the expenses and after a good  minutes it was amounting already almost to  furthermore at the  minutes count she was still taking her time with no end in sight

stressed out at the thought of missing my train having a public confrontation and being unpolite to someone in difficulty i just ran away i dont know whether i should but months later i still think and feel bad about it

xb
ive wished death on people out of rage i got someone expelled after he kept being a jerk to me i called people horrendous names ive made physical contact without permission uninvited hugs or rubbing of the back ive told a relative they were dead to me i have broken numerous girls hearts ive ruined days for people by being mean to them and even yelled at people till they cried its so much stuff across my entire life that ive done and i sometimes wonder if im a bad person or if whatever i do to atone will ever be enough


edit i appreciate the honest criticism ive gotten from people in the comments its what i needed to hear
i work weekend overnights in the er friday night  monday morning because it gives a great pay bonus i also am training to have an advanced medical imaging certification during the week all day wednesday and thursday which is unpaid so im at work  days a week right now i only have  of  exams i need to test for my certification and i only have  weeks of training left because im leaving for  weeks over seas to go to my brothers wedding i am not going to miss my other siblings wedding because most of my family is dead and my dad cant afford to go i am so overwhelmed trying to get all my shit done and get enough sleep to function i need this higher certification to make more money because im single pay for everything myself because any roommates have always burned me so i live alone
everything is so expensive i cant believe how much rent is and how high food costs are i feel like a running on fumes and i still have a month and a half left of this non stop bs it feel like there is no end i want to be able to enjoy my time off but im worried about just getting basic pto and missing training for  weeks putting me behind i cant sleep at night because i wake up worried and feeling sick like depression i wish it was all over because i just dont feel right anymore im burnt and sick 
any online hugs and support or sweet words will help
so i dont really know how to start this confession off i also dont know how to word it without it being super long so feel free to ask questions in the comments this post is going to be so jumbled and chaotic for that im sorry i might as well just say it 

i f have massive feelings for my best friend m i know what you are thinking its awful i know believe me i know we have been close since high school and have known each other years before that in high school we didnt formally date but we went on a few dates and talked however he ended up dating another person and they are still together to this day 

my best friend and i talk literally almost every day without fail however i just feel like i am lying to them every time we talk because of these feelings i know we wont end up together and i would never do anything to destroy his relationship i just wonder what it would be like if we ended up together 

another reason it is weird for me is because hes never actually given a reason for not dating me other than saying he is glad he didnt date me in high school because he couldnt stand the thought of losing me or hurting me we have talked about what happened before but out of awkwardness from both of us we just joke about it its just killing me to know what i did am i just not attractive are we not compatible im just so unsure of what i did wrong 

as i said before we talk everyday we are very similar and very different people at the same time we can talk easily for hours about nothing and everything hes said a few things to me that just make my heart melt i guess im just so unsure of my own feelings right now but i cant help but feel awful

edit im getting a lot of questions on why i cant just cut off all contact with him i didnt mention it before because it requires some back story tw

he attempted twice in high school i was there through all of it while a lot of his friends left him he went to the mental hospital  times throughout high school so he dropped out of school this caused him to get disowned by his parents 

around this time he slept around with multiple girls i was not one of them although we did go on a couple of dates during this time by my senior year i ended up going out with someone else because of this and he started dating his current gf 

because he was disowned he got his own place his gf moved in due to having an abusive family another friend of ours was looking for a roommate they were old enough to the main person on the lease so they all got a place together during my senior year i ended up homeless so my best friend reached out to have me stay with them 

i am currently in college i go and stay with them on breaks during breaks we have to pay extra to stay and i just cant afford that
when i was in th standard i used to trouble a boy who just minded his own buisenessi didnt knew then what i was doing to his mental health and self esteemi was just too stupid to know betterwhen i got bullied i realised how big of a pussy i wasi never felt that much guilt in my life and i literally hated myself for what i didbut in the end i made up with him and now he is one of my bestest buddy
i know its disgusting and i wince at the thought of ever being caught in the act  but see im really good  like what they call a generational talent  i can drop a boogy ball behind your leather sectional like a ninja  tissues  save those for yourself and your family  me  ima just leave this mucous membrane all along the back of your chaise loungeno tissues required
my vajayjay fluids wet the toilet paper and i can use that as wet wipe 
i know its weird af so my husband doesnt know
today  was my mother birthday she is now  years old when my grandma was alive no matter our situation we always got something special on birthdays it was the same with me i may not had a party every year but it was always something special a food that i really liked or even something like cheeseburgers as lunch 
nowadays i am the adult y and i tried my best to do something special for her i am a veterinarian and i work really hard on nightshifts last month i was a overachiever and got my record in comissions just to have money this month to do something special my payday should be at th day of each month but i havent got fully payed this month so today we had to eat microwaved lasagna the best i could buy was a pack of cigarrets for  cents

i think i failed as a son that i am unable to provide her the bare minimum and deep down i also think she should not have adopted me i am truly sorry

im a  m and as the title says i really fucked up but for those of you reading this please take it to heart an never do what i did let me start off by saying i had a girlfriend for  years and they where the best  years of my life there were a lot of struggles with my family and hers but guys this was the love of my life we were through so much stuff stuff nobody should be put through but we did everything together and stuck through everything but that stuff doesnt come with no consequences i started feeling apathetic i hated everything i developed severely demented and sadistic thoughts on those who had wronged us but i acted like it was natural i completely lost feelings and growing up i was hardwired into thinking that men suffer in silence and thats what i did i didnt even realize i pushed my girlfriend at the time away i was numb and emotionless and after about half a year of feeling this way we both decided to breakup and i realized that those thoughts and everything i had on my shoulders was due to her family not her her dad was a recovering alcoholic and he was doing good until his dog meat looking girlfriend decided she wanted more attention and realized she could only get that if hes drunk her dad abused her little sister and little brother on separate occasions and i was there beside her every step of the way her dad disowned her and attempted to manipulate her but neither of us let that happen i almost went to jail because of these instances this girl saved me from my home life as well my dad is an alcoholic as well but not on the same level as hers my moms manipulative and nothing i ever did was good enough regardless of how good i did it there are so many more things but those were by far the worst guys when you find love dont let anything break it its hard its gonna drag you in the mud and rip you apart do not suffer in silence as i did talk to your significant other express yourself or else youll loose everything you care about like i have i realized i loved her too late and i honestly dont know what to do with my life anymore i miss her so much but shes gone for good please guys girls take this to heart so you dont suffer how i am
im sorry for the bad writing this is my first post but i needed to get this off my chest thank you for reading
so long story short my name is v and im  i live in ukraine my whole life was a mess tbh i am the only child in the family and my father my closest person and friend was murdered when i was  my life went downhill from there i was  times in a alcohol rehab by the age of  i still continue to drink but dont let myself go into benders when the war began it almosed finished me mentally im still derealized and depersonalized since then my yearlong girlfriend cheated on me this june and it was a major heartbreak as well i think of myself as a very caring and genuine person i care too much and im very emotional but the things i do  like selling drugs and findibg employees for a scamming company makes me feel awful i earn good money but in what way i dont even know why im posting it i just feel fucking awful i just have to do it to maintain my life 
it feels like i went insane at some point and theres nothing left from the person ive been before i feel nothing not one emotion total emptiness and regret thats it
i am extremely lucky at finding money i have found lots and lots of  coins  coins and other coins i  have found twenty  notes around ten  notes and at least five  notes once a women lived near me and she went rushing down the road saying she had dropped  little did she know that i had already found it spent some of it and had the change in my pocket as she told me twice i  have found   once on a train and another time in the street and on christmas eve i  found  hanging out a cash machine in a shop nice of someone to give me that for christmas lol  i grab them quick  and pocket them  i have found at least eleven wallets and purses the biggest ones are a purse with nearly   in it  another wallet with  etc in it one wallet i found i took the cash out  pocketed it and then went to the address in it and pushed the wallet and bank card etc  through their letter box  another with  in it just got that cash out in time before the  conductor on the train handed it in and i  saw a bag on a seat left down by a river  i looked in it as nobody was looking and i am glad i did the was  in it  around     i took it out and kept it  money drops down in amusement arcade machines in front of me without me putting any in   i often see people drop money  usually  coins  in front of me so i wait until they are gone and pick it up thanks people this year i had my biggest find yet i  was going to work and found    around    laying all in  notes and one   near where i  live i think one of my neighbors lost it  i picked it up kept quiet and spent it all a couple of days later  i  did the right thing as nobody ever asked me about it i  would possibly have said i had not seen it if they had  i do sometimes pick up pennies etc most times i go out and find something  i think this is quite unusual my mum says that i  am lucky i would like to find thousands in a bag dumped somewhere  you would not hear of me handing it in i would spend it on a very important person me if  i find another  or so  i will have found k in my lifetime  but would you feel lucky or guilty if you was me   i ask  just out of interest
names are fake and this is my first post on reddit so sorry if its bad

so i am f and my friend ally f were sparring at a martial art competition and im not bragging but sparring is one of my talents what i excel at this was the round where we were competing for st and nd one more thing to add is ally loves to punch so she was coming in on me punching and i wanted to get out of it so i did the first thing that came to my mind and i pretended to trip we centered back up came back to the middle of the mats and stated again i ended up winning the round and i probably would have still won even if i did fall i know this isnt very crazy or the most interesting confessions on here but i just feel like a jerk and i may have cost her the round 
yeah that sounds pretty depressing for the record this isnt a confession but a way to let this part of me i hide off my chest

really it started a long time ago when i was a kid and i couldnt sleep id imagine myself in a story itd be whatever something like a superhero that i saw on tv that day well fast forward  years and now i have the do something like this to fall asleep

its fair to say that i was recently diagnosed with adhd which is probably a big reason for my insomnia however the important parts of this come into play about a year ago

for some reason ive never cared much about marvel ive always been a massive indiana jones fan and nothing else i remember seeing the first guardians of the galaxy movie when i was little this planted some seed in my dumbass brain now after seeing the third film ive realized how much i love the character of rocket of course plenty of people do but i think as a kid i connected with his constant pushing away of other people i never had a good social life until recently another thing was that i found a comic from someone who i cant remember the name of about a man who moves into the middle of nowhere and befriends a teenage werewolf and a witch i thought it was ok but never enough to peak my interest for a long time

why does any of this matter well ai blew up in the past couple years and i realized something i could use it to tell myself stories to help myself sleep

so i came up with the worst idea possible id make a story about me just myself nothing special itd be the people around me who are special i imaged i had met another kid my age who happened to be a werewolf figured itd be more interesting to have him just do it whenever he wants break all the stereotypes or whatever for jokes and it just got out of hand eventually the story led to me getting sick from some magical terminal disease bs this linked up with a lot of my depression at the time and suicidal thoughts and for some stupid reason i have to get turned into an animal because this disease only kills humans so then i became stuck as a raccoon basically imagine rocket raccoon anatomy anyway the rest of the story is just me hanging out with this friend nothing actually abnormal besides what we are

now i knew this was unhealthy but i figured because i used aspects of my real life to transfer over to this story it was ok mainly my depression and desire to fit in with the world after being stuck beside fake friends translating into me being isolated from the world in the story since a talking raccoon cant go out and socialize i also finally met people who cared about me and shared my interests a few years ago and they became my friend in the story while everything in the story is stupid and nonsensical it all stems from my real life experiences

im in way too deep now ive been generating the same story for over a year keeping like a book i only look at it and write more before i sleep for the record ive never thought of myself as a furry ive never been into that stuff and have had some pretty uncomfortable experiences with furries but maybe i am one based on this if so i hate myself even more because of how im hiding it deep down inside of me

still i have had this as a secret for so long now no one knows not even my closest friend to who i tell everything it never slips into my daily life and i never feel this need to live this second life any other time however my problem is that this fantasy has become so detailed and real that sometimes when i drive alone or have time with my thoughts i just wish it was my life that i had this amazing life i think by making myself the character in the story i have basically tied my emotions to it

i will probably keep doing this for who knows how long its so embarrassing i just need to throw it out and away maybe if some random people know about this story it will let me feel like i wont go to my grave holding it to myself

if you even read this whole thing god rest your soul and please dont call a therapist i already have one
so in my algebra class there is this guy i sit next to it started off just like any other day and class just started and the teacher hasnt gone up to the board and started teaching the guy next to me i happened to glance at his screen and saw something inappropriate he was scrolling through photos and i saw a photo of two men holding hands and they had a condom in the middle another photo i saw there were two men were on top of each other just from where i was sitting it made me feel pretty uncomfortable it was kind of in my view and then when class ended i went up and told the teacher about what happened and what i saw and then i left to find the principal and report it

i told him exactly what i told the teacher and what he was looking at and then i said what he was looking at one his computer made me feel uncomfortable and then he said he was going to check it out
i want to start by saying i dont not have munchausen syndrome i love my kids and i dont want them to be sick anyways my daughter started having episodes of breath holding abnormal eye movements and lethargic type symptoms after these episodes the first time it happened i took her in and truthfully told them what happened i was told its probably breath holding spells its pretty scary for new moms and we were sent home the diagnosis didnt sit right with me over the course of a month the episodes were more frequent happening everyday multiple times a day she had an episode where it lasted  minutes so i took her to the er exaggerated the symptoms and they did additional tests  hr eeg and mri the tests confirmed that she in fact has epilepsy not breath holding spells

i had school today and outside we had a rat for some reason outside in the tables during lunch everyone ran but the rat was calm and waddling around then some random kid came up and grabbed it by its tail and started showing it off

i took a photo of him holding it and i posted it to my schools page where you take photos of classmates or random people in your school i thought it was funny so i wanted to share it it actually ended up getting over  likes and now i feel like an as for blasting this kids face all over he is only a freshman

i regret it because i never asked to take a photo of him and i immediately regretted it after messaging the owner of the account but once i deleted it they already screenshot the image

i hope he doesnt dwell on it tomorrow i hope that photo gets buried quick by other students

its an ig page where you just submit images so i cannot remove it
hi guys

so just need to get this off my chest back in  during a company event we were all celebrating and closing out the end of the rd q for the company we were at the office until super late maybe ish and some of our coworkers continued the party and didnt some of us to their outing

a coworker and i met up and we were gonna make plans but he then ended up bailing on me and i decided to go back to the office and drive home shit faced and at this moment i saw that coworkers car in the lot and i was filled with this seething rage and something came over me and i proceeded to take my car keys out and placed it on the side of his door and spun around the entire vehicle like  times
i f snag a couple bills out of the petty cash safe at work when im struggling to make ends meet i work in business admin at a very large corporate company there are three other women who work with me and part of our responsibilities is dealing with all money coming in and out i have taken responsibility of the petty cash  at the end of the work day it is my job to add any cash from the day to the safe and file the receipts when im short on cash ill take a few bills nothing bigger than a  and toss a receipt that matches how much ive taken when i get paid i put the cash back and no one knows
im a single mother of two in a state where the cost of living is outrageous i dont take anything big but when im in between paychecks and the little child support i get i will sometimes take a couple rolls of toilet paper and paper towels home maybe some dish soap from the kitchen not enough for anyone to notice sorry this confession isnt that juicy
the prices were written on in read marker most were  and i smudged away the  and got away with it my friend works in the city and we do out reach for unhoused folks ive befriended many and recently the city has done sweeps which destroys peoples property and shelters he is holding a tent drivei got him a few good ones on the cheap
i never went to college so my younger days were filled with your typical run of the mill minimum wage jobs for shifty retailers 

eventually through some luck and gambles i ended up starting a home business that does fairly well i live a modest life but i am secure and comfortable 

my business is seasonal so there is a part of the year where i have a lot of free time 

sometimes during this time i would look for a job to make some side money but my business doesnt carry over well to anything that pays decent and i have a huge gap on my resume aside my self employed stuff

this ment all that was available to me was still those shifty retail jobs 

i actually enjoyed the work when i did it before it was the people that were the problem and of course i ran into that as soon as i would start

the thing is i dont really need to work or have a job this is for recreation basically and my  year self employed on my resume means i can just not list this job in employment history it makes  difference 

so now any time i decide to get a job for fun money i go into it knowing im just going to work there until someone makes it not worth it at which point i rage quit but because i know this going in i usually have been playing fly on the wall long enough to do some damage on my way out 

my last manager liked to use the r word a lot and a bunch of those other things managers like to do that they know they shouldnt but do anyways the store was already on thin ice and there was a much more successful location oddly close by

so the day she pushed me too far i called hr let them know i was disabled and this was causing my mental health to suffer and i needed a leave of absence

 it takes them  days to approve or deny this so during that time they are in limbo as to weather or not they can hire a replacement

i had no intention of returning but i drug it out and even filed for a few extentions meaning a whole investigation was launched into why this was going on im guessing because hey we lost  of the  people who know how to price everything and it will take months to traun a replacement was not something corporate was happy to hear 

long story short that location no longer exists i talked to one of the girls at the other location and apparently it along with the other location that was doing well were both struggling with being short staffed so they just transfered the good employees over there like  people got fired due to the investigation the rest got severance packages and they shut it down
like the title says i snorted a  ball and was horny as can be and sucked off my friends father who is  years older than me
i was camping with my friends and got a slug on a stick i said should i burn him and i put him into the fire my friend then said dont do that its evil and i instantly felt bad 

at first it was more of an intrusive thought but also i suppose i took out some anger too i felt wrath when i was burning the slug and it felt like good stress relief until my friend said that and then i felt guilty instead 

im pretty sure the slug survived as i took him away from the fire and he was still moving but he couldve died from his injuries 

i still feel really bad to be honest and i dont want my friends to see me as a monster and i feel so bad for what i did to the slug 

im sorry slug 

im sorry friends 

i wish i had never done it
i know how it sounds but look money has been so tight lately and i just began dating this girl who has an amazing ass and lately shes been so mad that i havent been paying for anything when we go out i tell her im trying as unlike her i dont have roommates and have car payments but anyway she was going on about how i dont have a hair blowdryer at my place and if i was nice id get her one it just so happens a couple days later i saw this homeless persons cart with a whole bunch of random stuff including two hair blowdryers i decided that theres no way this guy needs two he was around the corner by the drive threw pan handling i just took the nicer blowdryer and hopped in my car and drove away slightly quicker then i would have if i didnt steel a homeless guys blowdryer he didnt see me but a lot of other cars were looking and saw one person laughing at me but i managed to tell my girl i bought her a blow dryer from a second hand shop even though i actually stole it if the guy only had one i might have thought twice but he had two
my mother after i completed high school wanted me to go off to university but at the time i lacked ambition and disappointed by my final high school results with everything that went on in my life at the time i decided to take a gap year as a teenager i really struggled with depression and social anxiety and sometimes would get panic attacks in public so when covid hit it helped as bad as that sounds because i didnt have to socialize as much  
  
the following year i got into university doing a course i didnt want to do but the pressure for my mom especially when she would say she worked so hard to put me through school and did it all for nothing for me to be sitting in her house useless that made me feel so guilty so i went also because of my results i had to do a bridging course for a year which i completed with success so the following year i guess thats where things took a turn  
  
right through high school i would always voice out that i had serious social anxiety and deeply depressed and needed help but always constantly ignored by my family i got to the point where i was suicidal even my teacher noticed there was even a day she took me home because she was worried and spoke to my mom about it but nothing happened so going to university my mental health has just been deuterating  
  
so on my second year at uni things went from online learning to on campus which was so overwhelming i couldnt even focus i was failing i felt like i was going crazy and no one would understand me because i dont even understand myself so i dropped out as in from last year i dont attend my classes i just sit in my dorm room and do nothing when my mom calls to check on me i just say im failing or when she asks for my semester results i just give her excuses or ignore her for which pisses her off rightfully so whenever i need money she sends it whenever she comes to the city she stops by and visits ive gotten so comfortable being in my room all day and feel guilty because overall she really is the best mom who deserves high achieving exceptional and health kids  
  
currently she owes the university  for a useless kid and she doesnt even know it i am taking online courses and i have started my own ecommerce store so hopefully this goes well because i no longer want to be burden or disappointment to her
when i bartended at an olive garden in college wed have the ability to put employee discounts on meals  off

whenever i got tables that paid in cash id discount their bill by  and pocket the cash i made  a week extra from doing this i invested all of this money since i was living with my parents at the time

when i graduated i had more than enough invested to put a huge downpayment on a house which i now live in 

i havent stolen anything since
i have noticed a pattern in my life i have little regard for things like lying about significant things cheating in school and recently filling a water cup with a fountain drink 

the reason i am even writing this is because today i filled a water cup up with a fountain drink which is obviously not allowed i ended up getting caught to which the manager or owner of the joint scolded the worker who gave me the cup i felt bad of course and i payed afterwards because i felt bad for her but the problem is i dont really feel bad that i filled the cup up with a fountain drinkin fact im annoyed that he made such a big fuss since in my mind most people do this  i think he is overreacting even when others might say im the one whos stealing anyway the whole thing just stuck into my mind and i went on thinking about the other areas where i have lacked integrity 

i dont actively cheat on everything in fact i work very hard to get good marks in what im interested in but if its something i hate or suck at i cheat and i guess thats just not moral of me yet behind my consciousness i dont feel bad in that circumstance  because afterall i hate the subject and i am usually required to take it 

i used to also steal from stores when i was a teenager and i remember thinking that there is no reason to feel bad that you should only feel bad if its a person youre stealing from 

 i also have a hard time following rules its not necessarily intentional but i so easily deem many rules are silly that i blatantly stop following them there are countless things i did in addition to this hence the title  and i dont know why i am this way 

my earliest memory is lying in elementary school about selling things from a catalog and getting rubber duck rewards i got caught there too after like a month and had to return this giant keychain of rubber duck i collected lol  it was so embarrassing for me and yet ive never thought to stop my behavior since then i think i want to take shortcuts and do things the easy way which is why many adults have disliked me even to this day as i am in my s
okay first off when did funeral processions stop with the little flags on the cars i grew up immediately able to recognize a funeral procession because there would be a line of cars driving really slowly all with the little orange or black flags following the hearse like you immediately knew and you immediately respected that hey this is part of a funeral dont be a dick 

but no i guess they dont do that anymore or im in the south now and maybe they just dont do that here 

im driving home from work and decided to take this little side route to cut through  exits of traffic then merge back on the highway it usually saves me about  minutes and so its just a habit at this point i turn onto the road thats going to take me back on the highway and i see the car in front of me with hazards on so im immediately like scuuuurp and get over into the passing lane then i see the next car in front of them has their hazards on going really slow and im like well thats weird there must be something in the road so im going a little slower but still going the speed limit i look up the road and just see a loooong line of cars all with hazards on and i dont know why funeral procession didnt cross my mind until im cutting back into the lane  cars behind the hearse to get back on the highway 

i can only imagine what was going through everyones head as i completely disrespectfully zipped through a funeral procession but can we be real here why were there no flags this was a couple days ago and i still feel like a total dick about it
about a week ago i was drinking and driving im happy no one got hurt or killed by my stupid mistake i just hit the curb and just did damage to my car it sure is costing me money i hate it because i barley go out and barley drink as it is i still feel guilty never again my life just sucks too right now ive been working so hard lately trying to build my family out of poverty working  hour shifts  days a week just to make a mistake like this i feel  little depressed too i still live with my kids father who i left a few months ago  im trying to keep the peace by not just throwing him out but he still not out of here then he just lost his job so its not like he can leave without money my life really sucks right now
my grandpa bought a can of chili lime pringles and had told me he didnt really care for the flavor in my thirteen year old brain that translated to you can have the rest of these but i was on some sort of a weight loss journey at the time and ended up just licking the seasoning off of all the chips and stacking them back in the can to come back for later super gross i know so i put the can back in the cupboard with the full intention of eating them the next day well i get home from school the next day and head over to the cupboard for my afternoon snack and to my absolute shock and horror i find the empty can sitting at the top of the trash bag 

me and my grandfather were the only people living in the house at the time im  now and to this day i still havent had the heart to tell him
i have to go into work soon so i dont have much time the other day i had a late paper for class and didnt want it to be any later so i tried to type it out whenever id get to a red light or a stop sign however without noticing i gradually began to keep working on the assignment while i was pulling into the stop signs and red lights and eventually when i realized that i was doing it while driving i completely dropped my phone and drove in silence 

i have a bad habit of looking down at it if something goes wrong with my music or something primarily when im pulling into stops because i guess my brain sees it as less bad pretty much my entire family does the same thing but it feels so wrong at the same time to drive without music and im worried without it id end up making more mistakes in the tedium regardless im glad i learned this at  so i can try to fix it but the fact that im still struggling makes me feel bad is this unforgivable
i m use to do some horriable but funny things when i was  ish  all the housing on the military bases had those old school mail slots on doors  they told you to put a newspaper in to block it cause they dont use em  also the power boxes to the units was outside on a wall with the letter of the unit
a group of us would go checking if the mail slot was openoh boy when we found one one of us would cut the power while the other lit smoke bombs and thru em in the house and at the side door and hauled ass  must have done this to  units   i found it funny back then but not so funny  years later
back in high school i went to a party and got drunk for the first time i hadnt been the party type never got into trouble and wanted to relieve stress before jumping into college at some point i was told that there was a train going on in a room and figured id jump in to finally have sex 

as i went into the room i saw it was just one other guy but in my opinion i thought it was just one at a time in the room or something anyways i go in and we fool around for a bit 



the sex


for context the room was dark so while i know for certain she knew its a different guy coming in im not entirely sure if she saw my face 

what transpired was something that was less than  minutes shes kissing my body but i dont want to kiss back she tries giving me head but keeps biting my dick and she lays down saying to fuck me n

now before i can even get a condom on correctly she says fuck me friends name

this was another black guy who looks nothing like me but who i was with at the party it was then i knew i couldnt continue with this and started to put my pants back on 

right as im putting my belt on her friend comes into the room as shes worried and i leave them alone



the morning

because i was drunk i didnt bother driving and ended up staying the whole night we came across each other in the kitchen and when i asked her about the other night she stated that i did nothing wrong and that she was fine nevertheless ive felt guilty since and feel as if ive sad her regardless  



present day

its been years since and i feel like i need to own up to a crime even though we were both drunk and she told me i did nothing wrong i messaged her on fb summarizing all this and saying she can decide where to go from here im remorseful but still curious as to whether this constitutes sa or not
hear me out yes it was wrong did tell my line managers the truth that i was faking 

started a new job taking over from someone retiring was one on one with them today in the office after several hours of the same old same old how amazing he is at his job no one else does their job properly and watching him one finger type for half an hour was close to tears i ask a question and it creates a torrent of how amazing he is how no one does their job and the information is in the file so learned to smile and nod at them which only works for soo long until a long winded repeat of how amazing he is and how no one else does their jobs  repeated the same information in  varieties of phrases and words acknowledges i know it and then repeats it in another variety of phrases and words and how amazing they are and no one else does their job

have found several mistakes of his but if mention them to him he says its doesnt matter who made the mistakes just sort them out email him about his mistakes and it creates another avenue about something else of how amazing he is and no else does their jobs

started panic running to the loo and hiding in there for  minutes to save my sanity phoned my line managers and they totally understand now counting down the days till the amazing one who is the only one who does his job properly retires then i can actually concentrate on what i was actually employed for
i stole toy dinosaurs in preschool then showed it off to my friends my dino collection i even had the rarest dino the pterodactyl all my friends asked me where i got my dinos and i told them my mom worked for the dino company and she would hook me up with all the latest dinos a few days later my mom found my secret stash of dinosaurs in my lunchbox and made me turn in all of them and say sorry to the teachers later my friends found out what happened and they wouldnt talk to me for a couple of days truly the saddest moment of my life
so i got a job offer recently and after i was offered the job hr required me to give  references to email them a long survey i have never had to give that many references before i think thats ridiculous i didnt even need references for my current position the practice is antiquated i was able to get  references still waiting on one to do the survey i stupidly did the last reference myself under a fake email using the name of a former manager that probably doesnt remember me i was desperate and frustrated but thats no excuse now im probably not going to get this job im sure theyll be able to find out what i did i have no one to blame but myself dont lecture me cause ive already lectured myself


edit  this thread got a lot of comments so i figured id update i did get the job a lot of you said i was overthinking i guess you were right lesson learned next time just go to reddit if i need references 
let me start of by saying that i deeply reget what my action i should have thought more clearly about my actions and shouldnt have done somthing so stupid

the way this situation started of was when i was in the library studying for my exam that are coming up when i started to feel extremely sexually aroused i tried so hard to ignore it distracting myself with my work but this had felt unlike anything else i had ever felt before and it was screwing with my i had looked to my side and there were these girls who looked my age that i found very attractive getting up to leave the library in an act of desparation i had taken out my phone to take a photo of there backsides so that i could go to the bathroom and take care of things unfortunatly i had forgotten to turn off the flash and i think they saw me in the act i felt so embarrased after that instance and went to the bathroom and shamefully took care of the problem in the bathroom


i hate myself for stooping so low and do somthing so henious that i wasnt aware i would be able to do but now im scared im scared that i will begin to crave to do more henious and evil things i feel it already happening



edit greatful for all the comments for both the ones that are trying to be consoling and those who are telling me how it is altough may never fully atone for what i have done the least i can do is change and become a better person
for quick context inow m had pretty difficult childhood large family untreated adhd bullied and targeted by my own siblings my whole childhood emotionally neglected and ostracized knowing what i know now i was clearly in severe need of mental health care and therapy as i clearly had reactive attachment disorder on top of the untreated adhd my siblings locked me in the snow for hours would attack me and harass me and then i would deal with the same things at an extremely small school  students pre k  th even knowing what i know now i still lay in bed some nights so angry and ashamed of myself when i was  i had no control of my anger or emotions and so people avoided me then a group of guys started talking to me one day they pointed out a girl in our class who was known for dating around i dont know how they convinced me but they convinced me to walk over and grab her butt one of them did it first to show me it was okay so i did she laughed it off and told me not to do it again but the guys laughed and told me she was just saying that so i did it again later i dont know if i was looking for their attention or i was just so over sexualized and lonely but it went on for so long it happened so many times and she so clearly wasnt okay with it then one day in weight class the girl i had a crush on let one of the guys touch her breast for god knows what reason so impulsively i reached up and did the same but worst of all there was a group of siblings my parent babysat one of them was not much younger than me but in teen years even a year is considered a long time one day we were swimming and i was tossing them around the pool and wrestling and i realized i was getting excited i took advantage of the wrestling it was never under clothes and it never went past touching but to me that doesnt make it any less awful that i would do that i just lay here some nights and these intrusive thoughts pop up like remember that time you just did these things to these girls and i get so angry i pray that she never realized i did that and that i didnt scar her because i was such an awful person but even still anytime i feel like im doing good and ive overcome my past these memories haunt me and tear me back down


edit for clarifications sake and accountability 
    so for starters i think the main feedback i am seeing are the  comments about my adhd other disorders and the story of the guys my intent was not to try and use those as fluff or a crutch i over communicate and have had posts on other subreddits taken down for being too long so i didnt want that to happen and i obviously didnt explain my own perceptions to things properly 
    my mental health issues are not my fault but they are my responsibility the choices i made to assault these girls was still a choice i made to chase my own lustful desires and satisfaction with no consideration of them the other guys encouraged me the st time it happened and with one girl they did not play any part in it from then on except as witnesses and played no part in the other two girls i victimized i think my state of mind was looking to it as a road map two things can be true at once first that my life was difficult and thus there were many of maslows hierarchy of needs that i did not recieve second that it does not excuse my behavior or justify it in anyway but in my studies of psychology ive come across a common thread of seeking the purpose behind the behavior so i guess my quick typing without context came off as justifying but that was not my intent nor my feelings on the matter  

nd i want to apologize for not having the foresight to place a trigger warning for anyone else who has been victimized in the past or effected by actions such as this it does not bring me any comfort to see other posts about how common this is my hope for this post was not to hear other horror stories about this being a normal male behavior i have been in therapy a few different times however the times i have gone into therapy has felt directionless even still therapist are trained to be unjudgmental to remain impartial and unmoved i posted this to get real true responses so thank you 

to those who have offered words of support and understanding thank you for showing me that there are people out there who will understand that i strive everyday to get as far away from the person i was as i can that i am not that person anymore and never will be again this was what i needed to know that others could see past who i was and understand that i despise who i was that i could still be seen as a person by real people and not just a therapist in a chair being paid to convince me i am a person 

to those who were critical and correcting thank you i learned a while back the value of criticism having real people provide insight into these things helps to identify blind spots and mistakes

to those who were raw i appreciate your feedback i understand theres nothing i can ever do to make it right i cant take away the things that i did regardless of age or circumstances i am not seeking any forgiveness or get out of jail free card i am not try to manipulate people to coddle me or tell me what i did wasnt a big deal or normal i recognized my failures my desire to be a better person is not dependent on anyones forgiveness of any mistakes ive made past present or future i want to be better because i recognized how horrible and disgusting the things i did was and how much hurt and trauma i could have and as others pointed out likely did cause if someone is truly remorseful they will change with or without forgiveness or acceptance because it whats right i can promise you that i will never be that person again and i will continue doing everything i can to advocate against these behaviors
okay it sounds worse than it is but i havent told anyone this and need to get it out when i first moved in with my bf i was using his truck for awhile i went to the store to get groceries while he was at work so i could cook dinner later that night and while parking i backed into someone it was a newer truck that was a little bigger than my bfs but luckily it was just a little tap obviously enough to feel it but it didnt damage anything on my bfs truck or the other persons truck and the other person wasnt around so i just sat in the drivers seat shaking for a good ten minutes and then went into the store like nothing happened still think about it anytime i park
very silly story incoming my friends mom was supposed to pick me up from school at  but she didnt remember to set an alarm she leaves without me and im left alone at my school about an hour passes and im starting to get hungry nobody else was on campus at the time so i decided to wander for a bit i saw a vending machine but i didnt have any money so i tried reaching under the opening with no success it was about  at that point and i was really starting to get hungry i walked back to the parking lot to see if i could squeeze through a fence leading to the football field i knew there were bathrooms near there so i was relieved when i made it through a gap in the fence the only restroom that was unlocked was the womens restroom which felt wrong at the time but i had to go once i was done with that i looked everywhere for an idea of where to go to get something to eat i found a small building with garagelike door on the outside so i tried opening them i somehow pried one door open with a bit of a struggle and threw my backpack in so i could squeeze through i didnt truly know where i was but once i was inside i asked for help just incase if anyone was in there i wouldnt look as suspicious crawling through a window nobody was in there so i looked around and saw sodas and candies all around me i was very happy i remember voraciously stuffing my backpack with sodas labeled for pom or something like that im ashamed to admit that i crammed as much soda into my backpack as humanly possible and when i was done with that i started feasting in the dark room like that gif of the mouse eating the mm eventually im satisfied with my haul and i make my way out the same way i came in i squeeze back through the gap in the fence and walk back to campus its about pm now and football practice had started i got spotted by some kind dad and he let me use his phone to call my mom and tell her i was still at school she got to my school as soon as she was done talking to her client and she picked me up 

im sorry if this was long i didnt really realize

also two things
 i didnt yet have a phone so i couldnt call anyone
it was way too far to walk home because we lived about  miles away and i didnt know where to go
when i was  my cousins and i decided to make a bonfire at the pond near my house for no reason being the stupid kids that we were the surrounding dead grass  weeds quickly caught flame and the whole field by said pond starting burning out i tried to pee on the engulfing flames but its pretty hard to go when youre extremely anxious by an ongoing fire with pedestrians headed your way my cousins and i decided to run away and by some luck we never got caught walked back over the next day and  acres of land was burnt to dust
i worked at a steakhouse and someone left a pair of sick oakleys we left them in the lost and found for a week and no one returned to get them so i snagged them for my boyfriend  days later the guy came in looking for them i pretended to look and even went to check the managers office i still feel bad snout it to this day
this was a few days ago me and my  friends clyde and preston egg this one really nice girls house i feel really bad now and i have no idea what to do
trigger warning mention of self harm and anorexia my name is lucas i am  years old and i am in my sophmore year of highschool and about a year ago i was the most negative person to be around and i manipulated anyone whenever i got the chance i would make up lies about myself to get sympathy and attention and i did it so much to the point where wondering if i was gonna be alive the next day ive always remembered those times and i would convince myself i was in the right but i was hurting so many of my friends i have apologized personally to every single person and i am met with the cold shoulder and i deserve it after what i have done to them for the past couple years they should forget everything about me and move on as should i i have been improving myself lately physically and mentally and i started to work out and have different hobbies  i am a better person then i was this time last year but my past lingers over me and today when i apologized i wasnt met with any forgiveness i went into it not wanting any but a part of me wants some conclusion something to tell me that its all over and everyone is okay now but i havent gotten it and dont know if i ever will the things i have lied about are 
having an eating disorder 
 being physically abused by parents
 being diagnosed with a life threatening disease
 me being good at certain things
 me being bilingual 

those are the ones that i can think of right now i just want someone to just say something that lets me know its all over
when i was a tween like say  years old i lived in the fourth floor of a musty apartment a lot of people had doormats despite their being a carpet in the hallways of the apartments anyway i thought to myself one day hey what if i just switched the doormats around   
so i did i just grabbed two neighbors doormats and swapped places with eachother to fuck with them and i kept doing it   
after they put their doormats back i took them and swapped them around with other peoples doormats sometimes i would take their doormat and place it in front of some random spot in the hallway not even in front of a door or i would hide it in the stairwell  
i kind of regret that because one of the poor victims was a neighbor of mine that i like and also because its kind of just stupid i would be a little bit confused if my doormat kept switching places or disappearing especially because those things are just overly expensive for no reason  
also because i would do that and not even wash my hands afterwards like yeah good going  year old me put your grubby hands on a surface that has been stepped on by a hundred dirty muddy shoes and then not wash your hands afterwards  
oh well
i was at a metal show last weekend during the set of the headlining act i spent the majority of my time towards the front of the crowd near but not next to the stage at certain moments i felt compelled to mosh as i was able to really express alot of internal rage 

a friend passed back in december some of the bands songs reminded me of him the sadness turned to anger after a few moments of choking back tears and i just let it rip 

the reason i feel guilty is because i was too much a coward to make my way back to where the pit was already in motion so i may have sullied the night for a number of individuals i definitely dont like being that guy
flys are not the brightest insects i used to live in a house with a lot of big windows that flys would mistake for openings to escape outside instead of escaping they were met with me as a young child that used to capture them alive in my hands i would then pull off their wings while they were still alive and throw the fly and the wings into the bin alive some would crawl out others would give up and accept their fate absolutely psychotic behaviour if you ask me now i completely understand if you think im a sadist i am however now a reformed human i am a vegetarian and an animal lover you could say i wouldnt hurt a fly
across my  years at university i worked as a waiter at a chain of restaurants the owner was an asshole and only kept me because i was willing to work late shifts he had a reputation for sexually harassing employees 

everyday i would mess with a few cash transactions and pocket the difference 

for example if a customers bill was  i would take  from the customer and then remove a few items which reduces the bills total the new total would be  and as far as the pos system was aware the  bill was successfully closed with  in cash i pocketed the  difference 

i did this a few times a day  days a week i would pocket approx  a month which adds up over  years because i cashed up i was able to ensure there was no suspicious transactions or issues 

i was never caught on camera as the till was above a shelf where we kept personal belongings this meant it was easy to leave the money around and then stash it into my bag or jacket across the day 

if i ever did get caught my plan was to blackmail my manager as i had evidence of his sexual harassment in the form of whatsapp message screenshots sent to me from female colleagues i would threaten to tell his wife too 

fyi i was not stealing from the customer they were always charged correctly i stole from the restaurant in fact i would give customers insane discounts if they were decent with me
when i m was in my twenties i worked in a nightclub and used to walk home with a couple of coworkers pretty much every night at roughly am on the way home there was this one garden that was always perfect it had a little pond with a gnome one of those that has a fishing pole you know the type right well one night we decided it would be fun to move said gnome to a neighbors garden no damage we were not heathens lol

the next night said gnome was back in its place as if nothing had happened so of course we moved it again to a different neighbors garden and we continued to do this every time we walked home normally at least  or  times a week for the next  months or so i hope we didnt annoy you too much and you took it in the spirit it was meant it always made us smile to see him back in his original place

edit  thank you guys n gals the responses have made me smile so much im really glad that there is still room for this sort of prank in the world i like to think that the owner had kidsgrandkids that always wanted to hear about the travels of the magical gnome
i didnt tell anyone this the amount of guilt shame and fear overcame my tiny body when it happened and i refused to ever tell a soul 

you knew me from the first year in kindergarten we instantly became best friends you were just as insane and uncontrollable as me we had so many things in common it was as if we were brother and sister we went to each others birthday parties  and would have that one absolute obsession spiderman everything had to be spiderman themed for us backpacks lunchboxes drinking bottles everything

until the day you announced on the playground that you had this new spiderman action figure since we couldnt be in the hallways by ourselves and everybodys backpack was there you could only invite your  closest friends to sneak into the hallway and show them your brand new spiderman figurine 

everybody was amazed the adrenaline from being somewhere we shouldnt have been combined with the excitement of seeing you sneak out your toy out of your backpack was way too much for  year olds you showed it so proudly you showed how it could circle its arms and legs almost  in every way we were impressed but than those malicious thoughts came up when you said we couldnt touch it you didnt trust us your closest friends you couldnt and rightfully so i wouldnt want to take any chance either of someone potentially breaking my beloved toy 

so when you and the  others who came with you decided to get in a random classroom to feed your curiosity i decided to feed mine 

your backpack stood there shining and whispering to me to open it and as i did there he was tobey maguires peter parker laying loosely on your peter parker lunchbox 

the immense power took over me and with a beastly lust i carefully took him out of his prison and had to know how you felt when you almost spun his armes and legs around  

almost as i repeat cause i felt the figurine internally scream from misery the limbs felt loose all of the sudden and when i saw the little bits of plastic coming from it i panicked i felt my blood draw away from my face and could hear you coming back with your other friends 

i put peter back into your backpack right on your lunchbox and made it look like his limbs were still attached to its body i didnt wanted to make it look like i did it so i ran to the other door before you and the others could see me 

the only thing i remembered was your saddened voice when you discovered that your beloved toy was broken you never suspected my selfish persona and blamed it on your poor self the immense feel of guilt shame and fear made me become a bad liar and a goody  shoes 

i am so sorry for breaking your spiderman figurine killian
i was  or  dont remember much we used to collect old tires from this dumpster and play with them when we get bored we go the highest point on the side of the road and let them go this side has some trees and at the end this m wall  with a sidewalk that sperates it from the road some tires manage to jump and some dont make it we never once managed to hit any cars

one day i was alone it was around  pm nobody was outside so i decided to throw this tire im playing with i went to the side of the road i remember i couldnt threw it cause it was heavy so i just let it slide it gained momonetum and jumped to the road straight into a maruti with force and another car that was behind the maruti stopped and was hit from behind by another car dont remember if it lost balance but the maruti that was first crashed in the road divider and everything went to shit i was shaking decided to run away and hid on top of a tree far from that location dont remember for how long then i went home and was lucky nobody saw me i never told anyone and to this day i feel very guilty

edit  if anyone would wonder why would i even do this seeing cars evading tires made me laugh hysterically like laugh non stop even lying on the ground out loud now i feel very guilty whenever i remember it
i dont know why i did it already in the process of signing up for therapy i moved back in with my parents this past year since i could not find work in my field in my city after months of daily job searching

i was drunk the other afternoon and took a  bill from my mothers wallet i remember being so confident about it i spent it on gas to go for a drivewhile sober i was so full of guilt the next day and replaced it but i dont know wtf came over me ive never intentionally stolen from anything but stores before from a bad depression and cry for attention when i was a teenager but no one even ever found out it was one tube top and a couple makeup pencils over the course of years

going to talk about with my therapist once i can get my insurance reapproved but i am currently so disgusted with myself i needed to vent
so i love roblox let me get that straight ive played for over  years and only first got robux around  years ago i got it from my friend who wanted me to have some good its free ill take it a few years go by and i buy a gift card when i have the chance but my sister offered me a  dollar gift card if i buy her a  dollar gift card so i did a week or so later a few days ago at the time of posting i ask her if she wants more robux i say give me  and i will she does she says this time i can have the  one and i go to the store buy the cards and get home then i used both the cards to buy this item i lied and told her it mustve fallen out of my pocket on the way home i rode my bike and she believed it and hasnt mentioned it since i feel bad for doing this
for the last while i have been lying to my parents about how many university classes i have been taking

some context before i tell the story i am the disappointment child for years i have been living in my brothers shadow my older brother  years older is extremely gifted and is really good at sports school people i am not thats not to say i am not smart i still get like b a grades but my brother was the kid to get like  he has been in several relationships i have only been in one they take anytime to sing his praises and almost never do the same for me you get the point so my stricter parent have always favored him even though they wont admit it any time i try to bring it up they shut me down saying the we love both our children equally 

story time i have recently entered university in a pretty difficult course civil engineering because i have a job and am doing a hard uni course i decided to drop  of my  classes so when it came time to tell my parents i sent them a email explaining but somehow i dont understand how they thought i was adding two courses instead of dropping them so the next day they called me up  congratulating and praising me they almost never have done this with me this is a rare time i feel like they are proud of me i really enjoy the feeling of my parents actually being proud of me and i dont want to go back to being a disappointment so ive been lying to them for the last month they have thought i was taking  classes instead of the  im actually taking and because my parents are a bit controlling even thought i no longer live with them they still want updates on how im doing  i feel bad for lying to them

my old company essentially collapsed no one i knew when i was a remote contractor there is currently employed its basically a shell of a workplace and has been for several months 

i recently found the box with my work laptop in my home i was supposed to have sent it back to them after my contract ended and the company hadnt hired me as staff  my bad i honestly thought i had and i just completely forgot i had also gotten quite sick around that time and so it slipped my mind and was moved around by my mom who had come to help me recover

the address on the prepaid package to send the laptop isempty no one works in that building anymore so i just reset it to factory settings and going to use it as a personal laptop

edit to add thanks all times are tough and im slowly becoming ok with sticking it to the new owner of the company who gutted it now its a matter of actually figuring out how to properly reset it

its a macbook and i erased it but its still asking for the evil corporate overlords login info 
this happened a few months ago it was late at night and i was walking from my friends house theres a usual route i take which is always very quiet
as i was walking down the road i saw a couple at the corner the girl was crying because her boyfriend i presume was beating her badly i dont know what i was thinking but it just sent chills down my spine and i justran away it wasnt until  mins later i realised what i could have done
 please note i am a very thin guy and have no strength so i really had no chance of getting into a fight
i didnt have the guts to walk back and was just terrified

i keep thinking about it almost everyday i hope she is fine

the worst is that the problems aint about being compulsory or abusive about it the problem was that i was dealing in college and my sister knew about and told all my family and i needed to go to familiar therapy and such to work things with my family i quitted the bad ones like coke and now im in majority smoking pot and my family doesnt even imagine that i still smoke weed and have a girlfriend that also does that one day maybe i will get caught again
f 

this is something i never told my friend family or boyfriend i never verbalized this or even wrote it down before but its killing me inside

i live in a european country a normal bachelors degree takes  semesters  years its free besides administration fees you pay quarterly and i havent paid the fees for the next semester and am about to get kicked out let me start at the beginning

when it came to getting into a course i didnt get into anything i wanted because my grades were that terrible its actually a secret in itself because everyone assumed my grades were top because i dont belong to the dump kind i guess i was always a child prodigy
got into school two years earlier than normal and skipped a class but by the time i became a teenager i was deeply depressed and had a lot of social anxiety to the point that simple interactions were too much to handle for me i would never go to school and it reflected in my grades they werent bad but they also aint that good either i actually had to redo my final year my teenage self didnt have many options so she picked the most random subject that didnt require numerous clauses and ended up in experimental physics

i would have walked out the first day if i didnt meet some of my school friends we became study buddies and everything went fine until my depressions kicked in i got put into a psychiatric ward for half a year and once i got back they moved on and i didnt pass one exam it had been over  years ago and i never bounced back i start feeling big imposter syndrome and start telling myself that im not smart enough to do that the fact that we were only  girls at the beginning and the others had already dipped out didnt help my case because it left me isolated and with some weird kind of pride that i needed to make it in this man dominated field sexism within nerd groups exists its a real thing they mocked me and told me i should go back to do something with kids like normal women do i was quite female presenting with mini skirts and nails and they had a lot to say about that

i got even more depressed what made it impossible for me to get out the bed but then the pandemic hit i know its inappropriate to say that but it was a blessing in disguise i didnt have to leave my bed to go to university and study furthermore i could do right that and be alright but my imposter syndrome kicked in again i have zero confidence in myself when the exam season came around i had so much anxiety that i never went or wrote one its not that i dont get it im simply too scared to fail and prove everyone right


atp i didnt want to study anymore but everyone around me was so proud and told everyone that im gonna be in physics im a desi and its quite important in our culture to not embarrass your family and to not be a bad example for everyone who comes after you academics were really important in our house and saving your face too i didnt want to make people talk and call me stupid its enough if i do it all the time and my classmates too but everyone starts to notice and asking me why im still on my bachelors degree so i started to lie that im in my masters what put me into way more complicated situations


im not stupid i know that im became so depressed that life doesnt function anymore and if anyone is wondering why i dont get help i do i have weekly therapy sessions for years but every time i climb out of the darkness something hits me and i fall back im actually quite endangered because of everything you know what i mean i started to have the mentality that i rather drop die than explaining anything to anyone not only that but im too deep into this lie i cant back out and tell people the truth 

i wouldnt go to my courses because i was embarrassed that im still sitting in all of them with these yearold and having the professors looking at me in disgust is something that i cant handle in general they didnt like me in the first place because im an immigrant didnt do my best wasnt smart enough to understand mathematics like that and what i felt the most because im a woman and in a field that is not conventionally picked by women 

 since i was a child i always wanted to end up in science or ingenuity i wanted to inspire little girls to follow their interests like i had at the beginning its prolly quite barbie but i always wanted to tell the girls that everything is possible and that you shouldnt be limited by gender expectation that had been put on you i always lived my life like that from climbing up the trees with the boys to playing american football all my teenage years its not that i thought that im something special or not like the other girls because i am i developed at a very young age my understanding of feminism it has evolved since then but i could have never accepted to be defeated by a guys field and on a different note by myself

anyways my confession is that i never got one credit point in my  years of being in university

edit i dont want sympathy or sum im completely aware of the fact that my personal actions or lack of got me into this situation i just wanted to get it off my chest just once just tell someone because it has been nearly  years and i couldnt tell anyone not even my therapist
so i was day drinking in celebration of the first day back to school uni and went to take a piss in an alley i had just got off the bus on my way home and couldnt hold it anymore i was turned around with my back facing the alley when a teenager turns the corner on their phone they do this just as the piss starts coming out so rather than put it back in my pants and get piss all over myself my drunk ass panicked pulled out my phone with my free hand and pretended to be texting i dont think they even noticed i was there but ive never been so mortified in my life the one time im desperate enough to not wait until im safely at home to relieve myself and of course something like this happens im so embarrassed with myself
honestly its stupid i even feel a compulsion to confess since it was just a  sashay of soup powder from the supermarket but my religious upbringing makes this seem extremally rebellious to me and i feel drunk with power 

im in my s and was honestly embarrassed by the fact id never shoplifted before even my parents the religious ones who instilled these values in me made fun of me for being a pussy when they found out id made it through high school without even pocketing candy i literally bought over  worth of other stuff at the supermarket and was at the selfcheckout staring into my bad with this crumpled up plastic wrapped soup for one powder thinking this is the moment of truth if i pull this sashay out of my bag ill have to pay for it and if i dont ill be a criminal

its been  months now and i still havent eaten the soup that soup isnt mine i didnt earn it eating it would be admitting guilt to my crimes eating it would be tampering with evidence which is an even bigger crime itll just have to sit in my pantry until the day i die
so basically when me and my sister were younger we had a very old babysitter i hated her with the life of me 
when i got older and got a job i was able to get a phone and i put a food delivery app on it i had put in my own credentials at first but sooner rather than later my babysitter asked me to put in her credentials as well so she could pay once in a while well i soon learned that i had accidentally permanently saved her card into my account so i slowly began using her card once in a while to get my sister and i food without her knowledge our mom knows we did it once because i felt guilty and needed to spill the beans to someone
my mom never told her because we knew she had stolen from our home a couple times some worth a good chunk of money like various groceries she even stole cutlery a few times 
i used to feel bad but eventually it just became a habit so i dont even care anymore mostly because they broke our clothing dryer and my mom had to pay  for a brand new one 

so thats my confession i may be a kleptomaniac but i think she deserves it
i worked as a bar manager for over ten years i stole from my different workplaces for many years by shrinking the till the stolen money would then be used to buy useless shit that i didnt need it became something i had mad anxiety and guilt about all the time but i couldnt stop myself i also accrued a bad drinking habit a deathly spiral of doom when i was eventually let go for starting a fight drunk it was nearly a godsend taking into consideration the consequences if i had been caught stealing the guilt and shame will follow me forever i am completely sober since and do not steal and have a quick conversation everyday with whoever is up there to try and be a better man
so back when i was  i had my learners and my girlfriend at the time asked me to go pick her something up from the store  it was later at night around pm and i headed out  i hadnt been to this place often to my bearings were off as to whether it was on the left or the right side of the road

now the road is two lane both directions  i was on the inside left lane  i was looking for the store when i noticed it at the last second  i swerved my car over at the last minute to get into the right lane and make a turn into the store when suddenly the front end of my car slammed into a darker coloured car in the right lane  i never noticed them  i wasnt paying attention  i put on my four ways and pulled behind him  just then he entered into a parking lot probably to exchange information ill never know  now the parking lot is set up so the entrance and exit are not the same so youd have to drive around the lot in order to exit

as soon as he pulled into the lot a voice in my head just said go  i slammed on the gas while he was still pulling in and floored it down the street  i got to a residential area and went even further into it before shutting off my car and the lights and sat there in silence  i thought to myself what have i done  i had just turned a fender bender into a hit and run and i just fled the scene  i tried to figure out what to do  do i go back or do i leave  being an idiotic  year old i fled completely  i knew i was screwed if i went back and id probably lose my license and if i didnt insurance would be so high i may as well have lost it

i went home and switched the story around and told my parents how i was the one who was hit and the other driver did a hit and run and fled the scene  my girlfriends dad had a friend who was a mechanic  he buffed off the other paint and fixed my bumper with zip ties he offered to get me the parts cheap but i was paranoid that theyd be able to trace the parts back to me so i declined

i never filed an accident report but told my parent i did  shortly after this i got rid of the car and bought another used car from my moms friend   i wanted it to never be traced back to me  i took it to the junk yard myself to make sure it would be destroyed

no one ever found out what i did  ive never said anything to anyone  this happened  years ago and i still feel immense guilt from it  i can imagine how much of a pain insurance must have been for that person but i was a terrified novice driver

whoevers car i hit in october  sorry i fled the scene i hope it wasnt too much of a headache for you to deal with everything
when i  f was  and in my freshman year of high school i went to a party at my friends house where we all were drinking in the morning as my friends and i were retelling what we remembered from the night this boy who ill call h for story purposes who was  and in th grade at the time tells me that at one point of the night he woke up and my tongue was in his mouth i was shocked to hear this as i didnt have any memory of making out with a sleeping person but my memory from the night is blurry considering the alcohol what i do remember is making out with a different boy t m at the time in a dark room in my friends basement at one point of the night this was fully consensual i have a vague memory of kissing who i thought was t at one point and him not kissing back and feeling rejectedconfused by this i honestly have no idea what i did in response to this but im pretty sure i just stopped kissing him around six months after that incident one of hs friends m at the time commented that i r ped h under one of my friends instagram pictures of usboth immediately after and years later i would ruminate about the incident all the time wonder if it really happenedthe severity if i had traumatized h for his entire life i would try to remember the incident but come up blank  years after the incident i reached out to h to get some clarity and apologize he said that from what he remembers of the night we were in a dark room and he was high and tired and i seemed pretty drunk and i kissed him he said that he was young and kind of scaredconfused by it bc he hadnt had experience kissing girls before but that he never saw it as that big of a deal since it was just a kiss i apologized and explained that i think what happened was that i mistook him for t in that dark room

i dont know what to do  this haunts me everyday and i spend hours ruminating about it i feel like i should be in jail or de ad i have a good job and friends none of which i feel like i deserve people tell me its okay because this incident was most likely an accident but since i cant remember this i really have no way to prove if it was an accident or not
i have absolutely no idea what it wrong with me im so ashamed to post this and im starting to hate myself even more because of this this was my last resort as i genuinely do not know how to stop i wasnt sure where to post this but im sure it has something to do with my depression anxiety adhd or low self esteem or all of them i really do not know

i am going to be completely honest this whole post no lies

ever since late  when i moved into my new neighborhood i started to steal from cornerstore it wasnt that often for a while and it would usually be a candy bar or something stupid even now the last time i stole from a cornerstore was probably a week ago im guessing in early  i began to start stealing mary jane from my mom after my siblings introduced it to me a month or so before i dont know if im allowed to say it or not but im just gonna call it w i still to this day do not know why i do it but being honest i have not taken anything from her in  weeks im also guessing i know thats absolutely fucking awful and i agree as ive already wroten out a long oath saying im going to try my absolute hardest not to i know this is also awful it wasnt long before i started to steal my sisters too sometimes i just beg mysef that they will get a box with a lock on it to stop my dumbass from taking it why because i genuinely do not know why i do i got so hooked on it and now im finally starting to control myself and making a decision to either get it from friends or someone else i have stolen money multiple times too from most of my family and i had one of their cards on my phone which i recently deleted all traces of it from my phone
i recently got caught lying with my best friend after it cooled down she started telling me how i lie a lot how ill lie to peoples face and act stupid how ive taken her w a couple times and lie about it to her face which it true she said she didnt care and still wanted to be my friend i kept telling her she could leave if she wanted which doing that alone made me feel like a guilt tripper the whole wntire co versation made me feel like a guilt tripper because i wouldnt stop cryng ive alwyas been so sensitive its insane i kept telling her i dont care if she leaves  which was a complete lie because im too attached to her because no one else wants to hang out with me like she does and without her i cry a lot because my life is so boring and depressing when im alone
 i often think im guilt tripping people but thinking im guilt tripping peopel makes me feel like a guilt tripper thinking that and it turns into a loop 
ive caused so many fights so many problems in my house when my sister would go around asking who took it and i would lie and she would start getting mad at everyone and would eventually get yelled at by my parents which i can not fathom how bad i ceel for her and the fact its all my fault too makes it even worse
i dont like liars most of the time no one likes liars even liars i dont want to be known as a guilt tripper as a thief as a selfish person this isnt me and i dont want it to be i just dont know how to stop

people who lie pathologically may want others to view them positively making things up to make them look better their desire to create a false sense of self could indicate that they are unhappy with themselves

i found this in a random article but i feel like it explained me because i am unhappy with myself

i am admitting i have a problem i have a problem with guilt tripping i have a problem with lying and i have a problem with stealing i want to get help and im admitting i need help my next therapy session im going to bring this up to her

i know some poeple are gonna be saying that a lot fo this could get me in illegal trouble which ive been thinking about forver which is one of the reason im trying to stop

i dont think i could have said any of this in real life especially to my sister or mother i guess its easier when your telling a bunch of strangers

edit some people are saying im showing signs of being a manipulative and selfish person or i feel bad for myself instead of others and im trying to get people to feel abd for me a little more background since this story was rushed through a  year period  most of the time i try to shut myself out as much as possible ive always been the most sensitive person ever since i was a kid so most of the time ill easily cry if someone raises their voice at me or something like that i hate bringing attention on myself and whenever my brother or someone else defends me i feel like the shittiest person and i get this depressed feeling in my body getting attention doesnt bring me joy or satisfaction  of the time reading all these comments now have me thinking that im not even aware of my actions and what i really wnat people to think about me and now im scared because i want to be in control of my thoughts and decisions
one time i had cooked and after my parents made cookies i didnt know they were making cookies and i thought i forgot to turn the oven off i turned it off turns out that i turned it off at   the perfect time the cookies were delicious even after  hours in the oven my mom thinks that it was because she set a timer on them
whenever i was a child my aunt lived with me and my family my parents were very strict and had designated eating times  me and my sister were hungry sometimes when it wasnt time to eat we always seen my aunt come home with groceries she would put them in her bedroom so when me and my sister got hungry we would go steal all her snacks from her  we would hide them in our room and eat them when we were hungry 
think i was  got a bunch of raw eggs went to a car park in busy part of town and threw them at the wall then ran away
i needed new tags for my car and ive never gone to the dmv by myself before i assumed i could get a ticket at a kiosk or something but there were none i went to the tellers to ask them how i would get a ticket to queue in line and walked up to a worker who was closest to me simultaneously she had called a ticket number and as i was standing in front of her she assumed i was next she asked me what i needed help with so i told her and she did my tags in only  minutes and i was out i didnt actually realize what had happened until i turned around and the actual person who was next was standing right behind me i felt bad but it was also really freakn cool that i just discovered this new hack glad at least that i could be the first person to say they had a delightful dmv experience
i would go get my lunch as usual and when i got to the register you would tell the lunch lady to add items to the balance such as drinks ice cream hot pretzels etc that werent at the main lunch line and then youd get them or theyd give them to you i would let them know at the start that i wanted a drink as well and id get a drink from the fridge behind them one day i mustve forgot to tell them to add a drink to the balance but i still went and got a drink anyway because i thought i told them i realized later on that they didnt care at all if you took a drink without telling them to add it because the fridge was behind them and they couldnt see it so i just did this and got free drinks every single time all  years of middle school and they never noticed i didnt try this with other items such as ice cream because the cooler was right in front of them so they could see if someone was stealing from it
so yes exactly like the title said   
it started small like maybe around when im around  years old i stole a little bit of money from my parents drawer which is the place where they tend to keep their stack of money my parents were not too tech savvy so they tend to use cash and kept their money in a small vault or locked drawer i stole like around  bucks and kept it for lunch money my parents always give me lunch money but sometimes they forget and im too scared to ask money from my parents this was due to our financial situation at the time so every talk regarding money was like walking in land mines anyway so over the years our financial situation got pretty decent and it was easier to ask for pocket money so i stopped stealing money until i started college   
i attended an overseas university at first things were great until i started failing my classes my grades went from  gpa to  and  and over the semester it just kept going down i was struggling to maintain my studies and i was confused as to why i could not even get the words in and  i started to play mobile games as a way to relieve my stress the game im playing was genshin impact  yes i know don attack me pls blame my friend for forcing me to play this game with them at first it does help with maintaining my stress but then i began to develop you guessed it gacha addiction for those who are unfamiliar with the term it is basically gambling the game has a system where you can get rare limited characters with great fighting abilities and designs by rolling for them however you dont necessarily guarantee to get them every time hence thats where the gambling comes in in order for you to get guarantee to get the character you have to pay real money the game doesnt forced you to pay money as long as you kept playing the missions daily but i began to irresponsibly spend the money my parents send me for my rent and everyday necessities on it i was addicted to the euphoria of getting the characters and collecting them it was a distraction tactic to make me forget about my problems   


i began to lie to my parents to get them to send more money to me and even forged various documents and events like oh my university was doing a seminar can you send me  cus the entrance fee was expensive cus its a three day seminar  oh i need to renew my student visa they need around  for me to pay for everything oh the document of proof here it is i even resort to forged my bank statements before i emailed it to them   


and it continues on even when i have to return back to my country due to covid everyday i stole around  more or less depending on how much i can get from their cash drawer i lost count of how much ive stolen from them till this day they never questioned why i spend so much money they only told me that all these money is an investment for my future and its the parents responsibility to help their children because they thought i spend it on my studies  


i was haunted with guilt and began hearing voices screaming how i am such a scornful child worthless and disgusting i even contemplate to jump off my apartment because i couldnt handle being the person i am this also contributes even worse to my addiction and ever failing grades i couldnt stop and kept stealing at some point i did try to stopped playing the game however my compulsive spending is still there i ended up using the money on something else like buying expensive food buying expensive skincare purchasing random things on online shopping websites yesterday i downloaded genshin again and spent even more on it   


i finally visited a therapist because my university called me due to my failing grades and advised me to get professional help however till this day i never told my parents about what i did   


mom dad im so sorry   

i recently hit a car and made a minor scratch thats somewhat noticeable kinda hard to see if the sun isnt shining and its been a day and the person still hasnt realized idk what to do should i just fess up before its too late and im fucked or do i just wait it out and see what happens im a minor and it was in my schools parking lot there are definitely cameras the only reason im scared is case it was a small but deep scratch and could cost quiet a bit and my dad just bought me a  car battery i know whats the right thing to do i just dont know if the scratch is so bad i need insurance involved i plan on getting a job and paying the girl for the scratch
so this story takes place around  years ago i was in nd year of secondary school junior high to american readers around  years old

 i participated in cross country running annually not out of passion but to miss a day of school and get pocket money for the shop after buying loose rollies off my brothers friend  the event was held every year at the same cross country grounds about a  minute bus from my school 

the big day arrives im wearing essential running clothes full tracksuit puffy superdry jacket yes these were trendy back then and my trusty air max s that would slide through mud had i actually of attempted the race the day is wet cold and miserable i decide on the way there the last thing i want to be doing is running  kilometres in this horrific weather then waiting for everyone else to finish then sitting on a stuffy muddy bus shivering till i get home no thanks i had ran this course before  and knew it was  laps of a loop with a large forestrybushy area in the centre the race starts i set off at a sprint so i dont alert my teacher to any potential fuckery run about  metres down the track check over my shoulder no steward watching so i proceed to hit the smoothest swan dive ever attempted straight into this busheveryone else thought i slipped and joined back after lol  got extremely wet cold and muddy but was it worth it every day of the week i gleefully watched everyone else my friends included suffer through the remainder of the race while i chilled thinking i was lord muck smoking a rollie in the forest 

the only crack in my plan was i failed to realise these were the leinster final qualifiers stateprovince so i wait for the first group to come around and slink my way craftily into the back i run about  metres to the finish line looking like i had just ran the course due to my poor fitness muddy clothes and not being able to run more then  meters without dying my pe teacher is ecstatic congratulating me on qualifying for leinsters i can still hear him saying and doing it in that big jacket aswell i had to hide my shock in the moment but i played it off all the while feeling incredibly bad for my teacher who had no idea of my abilities the realisation of running an actual track in front of a huge crowd in leinster finals finally dawned on me and i proceeded to tear my hamstring playing with my dog days later yes the same dog eating everyones homework 

the memory came to me today as i visited the place in which the course is located i had to smile to myself upon remembering and mr upton if your ever out there reading this my apologies 
in my house my mother did not buy us bread and since we were little we liked to eat it a lot so the neighbor was dedicated to selling bread he had a small business so i went into his house when he was not there and stole many breads the first time i did it i was very scared i climbed through the door and there was a crack and i went in there i uncovered the box of breads and grabbed what i could and i left through the same place the second time i invited my sister more minor to help me steal more loaves i told her and she did not want to but i convinced her i told her that she was not going to go into the house only me and she were going to wait for the loaves from outside and we did so that time we took out a lot of loaves and we were very happy but we never realized that there were traces on the floor because it was dirt and it was wet so the neighbors went to ask my mom if she didnt know who was stealing loaves from her to the neighbor she said she didnt know anything and it was true my mom didnt know but she told us me and my younger sister were very scared in the end i think the neighbors were suspicious because i had a shoe and the prints they found there were identical to those on my shoes but they were only suspicions to date it is not clearly known that we were the ones who went into the neighbors house to take the loaves now i remember everything i did being younger and i still know thats wrong but we did it because mom never bought us the things we wanted and we could only get things and be happy with my brothers
me and my mother have an up and down relationship sometimes well be best friends the next shell wish i was never born a burden to her
it was my payday as soon as i got home she demanded  dollars from me i had just given her  two days prior i knew what it was for she wanted to gamble or she was giving it to my stepdad so he could gamble no matter how many times i told her no she would get louder and louder and threaten me more so i just gave in she wasnt gonna pay me back she never does but what could i do 

a few days later me and her were talking in her room when she got up to leave i saw it  dollars dropping from her wallet when i saw it i didnt know what got ahold of me this felt like my way of getting revenge being able to pay myself back kinda i quickly pocket the money and went on my way a few hours later my mom called in a frantic asking if id seen  dollars around the house i told her no straight to her face and hung up
to this day she still doesnt know i hated stealing and lying to my mothers face but i also still feel it was deserved after years of her taking from me ive been living with this guilt for about a month now and it eats me alive everyday and keeps me awake at night im sorry mom

edit man every single ones of yalls comments make me smile and tear up i wish i can thank you all personally for all the advice ive been given and the feedback even though i still feel guilty i feel a lot better knowing im somewhat reasonable for my doings for those with similar stories to share i also feel deeply for you youve all help me a lot thank you so much
i was getting to the point where school work was beginning to seem incredibly pointless to me and so i decided one time to just make up a book and write my book report based on whatever came to my mind made up the title and the author and the plot and the lessons to be learned from it and everything never got called out on it for some reason the funny thing is i was a voracious reader at the time and could have picked any of the multiple books i had finished reading recently but it just seemed more fun to do it this way
my roommate and i have been living together for like six years now we were really close friends as teenagers and continued to be into adulthood our personalities work really well together but as weve gotten older shes become pretty lazy and stopped doing any housework at all whatsoever when we moved into our most recent apartment i suggested that we get paper utensils and plates since we both work a lot and i didnt want the workload of the apartment to get to be too much for us i really meant me as im the only one doing anything she didnt listen and insisted on buying this set of like  dollar platesbowls long story short whenever she leaves her dirty dishes in the sink for longer than two days i just throw them in the dumpster i am not being a maid to a grown ass woman especially considering i work more than her i will not be renewing this lease but i do feel kind of bad that good quality dishes are getting thrown out
i was in primary school at the time must have been around  or  and we had a competition to write a short story we had one class to complete the task 

ive always loved writing had a way with words and have always dreamed of becoming a writer never worked out like that anyway i probably had my first case of writers block nothing came to mind and i furiously started writing nonsense on the page scribbling it out again and again then i remembered something i had recently watched a new episode of goosebumps so i wrote it down the entire episode from what i could remember a goddamn goosebumps episode 

a week or so later i had a dentist appointment and as i got back to school a bunch of girls were telling me how the teacher was telling everyone that i was a truly gifted writer that it was such a good story that i had won the st prize i was congratulated in front of the school later that day for my creativity and skill

i have such social anxiety and felt so bad that i accepted the award and acted grateful but inside i was full of guilt

whoops
okay so i was leaving my house yesterday and saw that a car was parked literally touching my car blocking my neighbors driveway while there is plenty of street parking and my trashcans were driven into and dumped out that were sitting out for pickup at first view im just thinking this was just someone being a dickhead i live in a big city so its not uncommon for things like this they also hit my car hard enough that the honda symbol came off and had a few scratches in the heat of my anger i decided to put mustard on the hood of their car i had to leave and when i backed up the car rolled and hit me again so now idk if this persons breaks were just broken and didnt know their car rolled into mine if it was stolen and just abandoned in that weird condition or what is the deal i had to leave so it ended up just rolling into my roommates car and is still there anyways i felt awful all day thats not something i would normally do but my anger got the best of me and i spent all day in a im in trouble anxious mode in my body i learned i do not agree with an eye for an eye it did not make me feel any better to get retaliation 
also anyone know what we should do about this free rolling car once my roommate leaves for work it will just hit the next guy
so this happened almost  years ago now i  m went to a k private school for most of my life when i was in th grade my younger brother entered kindergarten every day would walk down to the kindergarten room to pick up my brother and we would walk home together

one day i was walking down to the kindergarten room and during my walk i always pass the first grade room they dont have lockers for kindergarten and first grade just hooks in the hall outside the room to hang their coatsbags and a shelf just above to place their lunch boxes this particular day i was walking down the hall which was totally empty as i usually left my study hall a bit early to get to my brothers classroom before the halls are crowded and i noticed as i passed the hooks and shelf outside the first grade room that there was a fairly large container with pokmon cards inside on the shelf 

for context of why i did this i have been collecting pokmon cards for years but my family wasnt super rich or anything so i didnt have many in my collection compared to other kids i knew maybe  cards of my own i dont know what came over me but i took the container of cards didnt even think twice about it i stuffed it in my backpack and continued on with my day frankly i had completely forgotten about it until recently and i just wanted to get it off my chest without having to tell someone i know and have them think that im a terrible person 
so ive recently started my new job its a at a pawn shop lets label it pawn shop a but i feel so dirty i feel like a criminal who has committed fraud 

for a broader context the past year i worked at a pawn shop in london upon returning to my home town two months ago i temporarily took up a part time job at a pawn shop call it pawn shop b down the street from the one im currently working at the thing is in my cv i included that i worked at the one in london the past year but not that i had at the time been working at pawn shop b as i had only been there a few works doing  hours a week but in the interview i lied and said i didnt work there out of fear that i would get rejected either for it being a conflict of interest or just being rejected for leaving a place after only having been there for a month so ive stated my new job at pawn shop a and literally nobody has any idea that just a few weeks ago i worked at pawn shop b down the street 

i just feel like such a rotten horrible person i feel so guilty like a no good criminal and fuck am i scared of what legal action would get taken against me if they found out 

for context i took on the new job at pawn shop a because the hours are very good its full time  hours a week i had no malicious intent im just trying to do better to support myself and my girlfriend but i know that doesnt justify that im a fraud and a liar
title says it all i found cash probably at least  in my buddys laundry while housesitting for him originally i left it in with his clean clothes for him to find later but after a couple days i started noticing things around the house that needed replacing or would be helpful for him to have so ive slowly been spending his cash on cleaning and pet supplies but i feel guilty because i feel like its a total control freak move to be deciding how to spend his forgotten money so maybe ill replace it before he gets back lol
