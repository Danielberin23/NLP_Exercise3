0	I'm f'ed up and I cannot fix it no matter what I do.	When I was younger I was fat, but I'm hilarious so I was considered the 'funny' friend. Over the years I've loss some weight but I'm no where to being what I consider thin; I still feel uncomfortable at times wearing cropped shirts or low-waisted jeans even though my friends say I look good. I know I'm not ugly, but I don't feel pretty. My closest friends that I'm always around are feminine pretty, while I guess I'm androgynous. I'm so sick of not being anyone's first choice, and I can't even look at myself without feeling disgusted. #lol	1e4xvti	im fed up and i cannot fix it no matter what i do	when i was younger i was fat but im hilarious so i was considered the funny friend over the years ive loss some weight but im no where to being what i consider thin i still feel uncomfortable at times wearing cropped shirts or lowwaisted jeans even though my friends say i look good i know im not ugly but i dont feel pretty my closest friends that im always around are feminine pretty while i guess im androgynous im so sick of not being anyones first choice and i cant even look at myself without feeling disgusted lol	exvti
1	I'm 45 years of age and still suck my thumb as a means of soothing 	I'm 45 M and still suck my thumb and honestly don't want to stop - as much as I also do  want to stop. I do it in secret and that's why I prefer to sleep at my own place or sleep in my own bed so that I can basically suck my thumb. I wonder if there are other adults who still suck their thumb and whether it gives them the comfort as it gives me. Also, is there some sort of stigma attached to it? I feel these days everything goes...does thumb sucking fall into the acceptable category already?	1e4xvcj	im  years of age and still suck my thumb as a means of soothing 	im  m and still suck my thumb and honestly dont want to stop  as much as i also do  want to stop i do it in secret and thats why i prefer to sleep at my own place or sleep in my own bed so that i can basically suck my thumb i wonder if there are other adults who still suck their thumb and whether it gives them the comfort as it gives me also is there some sort of stigma attached to it i feel these days everything goesdoes thumb sucking fall into the acceptable category already	exvcj
2	I only paid for half of the price of a cake, knowingly 	"More than a year ago, I went to my local grocery store to have a costume cake made. I usually go to the bakery but I needed it done in 3 days & the bakery needs at least a week. 

It was a very simple 2-tier cake. It was for my son's first birthday & the theme was Mickey mouse. I found a cake on google that I liked. It was all baby blue with yellow borders & Mickey & Minnie figurines on top. That was it. I had to pay for half of the price up front, which I did. 

When I went to pick it up, I was disappointed. It was a different shade of blue, only the bottom of the cake had the yellow border, & no Mickey mouse figurines. 

After she handed me the cake, she went back to work on something else. I stayed there, waiting for her to charge me the rest but she didn't. That's when I realized that she thought I had already paid for everything. As I was about to walk away, she asked me if I needed anything else. I was about to mention the charge but instead I said I needed the mickey toys for the cake. She handed me a small bag w a mickey & Minnie in it & I made a run for it. 

About an hour later, I got a call from them. The first thing they said was the name of the store so I hung up. They called me for the following 2 days but I never answered. I think If they would've done the cake how I wanted it, I would've done the right thing there but I just didn't. 

I still feel really bad about it but it's been so long so I don't think I can make it right by now. The cake was $80, btw.

3	I lied on my resume because I was desperate for work.	"I recently graduated from grad school and have been struggling to find a job. Despite my efforts, I haven't received any offers.

On LinkedIn, I came across a discussion about companies making unrealistic demands for experience, like requiring over five years of experience with ChatGPT, which has only been available for barely two years. Many people suggested that exaggerating or lying on a resume is acceptable as long as you can prove your expertise. For instance, claiming two years of experience is fine if you can meet the job's requirements.

As a recent graduate in chemical engineering, I only have half a year of industry training. With no job offers and only two months' worth of savings left to cover my rent, I was getting desperate. I knew my academic training exceeded the job requirements, so instead of listing half a year of work experience, I claimed one year.

Since then, I've started getting interviews, but the guilt of lying has been overwhelming. After a week, I reverted my resume to reflect the truth. I need to confess that lying was wrong, and from now on, I am committed to being honest."	1e4fg9e	i lied on my resume because i was desperate for work	"i recently graduated from grad school and have been struggling to find a job despite my efforts i havent received any offers

4	[Extreme Remorse] I relieved my pets from suffering	"[Extreme Remorse]

I grew up with pets. Yeah, you can probably tell where this is going. But I want to come clean. I won't go into too many details because thinking about it still makes me cry and it was extremely traumatising. Some of our pets were treated fairly. But most? Lived in horrible conditions. I love animals so much, even as a child i knew how wrong it was to keep our rabbit as a loner in a cage that was not even double his size - an occurance that the rabbit wasn't the only victim off. We never brought them to a vet either - in fact my mother used their suffering as a punishment for me. (Yeah, I didn't grow up in a nice environment..) And one of our rabbits was really sick. He had an URI (no need for a vet. You could easily tell he had trouble breathing besides other things.). I begged my mother. All she had to say was ""it's just a rabbit. It'll pass (the sickness, not the rabbit)."" Spoiler alert: it did not. And i had to listen to it fight to breathe every night as his cage was set in my room (URIs in small pets are NOT pretty to listen to or to ""watch"". And mind you, i did not necessarily want this rabbit. It was just there one day when I came back from school. But I got the responsibility later on.) I think I was 13. I decided to relieve it from it's suffering. I couldn't sleep on my bed for days because I was scared I'd be damned and haunted by a higher entity - I, now an adult, still fear that. And I cried. So. So much. Again, I am an adult now. I swore to myself I'd never do that again, even though the first time I did it was also just out of pure guilt. But I did, a few months ago.I have rats. Well - I had two rats. One of them got extremely sick on a Friday. One day to another. He was wobbling, fell over, fell from his climbing material, disoriented, trouble breathing, no bowel control.... I hadn't noticed he had lost so much weight because he was the rat that never let me touch him much. And during those 3 or 2 weeks I was extremely busy with work things, so I couldn't handle them a lot either. Anyway, I'm not trying to make excuses. It was my neglect, I know that. I put him out of his misery myself as well as no vet (emergency exotic pet vets do not exist where I live... also a mistake of mine...) was open during that time and I was not able to bear to see him suffer through the weekend when he wasn't even able to walk properly. I did my research and put him down in the most humane way I had access to. Okay. Now I have 1 rat left. He seemed fine. Until a few days ago. Same symptoms as the first rat. Same circumstances - and not even money available. 2 choices: Pray and hope (which has never helped anybody) or Same fate as the other rat.
With that came the fact that besides the neurological signs, there are circumstantial problems as well that do not have anything to do with his health. And this is where I was selfish for the first time. I chose the latter. This was the first time I didn't necessarily need to relieve him. Maybe I could've waited. But I have no money currently because of unfortunate events out of my own control. This is the death I feel most guilty about. And this might be the one that - if hell and heaven exists - I will end up burning for. I never hit an animal. I never kicked, yelled, ... at one. I cried when I cut a Rainworm in half to test the myth of both halves of it living. I tear up when I accidentally step on snails. I swear, I am no monster. At least I don't hope I am. I am so sorry. I really am.

I thought about confessing this to a priest. Or my therapist. But I'm scared that maybe I am just a monster. Maybe rightfully so.

5	I lied about being color blind all through high school 	When I was a kid I was super awkward and had no friends. When I got into high school all the friends I had previously spent time with had moved away and I had to make a whole new group of friends which really sucked.  Because I didn’t make friends well I had to come up with a cool story so that people would like me so I told everyone I was fully color blind. People would ask me what color things were and I’d just say a random color. And when people asked like how I matched clothes and stuff I always told them that I guessed based on the shades of grey. The good part about it all was I never got graded on color accuracy on any project I ever did. The bad part was that it got a lot of other people in trouble because they were kind mean. I had a science partner that scratched the colors off the table colored pencils just to make it impossible for me to do the project we were doing. I got to use my notes for that science final because I wasn’t able to use a color coded map. Even now if I see someone from high school they’ll laugh and ask me what color something is and I just laugh it off. I kinda feel bad looking back now but it’s too late to tell the truth 🤷‍♀️	1e44gbj	i lied about being color blind all through high school 	when i was a kid i was super awkward and had no friends when i got into high school all the friends i had previously spent time with had moved away and i had to make a whole new group of friends which really sucked  because i didnt make friends well i had to come up with a cool story so that people would like me so i told everyone i was fully color blind people would ask me what color things were and id just say a random color and when people asked like how i matched clothes and stuff i always told them that i guessed based on the shades of grey the good part about it all was i never got graded on color accuracy on any project i ever did the bad part was that it got a lot of other people in trouble because they were kind mean i had a science partner that scratched the colors off the table colored pencils just to make it impossible for me to do the project we were doing i got to use my notes for that science final because i wasnt able to use a color coded map even now if i see someone from high school theyll laugh and ask me what color something is and i just laugh it off i kinda feel bad looking back now but its too late to tell the truth 	egbj
6	i lied about being allergic to shellfish for years	"here's the deal. About five years ago, I started dating this girl who was crazy about seafood. I'm talking, she lived for shrimp, crab, lobster, you name it. The problem was, I really hated shellfish. Just the smell made me gag. But I wanted to impress her, so I told her I was allergic to shellfish. At first, it seemed harmless. She was super understanding and made sure we never went to seafood places.

Fast forward a couple of years, we're still together, and my ""allergy"" has become this huge deal. Her family knows, our friends know, even my coworkers know. They've all been so considerate and careful about it, and I feel like the biggest jerk ever. I never thought it would go on this long, but now I'm in too deep. I feel like if I come clean, everyone will hate me for lying all these years.

I just needed to get this off my chest. Maybe I'll tell her someday, but for now, I'm stuck living this lie.

7	my whole family thinks i’ve been sober for the past year… 	"I’m 19 (f) and about a year ago a spiraled into a really horrible state of addiction. 

it started with drinking, i moved out for the first time and had a lot of free time, i started drinking more bc i was bored. 
the house started to creep me out, keeping me up at night, so i started drinking to fall asleep. 
it spiraled over the course of 2 months ish to me drinking all hours of the day. Taking shots in the bathroom at work, as soon as I woke up, as soon as i did anything really. I felt more drunk when I stopped drinking and it got really bad really fast. I realized I couldn’t not drink and at one point when i ran out of alcohol i started hallucinating. so instead of addressing the problem i just kept on drinking. 

my roommate stopped coming home because she said she was “tired of watching me kill myself.” 
i didn’t realize it at the time, but i legitimately looked like i was dying. 
and i was dying 

I don’t remember anything leading up to it but i fell into a drug binge. 
I stayed up doing coke with friends for days on end, and when i ran out i would pop a xanax to help me sleep it off. I slept for 2 days at one point (according to my roommate). 

One night after falling asleep after a coke binge (no xanax involved) I had two back to back seizures. thank god my friend happened to be in my room. it was a terrifying experience, the most terrifying and traumatic experience of my life and I have such horrible PTSD from it but I never talk about it to anyone. 

after i got back from the hospital i ruled out cocaine. i don’t remember how the next part started. I just remember “waking up” and a week had gone by and i had been doing benzos and oxys for the entire time. I don’t remember a thing and it’s terrifying. I know that the guy who was giving them to me had laced me with fentanyl, which led to me overdosing and back in the hospital, and i’ve been told that he also raped me. 

i could go into a lot more detail but I ended up in rehab for a while followed by intensive outpatient treatment. 

i’m 19 now and everyone thinks i’ve been sober since, i mean to be fair i really have gotten my shit together. I started my first year of college straight out of rehab and finished with good grades. I’ve made good friends, found a healthy relationship, moved into a new apartment, started teaching art classes, and have genuinely been relatively happy. 

but i’m not sober. I was actually only sober for 3 weeks.

8	In an unemployed addict living with my mom, and I’m the only one who knows…	Im a guy, 20 years old. I’ve always had an addictive personality, acquired it from my departed dad’s side of the family, I believe. I used to be a heavy marijuana user, but managed to “kick” the habit for a week or two, only to replace it with alcohol, and a whole lot of it. Over the last couple of months I’ve been on a streak of drinking 7-8 beers/4-5 shots a night, whatever’s available, any day of the week. And when I run out, I take small, calculated amounts from my mother’s stash - a beer or 2, maybe a large glass of vodka (or 2, replace with water) A few days ago I was fired from my job of almost 3 years because I kept calling off since I was too hungover. So far I haven’t told anyone that I’ve lost my job. Instead, I’ve been doordashing during the hours that I normally would work, in order to fund my habit and convince others that I still have a job, no other reason. As a 20 year old college student living at home, I feel like an absolute scumbag, I’m saying that because I know that everyone reading this is thinking the same thing. I haven’t even bothered to apply for my junior year college courses… I don’t want to make this too long, so I’ll just say if anyone is going through/has gone through this situation I’d love to have a chat with you, since I feel that I have no one in my life that I can talk to about this mess I’ve made for myself.

She struggled with everyone in line having to restart multiple times with each person. By the time I got there I was running slim on time and needed to be back to work in 10 minutes. She rung me up and the voided it because she rang my combo up then added a drink and fries. Had to correct her then she voided and tried again this time a combo, but not the one I got. Had to correct her again and I was getting a bit frustrated because now I had 6 minutes to get back to work. 

 The last time she rings me up just for the catfish (6$) and I don't bother to correct her and just pay and leave before she realized it wasn't right either. I hope she doesn't get in trouble and if I wasn't in a rush I'd stay to fix it, but my job is nice enough to let us leave the site on the clock to go get food so I try not to push if I can.

14	"Took ""lost"" money from work that we were suppose to share with my collegue but i never told her."	"So basically i work in a shop and we have an old safe that the boss lost the key of and there's still some old enveloppe with money left, the superior doesn't care about it anymore. So my collegue told me we should get it, there's a small hole but she never managed to get it, it has been there for 4 years, so she had her chance, everyone did. So i managed to get with some scotch and thread. There was 900€, i left around 100€ inside and put it back just the way it was so if someone look inside with a flashlight they still see that it hasn't been touched. So if my collegue or someone else manage to get it, there's no proof it was me who took the money, it could have been anyone working here. 
But I mostly feel guilty about my collegue because we said we will share but i don't want to, i need money and 400€ is not much...

15	I destroyed a woman’s house and blamed it on her son	"Hello fellow redditors. This happened a few years ago. I had been on a drug called melanotan, which is a tanning injection substance with a potent viagra-esque side effect. I was feeling quite ravenous, not talking hunger. I went on bumble and decided to find someone who could help me with my problem. I matched with a cute woman in her 50’s, and she was on there looking for casual fun so it was perfect. We exchanged info and the next morning it was arranged for me to come over and help “water her flowers.” It had been quite a long time since I got some wound, so the excitement was supreme. 

I arrived the next day and she greeted me at the door with a hug. I was so fucking angry it was unreal, but I kept my cool. She got me some water and I sat on the couch. After some time, her 20-something year old son came out and introduced himself. I hated him immediately, and he knew it. He INSISTED that his mom go to the store to get some more milk. She left and said she’d be back soon. I was so lustful at this point that I even made moves on her son, but he turned me down. 

I struck up some conversation with him. “Do you and your mom get along well?” I said. He said “no, she’s always bringing over whoremongers like you and ruining my life.” That’s where I drew the line. I may be a lot of things, but I’m no whoremonger. I stifled my fury and made some friendly banter with him until he started to warm up to me. I noticed he had headphones around his neck so I suggested he listen to “Reign In Blood” by Slayer (I did this so he wouldn’t hear shit.) He said he would then went to his room. I then proceeded to the kitchen and I threw all the dishes to the ground. I got my knife out and stabbed up all the couches and pillows and threw the fuzzy stuff everywhere. I emptied the fridge’s contents and threw it to the ground, etc.

After destroying the house, I waited for her return. The son was probably too busy clopping or some shit to notice. In the meantime I cut a 7 inch cut on my right cheek, and destroyed my phone with a hammer. I left the knife, hammer, and phone there and when her car pulled up in the driveway I threw the door open and staggered outside like I was crippled. She got out of the car and I yelled “your son is fucking crazy! He started breaking shit and making a mess, and then he attacked me! He destroyed my phone with a hammer so I couldn’t get help! You need to call the fucking cops!” I got in my car and sped off. That’s when the regret hit me like a ton of bricks. I destroyed my phone, mangled my face, destroyed a nice woman’s home, and for what? So I could get revenge on some kid? I never heard from her or saw her again. 

TL;DR: I met a woman on bumble to hookup, got cock blocked by her son, so I got revenge my destroying a bunch of shit in her home and blaming it on him.

17	I lied about having an auto immune disorder at work 	"I have horrible anxiety that I have managed mostly successfully for about 10 yrs but I always need a safety net or an out for when things get bad. At my last job I was very honest about my anxiety, maybe too honest. Mental health has a stigma, as much as we talk about it and it accept it now are a lot of people, especially in the workplace and older people, who see anxiety as a weakness. I genuinely think it’s the reason I lost a promotion at my last job. 

I got a new job about 3 yrs ago and tried a different avenue. Lying. Physical conditions are much more accepted than mental conditions. I left it pretty vague but when I was hired I said hey I have an autoimmune disorder that makes day to day a little unpredictable, and I get sick often because of it and may have a lot of doctor appointments when I have a flare up. Which is true, but it’s a therapist and not a rheumatologist. 

This has worked out amazingly so far. No one blinks an eye when I have to take a last min PTO day, or have a “dr” appointment mid day, or when I need to leave the office and work from home. I work at a healthcare insurance company and they take HIPPA and every other privacy law very very seriously so I know for a fact that I will never be asked to prove it with any sort of doctors note.

18	I have snuck outside of the house fully naked before.	"And no, not just a one time thing. Keep in mind, this was usually done in the winter, so before I had a vehicle with autostart, I'd walk out to my car early in the morning (this time of year I had somewhere to be in half an hour), wearing either just my robe or a shirt and shorts with no underwear. I'd open or drop the robe / clothing for a brief moment after walking behind my house after starting my car. The thrill of it was just incredible.

I do not suggest doing this if you live in a town."	1e0g4sf	i have snuck outside of the house fully naked before	"and no not just a one time thing keep in mind this was usually done in the winter so before i had a vehicle with autostart id walk out to my car early in the morning this time of year i had somewhere to be in half an hour wearing either just my robe or a shirt and shorts with no underwear id open or drop the robe  clothing for a brief moment after walking behind my house after starting my car the thrill of it was just incredible

19	I was on the wrong side of the road when I was driving 	"This past week I've been taking my girlfriend to work because her car is in the shop. She works 12 hour night shifts. Today I took her to work and on my way back I decided to go to a gas station for some food. When I left I got to a intersection and the light was red and I was stopped on the left side of the road. The lane I should be in was on the right and there was 4 cars there as well. I didn't realize I was on the wrong side until later. Something started to feel off, and when I looked at the traffic light it was on the right side. Then I looked at those 4 cars on that side then I realized. And then, the wrong lane I was in the light turned green. Literally all the cars driving my direction were looking at me. And then, my light took forever to turn green and I started to think I need to somehow get over to that side. 

I started trying to back up that's when the light turned green. I waited for those 4 cars to go by then I made my turn. Honestly, I am familiar with this area I've lived here for 12 years and been to that part so many times. I just had a brain malfunction and didn't know what I was doing. Sometimes when I'm driving I get brain malfunctions and do things I don't normally do. It is very rare, but it does happen sometimes.

21	I lied to get my current job and it pays really well. 	"I (38f) lied on my resume to land a job I wasn't qualified for. The initial interview went smoother than expected; my fabricated qualifications seemed to impress them. Before I knew it, I was advancing to the next round. The job offer came, and I accepted, despite the sinking feeling in my gut.

As I stepped into the role, reality hit me hard. I was drowning in tasks I had no idea how to handle. Panic set in as I struggled to keep up with the demands of the job. I sought help online, connecting with others in similar positions who generously shared their expertise. 
     
Day by day, I learned the ropes through trial and error. Slowly, I started to grasp the intricacies of the job. The feeling of being overshadowed began to fade as my confidence grew. I persevered, determined to prove myself worthy of the position.

Fifteen years have passed since that fateful decision. I am now a master at my job, a testament to resilience and hard work. The lie that got me in the door has transformed into a success story of perseverance and growth. 

 
A part of me is very proud of what I've been able to accomplish, while the other side is disgusted with me for cutting corners. I've never told anyone besides my husband and he even told me he doesn't believe I really did that. 

Edit: I'm a Senior Fraud Analyst now. Started off in collections and insurance disputes.

22	I lied about being stung by a bee and having an allergic reaction	"So I know this sounds bad, and it kind of is. This happened when I was 15/16. I was at a week long summer camp on some forested island in the middle of bumblef**k. I was put in the groups for the oldest kids, but I was still a year older than everyone there. Girls in my cabin snored, the guys weren’t cute, and one night we had to sleep on the ground with raccoons running across us. I was NOT having it, I want to go back to my villa. I smell like Shreks swamp 

So the 3rd or 4th morning I hatched a plan. I have a shellfish allergy, so the camp had my epipen along with my other medications. I decided, while waiting in line for the bathroom at breakfast, to put my acting skills to the test. Labored breathing, bugged out eyes, the works. The other campers were like SHES DYINGGGGG and they took me to the med people. I wheezed out “BEE….STING!” They asked me if I was allergic and I gave them a look of “what do you think dude?” I made the leg stabbing motion of the epi pen and they grabbed it and gave me the stab. Of course, by now I had gathered a audience of a bunch of 8-12 year old with terror in their eyes. They called the ambulance, dudes came in and gave me an IV, heart rate, Yk. They asked me about my voice, as I have a very raspy and deep voice, especially for a girl. I let them know I’ve always had a voice like this and it’s unrelated. I got carted off to the “Health Hut” to be monitored. I would have to stay there for a few hours before I could go back to the camp stuff. However, if I had another reaction, they would have to take me to the hospital. I was like “Ok ☹️” in the most slightly traumatized but also annoyed teenager voice I could muster. I lay there, staring at the bunk above me. We weren’t allowed to bring our phones to the camp, so I was bored out of my mind.  45 ish minutes later, I decided to start the show again. They came in and took me to a smaller room and gave me another dose of epinephrine. The ambulance came back and said they didn’t have a choice but to take me to the hospital. Hopped in the ambulance with like 70 kids gawking at me, drove on the bumpiest road I’ve ever been on, and all of a sudden. We stopped. Why are we stopped. 

*BPBPBPBPBBPPBBPPBBPPBPBPBPBPBPPPBPBPBPBPPBBBBBBBBRRRNPPPPBRPPPBPBPBPPPPPPPPPPP*

Me: “Is that a f**king helicopter 

Ambulance guy: “We’re on an island dude”

Me: “Oh yeah..”

Getting into the back of that helicopter was honestly wild, it’s such a tight space in there I was glad I wasn’t claustrophobic. The helicopter dude was trying to keep me calm by talking to me about where I was from.

“So Scarlett how old are you? Are you from around here?”

Me: I’m 16, and sort of. I live in ********

Helicopter guy: “Oh no way my family is from there too! I’m not around much obviously since I’m an air ambulance guy. My kids are your age what school do you go to?”

Me: “Uhh I go to ********”

Helicopter guy: “Ohh no way my kids go there! You’re a sophomore right?”

Me: “Yea”

Helicopter guy: “My daughter is a sophomore too!

Me: “I don’t know if this is like confidential or something, but what’s your daughter’s name? Maybe I know her?”

I’m sick of typing helicopter guy, his name is now HG

HG: “Penelope Millard” (not real name)

Me: “No way I do know her! She’s good friends with one of my good friends. You probably know her, Kyra?” (Not real name)

HG: “Yep Kyra is over at our place all the time! What a small world!”

Me: “Don’t know if this violates HIPAA since I’m asking you to give away my name, but tell her I said hi lol” 

HG: “I’ll tell her I lifted one of her friends to the hospital haha, you should tell her.”

Me: *passes tf out from the Benadryl*

Fast forward like two hours, my mom makes the two hour drive to the hospital I was at and was like “what the hell did you do child.” I just rolled my eyes and kept reading my book. I stayed in the hospital for a little longer, then was able to go home. 
(Not related but all my stuff was left at the camp and I had to pick it up at the end of the week)

I did NOT tell my mom that I faked the whole thing. Obviously.

Month ish later I got allergy tested. When the results came back.. THEY WERE POSITIVE. TO LIKE, EVERY KIND OF BEE/WASP/HORNET. I was stunned. I’ve never been stung by a bee before, I’ve been terrified of them my whole life. But allergic? Like full on anaphylactic allergy? I mean, now I know! I don’t know when I’ll tell my parents this, probably on their death bed. So yeah. Sorry this was so long and also sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile. 

TLDR: faked a bee sting, got airlifted off an island. Turns out I’m actually allergic to bees

Extra: went up to Kyra at school and was like “your dad airlifted me off an island.” She was like, “What-“ I explained it to her(minus the part where I faked the whole bee sting) and she was like “yeah he told me something about meeting one of my friends on the job, didn’t know it was you though!” Funny stuff

Edit: Spelling. Also, it’s not my problem that you didn’t know what HIPAA laws were when you were 16, I was doing anatomy and physiology classes in and out of school since middle school. I knew plenty of shit about medicine at 16. And if you don’t believe you can kiss my voluptuous ass. <3

23	I and writing fake notes in my English class at school!	"They're false love notes. This English class is small with only 13 people. When I write the notes I put somebody else's name on it and I keep putting the same persons name on it. The guys name I keep putting on it, he has sloppy handwriting. I purposely make my writing sloppy so my real writing isn't identified and so it looks like his. I fold the note up and write on the front who it's going to and who's it's from. This has been going on for a while and the teacher is trying to hunt down the culprit. Here's what happened yesterday. I went to english class early so I can deliver the note on a desk. At the time being, there was only 3 people in the room.

The teacher was going around putting papers on desk as we were going to take a test. She came by and found the note. She opened it and read it.

24	Recently relapsed after 5 years and regret my actions and don’t know how to tell anyone 	I (23F) was introduced to drugs and abusing substances at a young age through my parents and siblings. Growing up my father used a lot of drugs (Heroin, Coke, Weed, Nicotine) and possibly more that I might not know about. While my mother would drink an insane amount of alcohol and used nicotine as well until she quit. Once I hit the age of 11/12 I started paying more attention and my dad had his first overdose in front of me. At the time my brother who was also using with my father handled the situation but I was unaware he was also high. After about 2/3 years I started stealing packs of cigarettes from my parents because before my mom quite they would buy about 5/6 packs, and my father would never notice one of his being missing because she bought them and he’d be high. After smoking cigarettes for about a year I then started smoking weed/dabs with basically all of my friend groups. I have a poor memory of my high school time but at some point I was introduced to Cocaine and started doing that a lot which led to a lot more drug and alcohol abuse down the line. I finally quit around 19 and had been sober for about 5 years now until recently. I don’t really know why I did it but I was offered cocaine about 4 months  and decided to do it. Since then I’ve done it about 4/5 times and I can tell it’s becoming a problem. I’m afraid to reach out for help as I am ashamed and regret my choices but I don’t know if it’s possible to get sober without telling anyone.	1dyxgzm	recently relapsed after  years and regret my actions and dont know how to tell anyone 	i f was introduced to drugs and abusing substances at a young age through my parents and siblings growing up my father used a lot of drugs heroin coke weed nicotine and possibly more that i might not know about while my mother would drink an insane amount of alcohol and used nicotine as well until she quit once i hit the age of  i started paying more attention and my dad had his first overdose in front of me at the time my brother who was also using with my father handled the situation but i was unaware he was also high after about  years i started stealing packs of cigarettes from my parents because before my mom quite they would buy about  packs and my father would never notice one of his being missing because she bought them and hed be high after smoking cigarettes for about a year i then started smoking weeddabs with basically all of my friend groups i have a poor memory of my high school time but at some point i was introduced to cocaine and started doing that a lot which led to a lot more drug and alcohol abuse down the line i finally quit around  and had been sober for about  years now until recently i dont really know why i did it but i was offered cocaine about  months  and decided to do it since then ive done it about  times and i can tell its becoming a problem im afraid to reach out for help as i am ashamed and regret my choices but i dont know if its possible to get sober without telling anyone	dyxgzm
25	I realized I steal so often its become a habit of mine	"I've stolen from many places, usually grocery stores.. I'll see something I want and I won't even think about stealing it I'll just do it without any thought or anxiety. I do it so often its like a reflex, I've done it out of greed. I've done it out of desperation. And I've always justified it by thinking ""well they're huge corporations they don't care"" and I've deluded myself into thinking it's okay when in the back of my mind I know it's not. I've been doing it since I was a little kid. I've stolen food, ive stolen clothes, ive stolen jewelry, ive stolen makeup, skincare, perfume, toys. Ive stolen so many things its disgusting, ive even stolen bolts.. BOLTS. FROM HOME DEPOT. I DONT NEED THOSE!?!!?!? writing this out now I think I have a problem, ive never stolen a huge amount of products at once nor anything that's extremely expensive but I don't think that really matters considering how often I steal. I've let myself become evil without a second thought and I'm ashamed ☹️

But I want to put an end to this and I'm going to now. I don't want to keep justifying my greed and selfishness and I don't want to keep making myself think that I'm an honest person when I literally steal everytime I go to the store. I want to make up for my wrongdoings but I'm not sure where to start besides acknowledging it and putting an end to it.

26	I'm selfish and I'm digusted on how it's turned out for me.	"I want to start off saying I'm very, very young, but this feeling grew within me. Ever since I can remember, I hated living, I was 4 when I started praying for death. Not even that, I've been just angry at the world ever since my mother brought me into this. I was a brat when I was a kid, but I was also neglected and sometimes abused by my mother. My dad was deployed, barely in the picture. Hell, he isn't even my biological dad (We'll just call him J.). J is an alcoholic, narcissist, and will pick a fight when HE'S had a bad day. My parents fought all the time, leading to more trauma. It was never my mom's fault, but after a while, she went away. I didn't understand why until J started to pick fights with me (when I was 8.) He would mock me when I cried, calling me a crybaby, mocked my cries, mocked my own anger. After a while, I started yelling back, and nothing changed. He got a girlfriend, and now I had to deal with two of J's. That meant more bullshit. Well, I guess that my explanation right now, but a couple of months ago, was the last day of school. I was a little bitch, and I was selfish. I hurt my boyfriend and that's the only who I care about in the problem. I lost a friend due to my actions we'll call her K. 
K was a close friend but I always had one problem with her. She made me so insecure, she was in the gifted program, she was so selfish when it came to certain things. I mean, I would try to explain to her but she still went with her side of the story when it came to anything.
But what I did I still believe it was truly and moraly wrong. I don't wanna talk about cause it just makes me feel more like shit. But I honestly hate J. J is one of the reason why I can't/couldn't work on my anger issues, never got me into actual therapy when I needed it the most, I mean at one point I thought being put in a hospital was the best for me to make sure I didn't try to hurt myself again but he told me I had to go to school. 
I don't want to be this way. I want to be happy, I don't want to kill myself. But then I'm left alone, and it's like. Nobody cares. I hate being angry. I just want to make sure I better for people like my boyfriend. I want it to work out with him, he's the best thing in my life. I mean after a while J broke up with the girlfriend but now he just comes home drunk. I think I'll never be happy with living with J, maybe my mom. I'm trying to move in with her right now. But I just want everything to wash over so I can breathe and try to fix myself. I know all the saying, ""Things won't happen fast. But over time."" I FUCKING GET THAT. I just needed to speak about this.

Update...I honestly, I don't feel comfortable talking about my age if you all are wondering about it. I can get a little dramatic, but I honestly meant everything I said... J will deny anything call him out on. He's laid hands on me for just crying.. If not that when he's drunk, he's verbally abused me and my younger sister. For God's sake, this dumbass had thrown a shoe my little sister for not cleaning (his room is 10x worse, and I couldn't go in there with holding my breath or gagging). My mom is sober now, I'm moving in with her. If any of you are wondering about my boyfriend, he's okay. He and I talk about everything, and I'm working on my anger issues to make sure I don't affect him as his own person. I have gone to like school counseling, and I went to only one teacher, and it makes me always cry how he cared for me as a daughter, then my family, AT THE TIME. The reason why I blame my dad for most of my anger is because after a while, I started working on it on my own. Then, I was brought into this hostile place where the only way I guess ""points would get across"" would be yelling, screaming, and insults. I had asked J for therapy on multiple accounts, and he either lied about it or would ask, ""WHY WOULD YOU EVEN NEED THERAPY!?"" And even if I did try to explain myself, he would just deny it all.. I mean. When J and his girlfriend found out I was suicidal they laughed, and it took until I was in a hospital bed from an O.D. Just for them to be like, ""You're selfish."" But they realized I was fucked up but never did anything to help.  I mean.. That grandpa was bashing me in the comments, saying I was being overly dramatic, I guess I can see that?? But I'm also in my point of view, not in theirs, and I believe that anyone can believe what they want, but I was the one who went through that shit. Not them. (Forgot to say) Thank you all for the uplifting comments, I do read them when I have the time, thanks you so much. 💙"	1dyho7r	im selfish and im digusted on how its turned out for me	"i want to start off saying im very very young but this feeling grew within me ever since i can remember i hated living i was  when i started praying for death not even that ive been just angry at the world ever since my mother brought me into this i was a brat when i was a kid but i was also neglected and sometimes abused by my mother my dad was deployed barely in the picture hell he isnt even my biological dad well just call him j j is an alcoholic narcissist and will pick a fight when hes had a bad day my parents fought all the time leading to more trauma it was never my moms fault but after a while she went away i didnt understand why until j started to pick fights with me when i was  he would mock me when i cried calling me a crybaby mocked my cries mocked my own anger after a while i started yelling back and nothing changed he got a girlfriend and now i had to deal with two of js that meant more bullshit well i guess that my explanation right now but a couple of months ago was the last day of school i was a little bitch and i was selfish i hurt my boyfriend and thats the only who i care about in the problem i lost a friend due to my actions well call her k

29	I’ve lost 200,000 dollars in the past 3 years Gambling 	"I (25M) have a serious gambling problem and I’m not sure who to go anymore. It all started in the middle of Covid with 25$ here and there. Betting on sports and playing blackjack for fun. Never really was a big issue. Never betting more than I could handle Never betting more than I could handle I have a great job. I have a great job that pays me 100k+ a year. I still live at home and pay the little necessities like rent and bills. 

In 2022 it got bad I lost about $80,000 without anybody knowing my entire life savings gone. I called 1- 800 gambler got myself banned from my respective state from all casinos and online and even told my mother about it. I was doing good for about three months and then 2023 hit and I found this app where I could bet cryptocurrency. So I started there entering in $500 here and there. I want help I know I need help and I get into these moods where I just can’t stop even though I know it’s bad. I can’t help myself. 

Been through all the swings, the gamblers have the winnings, the losings. I’m unaware of what to do and where to go. I lost it all last night. I’ve been up all night thinking about it.

30	I drowned myself so a hot Life Gaurd would hold me.	"So this happened when I was 10 I think. I could always swim and I went to vacation with friends family.

I went beach and saw this hot life gaurd. I'd never felt so enamored by another man before. I wanted him to hold me. I tried talking to him but he was distant and focused.

(Which makes sense considered i was a fucking 10 year old and he was doing a life saving job) 

However even then, he was sweet and patient and I remember he said he liked anime and that was all I needed. I think he was maybe 17.

He was also very warm despite his focus. I could tell in a normal conversation he was probably even more so. I never had a problem flirting with girls. It was so easy it was boring even at 10. It wouldn't be anything weird but I like your hair we should go watch the new transformers, stuff like that. But he felt so untouchable it made me want to try harder.

So I kept thinking of ways to get his attention and I decided to drown myself. Not as a joke though. I went underwater and took a breath. It felt so bad and I was panicking so much I end up flailing like I was really drowning. 

Which I guess I was.

So it's really painful, salt water in my eyes and my lungs and I feel like throwing up and I'm forgetting how to swim or stay boyant. It only lasted for maybe 15 seconds. 

Eventually I was rescued. Not by the guy but by some teenage girl really close by. She was like 16 and apparently the only one that noticed something was wrong. My friend said I was lucky I got saved and got cpr or whatever about her being hot but I was so disappointed. 

I am and was attracted to women but that was not what I wanted. I was disappointed. And drowning hurt so much. I asked my friend not to tell his parents. (He knew about the plan)

Idk I don't really feel guilty I feel annoyed that I know what drowning feels like. But I do feel guilty that I could have been saved while someone who was really drowning needed help.

Also the parents are not at fault they've watched me swim laps around them and I purposely went within the 5 minutes they went to get us snacks. My friends older sister was watching us and I purposely went where she couldn't watch me and her brother at the same time.

Luckily the lady that saved me took me to her umbrella thing so his sister couldn't see.

I barfed up water and could have died from infection but I got lucky I guess since I didn't tell anyone so I wouldn't get in trouble. I'm told it helps it was salt water tho."	1dxddoc	i drowned myself so a hot life gaurd would hold me	"so this happened when i was  i think i could always swim and i went to vacation with friends family

33	When I was a kid I stole my neighbour's bra and burried it	When I was 11, my neighbor was a friendly teacher. We played an adventure game, exploring behind apartments for discarded items. One day, we found a purple bra and some clothes drying from her window. We played with it, helicoptering and burying it. A week later, we tried to make her clothes fall but failed. Eventually, we got another white bra, played with it, and buried it without stealing anything else. Now, I feel guilty for taking from her. Five years later, she got married and moved out. Whenever she saw my mom or sister, she asked about my politeness. Recently, I saw her again; she was cheerful and kind. I still feel guilty about the theft.	1dwx93v	when i was a kid i stole my neighbours bra and burried it	when i was  my neighbor was a friendly teacher we played an adventure game exploring behind apartments for discarded items one day we found a purple bra and some clothes drying from her window we played with it helicoptering and burying it a week later we tried to make her clothes fall but failed eventually we got another white bra played with it and buried it without stealing anything else now i feel guilty for taking from her five years later she got married and moved out whenever she saw my mom or sister she asked about my politeness recently i saw her again she was cheerful and kind i still feel guilty about the theft	dwxv

36	I stole a cab ride and ran off without ever paying the driver	"Now, hear me out. This was back when I was a freshman in college, up in Northern California (when I'd lived in Southern California my whole life until that point).
I had taken city transit to the mall, where I applied for jobs at several retails outlets (I didn't have a car yet). Well, you can guess where this goes.. by the time my final job interview ended, the mall was getting ready to close up. I believe it must have been right around 7, and I went across the parking lot for some dinner at Taco Bell (first mistake). 
Well, after eating, I looked at the bus route catalogue, only to realize that- gasp!- the last bus for the day had already picked up people from the mall stop...
This was almost 15 years ago now (yeeesh, crazy to consider that), back when cell phones were more or less in their infancy, and I believe mine didn't have internet on it. Regardless, it died on me mere moments after I was figuring out who I should call, and so I was forced to use the pay phone just outside of Taco Bell (thankfully, I still had a couple quarters from a laundry run that afternoon). 

A local cab company had posted a sticker with its phone number on the pay phone unit, and so I called the number, gave the guy on the other line my location, and waited for a pick up.

This was a long time ago, and I don't remember everything. What I do remember is how nice the guy who picked me up was, and that he was playing ""The Gorillaz"" on the radio. I also recall thinking to myself, ""please stop talking to me, be mean or something,"" so that I wouldn't feel like such a shmuck for what I knew I was gonna do when he dropped me off...

Now, though I was still wet behind the ears, I had some street smarts. There was no way I was going to give him the address to my dorms, and so instead I directed him to a frat house about a mile from the dormitories (I don't remember how I gave him the address or even how I knew it; I believe I just randomly said an address number for a street I was familiar with).

As soon as Dude stopped the car, I told him I had to go inside to get the money from my mom. That may sound silly now, but at the time, not every transaction was expected to be done through Credit Card or Apple pay.

He acknowledged me, and before I had time to read his reaction to my bullshit further, I opened the door to see a big ass party going on. Yeah- like my mom was really in there. 

Realizing how obvious it was becoming that I was full of it, I didn't waste any more time- I straight booked it. I ran down the sidewalk towards a back alley, heading the opposite direction that the cab was faced, hoping the chaos would shield me from the cab driver having sight on where I was headed as he'd have to spin the car around and still keep track of me among all the party-goers goofing off and drinking in the front yard.

The cab did follow me, but because there were several other parties going on at the block, and the alley I ran into served as the backyard driveway area for many of the houses there, I was able to tuck myself behind a car, and eventually watch the cab pass. Several minutes later, good gosh I was scared as shit, but I was able to slink and maneuver my way out of the area and then take the bike path back towards my dormitories.

I never saw the cab driver again. After all these years, I don't think he'll ever get his $48.75. But, man, those were some great Gorillaz songs.

this was a long time ago and i dont remember everything what i do remember is how nice the guy who picked me up was and that he was playing the gorillaz on the radio i also recall thinking to myself please stop talking to me be mean or something so that i wouldnt feel like such a shmuck for what i knew i was gonna do when he dropped me off

now though i was still wet behind the ears i had some street smarts there was no way i was going to give him the address to my dorms and so instead i directed him to a frat house about a mile from the dormitories i dont remember how i gave him the address or even how i knew it i believe i just randomly said an address number for a street i was familiar with

as soon as dude stopped the car i told him i had to go inside to get the money from my mom that may sound silly now but at the time not every transaction was expected to be done through credit card or apple pay

he acknowledged me and before i had time to read his reaction to my bullshit further i opened the door to see a big ass party going on yeah like my mom was really in there 

realizing how obvious it was becoming that i was full of it i didnt waste any more time i straight booked it i ran down the sidewalk towards a back alley heading the opposite direction that the cab was faced hoping the chaos would shield me from the cab driver having sight on where i was headed as hed have to spin the car around and still keep track of me among all the partygoers goofing off and drinking in the front yard

the cab did follow me but because there were several other parties going on at the block and the alley i ran into served as the backyard driveway area for many of the houses there i was able to tuck myself behind a car and eventually watch the cab pass several minutes later good gosh i was scared as shit but i was able to slink and maneuver my way out of the area and then take the bike path back towards my dormitories

i never saw the cab driver again after all these years i dont think hell ever get his  but man those were some great gorillaz songs "	dvklb
37	I faked before someone else for nearly 2 years. I'm not sure why	"I'm on my alt account so I can't be traced on my main socials. Time and time again I often find myself faking entire personalities online, completely different to my actually irl one for months at a time. (I'm a 18yr old f, whos life is fucking boring compared to what I'm about to share, take what I just said with a grain of salt considering the nature of this confession)
The first one I ever did was 4 years ago and it was a 16 yr old girl with a history of sexual abuse, I dragged on this persona on discord to over 5 people for a whole year solid and while this was going on I make another account on discord and faked being someones girlfriend, 2 months after both of those wrapped up and I moved on by deleting the accounts and moving to insta where I pretended to be a 26 yr old with a wife and newborn, that one only lasted 8 months overall there's alot nitty gritty detail I cant put into words and many more personas ive ""adopted"", ive done some fucked up things over the years with some of these my first one was in my opinion the worst one I've done-rather not admit to what I've done on that account it was never illegal just really morally messed up, I've gone from discord to insta and now reddit and im not sure why i do it. And even now my current persona on my main account is of a suicidal girl who works in college, is 19, has a girlfriend and has her own appartment. I did take a ""break"" from the whole faking things after my last one which was 7/8 months ago.
I don't understand why I keep returning to such a fantasy worlds were I hurt people, good people over and over and mess with there feelings and fake some fucked up situations and taking months to execute a main point to these persons over the years.
Sorry about the awful wording but I'd be happy to talk more in the comments or DMS, I want answers as to why I can't resist the urge to happily slip into a different personality and feel relatively no guilt to any harmful things I did to over 30 people some people clocked on pretty fast as I sometimes just rushed the set up and personality (idk what to call them, persona? Personality). Being honest I feel a good when I do these things tbh, I feel apart of me has been soothed until I have to eventually go back in and fake more of the same persona or make a completey new one. As I mentioned before I'd like to know more about why I do what I do. Maybe there's some genuine reasons or I'm actually of my rocks."	1dvio85	i faked before someone else for nearly  years im not sure why	"im on my alt account so i cant be traced on my main socials time and time again i often find myself faking entire personalities online completely different to my actually irl one for months at a time im a yr old f whos life is fucking boring compared to what im about to share take what i just said with a grain of salt considering the nature of this confession

38	"I went crazy and threw 2 glass cups at a ""customer"""	"I work for my family's business, a small coffee shop. We have a rule of toilet only for customers. We used to be very lenient and let everyone go but that translated into a 2k water bill per month so now we're more strict, although we let anyone who asks nicely go anyway. 

Anyways, today I was closing the shop on my own when I saw this dude near the door but he ran off when I saw him. I continued cleaning and when I looked up again, the dude ran inside straight to the bathroom, no hello no nothing. I called out to him and told him he can't use the bathroom unless he buys something first. He refused, made up excuses, just wouldn't take no for an answer and totally disregarded me and continued his way to the bathroom. 

I saw red. I felt so disrespected and anger took over my body. I happened to have two glass cups in my hands and threw them at him. Luckily for him, my aim is sh*t and didn't hit him. But it was enough to scare him off.

I wish I had sweared at him but I was so angry I couldn't think of insults. 

Now that I'm calmer, I regret it. I think he deserves the scare but I still shouldn't have done that. And more importantly, we are running out of cups and I break two on purpose. 

I won't tell why family about this incident and I'm gonna make up some lie about the broken cups. I KNOW what I did is totally crazy and I shouldn't have done it. But sadly, I act on emotion far more than I should.

39	Bought a Meta Quest 3 just for AR-xxx and returned it	"I need to confess something that’s been on my mind.

A couple of months ago, I bought a Meta Quest 3 from an electronics store that offers a 50-day return policy. I was really curious about AR and had heard great things about it. But to be honest, I had one specific use in mind.

I used it exclusively for AR porn. And it was absolutely mind-blowing. The level of immersion was like nothing I had ever experienced before. For almost 50 days, that’s all I used it for.

Returning it was always part of my plan. It was way too expensive for me to keep. So, right before the 50 days were up, I factory reset the Meta Quest 3, packed it up, and returned it. Got my full refund, no questions asked.

Here’s the part that’s been bugging me: I know they don’t refurbish these returns. They just resell them. So now I can’t stop thinking about the poor person who’s going to buy it next, with no clue what it was used for before. I didn’t feel guilty at all while I was using it or planning to return it, but now I do feel a bit bad for the next owner.

So yeah, that’s my confession. It feels good to get it out there, but I still can’t help but feel a bit guilty for whoever ends up with that Meta Quest 3 next."	1dveedv	bought a meta quest  just for arxxx and returned it	"i need to confess something thats been on my mind

40	I tell customers at my work that I’m dyslexic because I can’t count	"I am literally just stupid. Like really fckn dumb. When I’m cashing someone out and then they decide to go “oh wait I have 68 cents”, my brain turns off and I can’t do the math. I don’t want to pull out my calculator either. 
I often say “oh sorry I can’t add that change in because the system needs to count every coin/bill”… not true. 
Other times they go to hand me the change and then I freeze and look confused. The customer can tell and is able to tell me exactly what I need to give them back and I just go “oh sorry I’m dyslexic!”
I usually just go off of what the customer tells me and pray they’re not ripping me off and as soon as they leave I double check with my calculator. 
I hate to fake a disability but the absolute embarrassment and harassment I get from some of these customers is excruciating. When I tell them I’m dyslexic they kind of relax a little bit and apologize for being rude. 
I have actually gotten to the point of almost crying because I’m so stupid and can’t count change.

41	In CE2 I made a dangerous drink and made a majority of my class drink it.	"You are faced with my story with strange questions about me... 
It all started at the start of CE2 year, I was so happy to start a new school. I met a girl, we'll name her Marie (for reasons of confidentiality), Marie and I were very good friends over the months, we both did a lot of things and above all we loved a thing was the Charmed series.
One day, we said to ourselves, why not try it for real. That's when we want to create a love filter (we don't judge lol). Once home, I took a bottle of coke and started adding water; blue ink; rose petals; bleach; toothpaste; cough syrup etc... The next day, I showed the drink to Marie, she told me to meet at 10 a.m. at recess. 
At 10 a.m., some students from the class came up to us to ask if it really worked. I gave the first sip to a boy I liked, thinking it would work. The whole class started to take my bottle to drink it at the end there was more than half left... It was then that the supervisor came towards us and asked us what it was, I told her that it was was a drink my dad gave me for the day (yes I was stupid), she took the drink and she started to smell. I ended up in the office of my teacher who was the principal of the school. she started calling my father and mother (who were separated) my mother looked at me askance and my father in work clothes looked at me accusingly. When we got home my parents argued and my father ended up making me make a mouthwash with the rest of the drink which cost me 1 week off work and 5 days of blue tongue.

42	I Have Manipulated People To Not Be Seen As A Disappointment 	"I don’t know how to start this off other than providing some context. I’m an 18 year old guy, generally was considered a smart kid, got awarded multiple district level awards for my grades, if that even matters. I had a lot of expectations on me that I couldn’t live up to. I feel like finally being honest now. The only way I got through the last few months of school was through manipulation and lies. I feel a bad for it because I caused stress, however it did work out greatly in my favour. 

So, how this started was I relapsed hard into my depression. Most of my courses were online except for one. I didn’t have a choice but to attend that one. The others I’d skip out on a bit, mostly due to wanting nothing more but to not exist. As you could imagine after a while teachers start sending emails to your parents and principal about missing assignments. My mom, being the good mother she is, nudged me to get the assignments in. Assignments that I didn’t have done. I lied and said the assignments were done but because our internet sucks they didn’t go through. I stuck with this lie for 3 months. 

I was working on the assignments the best I could. I did get them all submitted before the final deadline. However I for some reason decided it would be worth it to spend my little energy on keeping up my lies. I stayed consistent with the story, updating it as it progressed. The worst but best thing I did was use my mental health crisis to keep things under my control. At one point my mom got suspicious and wanted to check my progress. Obviously I didn’t get too far so I diverted that plan by telling her about my relapse. It got me the help I desperately needed as I was becoming suicidal. I only regret the other motives behind that move. It did buy me time to finish my work, it did get me help, but it was done for entirely selfish reasons. 

I regret this because it showed me something horrible about myself. I had manipulative tendencies before, just not like that. Not for 3 whole months and not with multiple people involved. Never with that amount of intent either. What I did was gain the ability to lie confidently, control people, and to not feel too bad as long as it went as planned. I acted out of fear of disappointing everyone and did something that was worse. I fear what I could become if I let this fester. I should’ve just been honest from the start.

43	I am hiding my child from my father and family for 2 years 	"Hi all,

So for some context while  trying to stay anon, I'm a 21M from Canada, I come from a desi-muslim immigrant family, my parents are separated since young, and my dad lives in the states. Both of my parents remarried.

When I was 18 years old, I got a girl pregnant that I been screwing around with for almost a year at the time (yes we used protection but it broke and by the time we noticed, it was too late), plan B pill was used which also failed. I obviously never wanted to have a child not at least until I was established, and at first she agreed to an abortion but once her family found out, they convinced her to keep it and so she did and obviously there was nothing i can do.

I've only told my mom and that's it. I feel too embarrassed to tell anyone, not even my step father who lives with me knows. I just felt like a huge disappointment because my parents fought with blood and tears to come to this country and give me a better life, just for me to screw myself over like this.. Not to mention my whole family is very judgmental and ""gossipy"" type and also muslim.

Fast-forward to the present, I am involved in my child's life and have a good relationship with the mom. Yet I am still hiding it (I say ""it"" so I don't disclose the gender). I know I can't keep doing this forever, but I was planning to reveal it to everyone once I finish school/and or have a career going for myself. I just feel like it's bad that I have a child, I can't even support on my own. As far as my other family knowing or my step-father, i really don't care for. But my bio dad has the right to know he has a grandchild.

The thing is my dad has two little toddlers of his own, and they're only 1-2 years older than my child, and I have a bit of a rocky relationship with my father. He left us when I was a toddler, and was barely present in most of my life. Althought we have a decent relationship for the last 5 years now, he is a very ""Education/career first, kids and marriage later (not until like 30)"" type of guy. He already thinks I'm a fuckup because I took 2 gap years after graduating high school. He's very successful and has high expectations of me.

Nonetheless I know it's wrong to hide my child from him but I just can't get over how to tell him. Do I tell him in person when I go visit? do I tell him through the phone?"	1dtf39y	i am hiding my child from my father and family for  years 	"hi all

45	I (25m) Was pushy with a good female friend while drunk	"I recently went out with a female friend and was very drunk. She said that she’d been finding me attractive and I said that we should have sex. She responded with “I don’t think it’s a good idea” and “I’ll regret it tomorrow” and I kept pushing the subject for way longer than I should have. We then went to play darts and I put my hands on her waist. We ended up walking back and I apologized for being so pushy on it and realized I was not in my right mind and that I’d been such a freak. Nothing else happened however. It is no excuse but I was so drunk that I can’t even remember most of the details just the gist of it.

The next day, she asked that we meet up to talk she very coldly ended our friendship. I feel like such a rapey freak and I regret it so much. She was a very important part of my life and I burned the friendship for something that I dont even want now that Im sober. I’m having a lot of trouble coming to terms with my actions and that our friendship is over. I apologized and made sure she was okay but am respecting her wishes of no contact. I just feel like I’m a terrible person and I hate myself for ruining one of the post important friendships in my life right now 

Edit: grammar 

Edit 2: Thanks for the advice everybody so far. I think that I have made a mistake that can’t be fixed in this situation. I hope she decides we can move forward, but I know her and her conviction is one of her most admirable traits. When she ended our friendship, she said that she believes that people who are capable of this, are capable of it whether they’re drunk or not. And I know I would never have done something like this sober but I respect her opinion on that front. 

Maybe in a months time I will message her to try and reconnect but I’d like to know opinions on that I suppose. I don’t want to seem pushy, she knew I had a crush on her for a long time before this. Anyway, I truly truly appreciate all the responses

46	I stole my mom’s credit card when I was 10, got away with it	Self-explanatory title but I’ll elaborate. When I was 10 I was REALLY into Minecraft, I particularly enjoyed playing on the server hypixel- where they have a number of “ranks” you can pay for to unlock additional features to enhance your gaming experience. I desperately wanted a rank on the server, but my parents weren’t interested in funding my gaming addiction (for entirely fair reasons) so when I realized my mom’s card information was saved onto the computer I did some devious investigating. I was certain there’d be an extra security question and that the charge wouldn’t go through, I was really only half joking to myself as I messed around thinking “wouldn’t it be funny if this worked though” and next thing I know I had a rank on hypixel. As a 10 year-old, the ease of that transaction bestowed upon me a dark power I didn’t know how to handle. Not long after, I maxed out my rank on the server and showed it off to my online friends (I didn’t have many real ones at the time). Being eager to impress and unaware of the consequences of my actions, I offered to share in my newfound glory, asking all of my online crew if they wanted ranks too. Some of them even said I didn’t need to do that, but I insisted. $130 later my mom saw the charge on her bank statement. I denied my involvement adamantly and just burst into tears as I was entirely unprepared to face the music. I was probed with questions that I either avoided or vaguely answered until my family conjured a story to explain what had happened. They eventually decided not that I was a stupid child that did a bad thing, but that I’d been HACKED by one of my online friends. Obviously I knew this wasn’t true, but I went along with it because the truth was infinitely more humiliating. It wasn’t an entirely impossible explanation either, I would message one of these friends on Skype so it wouldn’t have been a stretch to imagine that I could’ve accidentally offered too much personal information in conversation or otherwise. My mom contacted the server moderators to refund the charge, but as part of their policy my account was banned from the server, and presumably all of my online friends by extension (I’m not sure, I never dared to talk to them again). After a lecture on internet safety and stranger danger life moved on and I’ve only ever disclosed my sins to one other person. When I think about it now I’m not sure if I believe I actually got away with it, or if my parents saw how distraught I was and decided to spare me the confrontation by creating an alternative explanation- 10 years later I still haven’t asked and don’t plan to. I haven’t done anything similar since as I still definitely learned my lesson (the guilt haunted me for years), but now when there’s something I want online, at least I’m a grown adult who can pay for it himself.	1dsf6wk	i stole my moms credit card when i was  got away with it	selfexplanatory title but ill elaborate when i was  i was really into minecraft i particularly enjoyed playing on the server hypixel where they have a number of ranks you can pay for to unlock additional features to enhance your gaming experience i desperately wanted a rank on the server but my parents werent interested in funding my gaming addiction for entirely fair reasons so when i realized my moms card information was saved onto the computer i did some devious investigating i was certain thered be an extra security question and that the charge wouldnt go through i was really only half joking to myself as i messed around thinking wouldnt it be funny if this worked though and next thing i know i had a rank on hypixel as a  yearold the ease of that transaction bestowed upon me a dark power i didnt know how to handle not long after i maxed out my rank on the server and showed it off to my online friends i didnt have many real ones at the time being eager to impress and unaware of the consequences of my actions i offered to share in my newfound glory asking all of my online crew if they wanted ranks too some of them even said i didnt need to do that but i insisted  later my mom saw the charge on her bank statement i denied my involvement adamantly and just burst into tears as i was entirely unprepared to face the music i was probed with questions that i either avoided or vaguely answered until my family conjured a story to explain what had happened they eventually decided not that i was a stupid child that did a bad thing but that id been hacked by one of my online friends obviously i knew this wasnt true but i went along with it because the truth was infinitely more humiliating it wasnt an entirely impossible explanation either i would message one of these friends on skype so it wouldnt have been a stretch to imagine that i couldve accidentally offered too much personal information in conversation or otherwise my mom contacted the server moderators to refund the charge but as part of their policy my account was banned from the server and presumably all of my online friends by extension im not sure i never dared to talk to them again after a lecture on internet safety and stranger danger life moved on and ive only ever disclosed my sins to one other person when i think about it now im not sure if i believe i actually got away with it or if my parents saw how distraught i was and decided to spare me the confrontation by creating an alternative explanation  years later i still havent asked and dont plan to i havent done anything similar since as i still definitely learned my lesson the guilt haunted me for years but now when theres something i want online at least im a grown adult who can pay for it himself	dsfwk
47	I lied about my age to a group of adults and I’m just now getting ready to confess this to them.	"Hi, I’m not going to take up too much time writing this. Or maybe I will idk. I’m ashamed. I met them on a game, all of them, even the ones that left the group due to conflicts and unfortunately I was in fact part of said conflict. It was the first time in my life I ever felt appreciated, I felt like they were my family and it hurts even worse when I hear them refer to me as family. It has almost been a year. I told them I had just turned 17 when I met them. It was a lie, Because I don’t know? I had already built connections with them? They assume I’m turning 18, I feel like shit, I’m turning 17. I don’t know why I did what I did. I just wanted some friends, I’m truly sorry. I know the two of you still sue Reddit sometimes, I never really used it. You both said I was like a brother to you and I am sorry that I have deceived you. 

I truly just wanted someone to relate to, if you don’t understand that’s fine to, I was so happy that I found people who understood exactly how my brain functioned and i could express my ideas about my characters and how their little universes worked to you both. I’m sorry to say that I will have to just erase myself from social media, I don’t know if I can face you like the confident  young man I claimed to be, and instead I will just disappear.

49	i take ozempic even though i'm skinny and non-diabetic	"i've dealt with body image issues and eating disorders for years, basically since i was a young teenager. even though my mental health has improved since then, i work in the modeling industry, and i have to think about my body and what i eat constantly. 

last year, i moved to a different country, where ozempic is very cheap and much more easily accessible than in america (where i grew up). i ended up buying one syringe, mostly out of curiousity-- and it worked like magic. it's been about a month, and i've lost 4kgs. for reference, i started out at 52kg (170cm), which is fairly skinny for my height. but i've wanted to be 43kgs for so many years, tried a million diets and exercise regiments and therapy, and have not been able to reach this goal. 

being on ozempic is like a dream, and i am so endlessly grateful that it works for me. not just because i lose weight (which, granted, is a huge plus), but because i am not thinking about food CONSTANTLY. this has been a huge problem for me for years, always thinking about food or eating or not eating, feeling guilt or intense hunger or self hatred.
 
i swear, after one week, those thoughts went from an 8/10 to a 1/10. i feel so much happier than i've ever been. i eat enough to fuel my body and my energy, but not so much that i am maintaining my usual weight. 

i don't know how long i'll continue it. i know that it's quite controversial in the US because there's a shortage for people with diabetes who need it. but in my country, it's not in demand at all-- it's easy for pretty much anyone to get, if you're willing to pay for it. 

i know that it might not be the best for my health, but i'm the happiest i've been in years. i haven't told my family or any of my friends except 2, because i don't know how guilty i should feel. i guess i wanted to submit this to relieve some of that feeling.

51	Had someone walk out without paying at work and now I'm panicking	"A few days ago I was bagging a customers groceries when a regular came up and started talking to me. I was supposed to be finishing the transaction that was in front of me, but instead I ended up talking to the regular. After both had already walked away I realized that the customer hadn't paid. I walked over to the pinpad and instead of checking to see if they just hadn't finished the transaction on their end I accidentally cancelled the payment.

I don't know if they stuck their card in, but if they did and didn't finish it I had no way of trying to process the payment because I had cancelled it out instead of checking first. I was so shocked because I had never gotten a walk out before and I'd worked here for 2 years. It was $85 and my card was upstairs. I suspended the order and was planning on getting my card to pay for it when I went on my last break because I was so scared of what my managers were going to say.

I forgot that they could also see suspended orders so shortly after I did it, my manager radioed me asking where the order went. I panicked and told her that the customer went back into the store to buy more items and that I was holding onto it until they came back. She got angry- rightfully- because I should have held the items at the front instead of letting them go back into the store. She cancelled our the order on her end.

I'm not sure why I lied because if someone finds out I'm going to be in a whole hell of a lot more trouble than I was having just told the truth. I really like this job, I really don't want to lose it. I'm so scared that when I go back in tomorrow that I'm going to get written up or fired. I generally don't lie, so I feel disgusted that that was my first instinct instead of admitting that I had fucked up the order. This guilt is eating at me and I just feel disgusting for doing something like that.

Edit: I feel like I need to add that I was NOT at a traditional register. I was operating a part of our self checkout called ""Flex"" where the customer scans their own items and I bag for them. What is the point of Flex? Our traditional self checkout is 10 items or less, this expands it to 25 or less because there is a belt and a bagger for the customer. Flex at my store is two lanes, side by side. At the end- where I bag- there are two large screens so we can assist the customer without having to move from bagging. There is only one bagger for both registers. The right hand register is where the regular showed up, he bought a bag of chips. We started talking about how good the chips were considering they are not a name brand and they are a strange flavor. The customer on the left was the one whose payment didn't finalize. We- regular and I- talked with this customer too, talked about the chips, about how he was doing, whether he liked the store or not- it was his first time in- we gave him suggestions for store brand items and we also briefly talked about the 4th of July and the cupcakes he was buying. In total, I talked to both customers for 5-10 minutes before the customer left and I realized that they hadn't paid. So I was NOT standing there talking with a regular customer and not helping the person who left without finalizing their payment, I was talking with both customers and was not paying attention to the transaction."	1dqdmi4	had someone walk out without paying at work and now im panicking	"a few days ago i was bagging a customers groceries when a regular came up and started talking to me i was supposed to be finishing the transaction that was in front of me but instead i ended up talking to the regular after both had already walked away i realized that the customer hadnt paid i walked over to the pinpad and instead of checking to see if they just hadnt finished the transaction on their end i accidentally cancelled the payment

52	In highschool, I scratched up my car on another kids car backing out of a parking spot	"When I was in highschool (~10 years ago) I had a car my parents rented. One day, when the parking lot was covered in snow, I was backing out of my parking spot to go home and felt my car starting to slide and make a skidding noise.

I thought I was stuck on a patch of ice or snow so I pressed the pedal harder hoping to get unstuck. Finally, I was able to get out and I went home. Days later my Mom saw scratch marks on the front side of my car and was pissed that someone must have hit my car (their car rented for me). I realized then that front right of my car must have been skidding along the side of the parked car next to me.

I think I subconsciously suppressed this possibility at the time and blamed the snow in my head so I wouldn't have to feel guilty or get in trouble for scratching someone's car. Back then I was younger and really scared of conflict so I didn't want to admit it, but now that I'm older I definitely did minor damage to that car (at least to the paint or something).

I've never told anyone this but I sure hope the damage wasn't too noticeable on their car and they were able to buff it out, hopefully for cheap enough. I never did manage to find their car again. It was white and my highschool had quite a lot of students with cars, many of them white. I didn't know what model it was. Sorry to whoever's car this was!"	1dprezt	in highschool i scratched up my car on another kids car backing out of a parking spot	"when i was in highschool  years ago i had a car my parents rented one day when the parking lot was covered in snow i was backing out of my parking spot to go home and felt my car starting to slide and make a skidding noise

58	Lied to parents about what university program I enrolled in	"I just want to preface that I never wanted to go to University. I hated studying throughout high school, but I'm Asian and my parents sort of forced me to go to University. And the story starts here...

I never really knew what I wanted to do with my career and my parents suggested that I go into uni to study computer science. I thought why not, I'm a huge computer nerd and I might like computer science. So, I managed to get an offer for computer science from a top tier uni. In my first year I realized that this field is not for me. My grades were so horrible in a first year computer science course that I had to drop it. I didn't want to tell my parents because I was so ashamed and I couldn't just drop out of uni or transfer to an easier uni because they would eventually find out since they were paying for my tuition. So I decided to switch majors and chose Applied Statistics and mathematics. I actually enjoyed taking the courses within these majors and my grades were actually really good. So good that I made it onto the Honor Roll for my 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year and made it onto the Dean's list in my 3rd and 4th year.

Fast forward to June 2024, I've graduated with my Bachelor's and now I'm applying to jobs. I'm mostly looking for data analysis positions, but lying to my parents that I'm looking for software engineering positions. Everybody (including my parents) knows that the job market now is bad and it's not that odd to my parents that I haven't secured a position. The issue from this is, my parents are introducing me to their friends and distant relatives who have a career in software engineering. Notably, today they got in touch with my uncle who's a technical manager. They asked me to send my resume to him so he can use his connections to help me land a job in software engineering. Now I'm afraid that my uncle will see through all my lies and expose it to my parents. I don't have any relevant professional experience within software engineering NOR applied statistics because I was too focused on getting good grades and making-up courses over the summer because I switched majors after first year.

I know you guys think I should tell my parents the truth but it's more complicated than that because of their attitude. My Dad is a very hard-headed/stubborn guy and is always argumentative. My Mom has too much pride and likes to brag to her friends about me studying computer science at a top tier uni. I think that if I told them the truth, I would very much get kicked out of the house (yes I still live with them).

I've been living in this lie for more than 5 years now and I've always been able to manage it. But since I'm so close to the edge of being exposed I feel like I'm suffocating more than ever. They've always expected me to become a software engineer making 200k/year but in reality I don't mind getting a computer technician job making 50k/year...

TLDR: My parents paid for my tuition and thought I studied computer science when I actually studied applied statistics and math. I didn't study computer science because I failed those courses in first year. If I told them the truth, I think I will get kicked out of the house. Considering today's job market, I'm having a hard time finding a job. My parents wanted to help and recently they got in touch with my uncle who is a technical manager and asked me to send my resume to him. If I send my resume to him, he will see through all my lies and will likely expose me to my parents.

  
Update 1: Spoke with my uncle today and told him the truth. I asked him to keep the conversation between us two and he more than happily agreed. He was very understanding of my situation and said that it was wise for me to pursue something that I'm more passionate about. He gave me tips on how to make myself more competitive in today's market, networking skills, and general life advice.

ive been living in this lie for more than  years now and ive always been able to manage it but since im so close to the edge of being exposed i feel like im suffocating more than ever theyve always expected me to become a software engineer making kyear but in reality i dont mind getting a computer technician job making kyear

tldr my parents paid for my tuition and thought i studied computer science when i actually studied applied statistics and math i didnt study computer science because i failed those courses in first year if i told them the truth i think i will get kicked out of the house considering todays job market im having a hard time finding a job my parents wanted to help and recently they got in touch with my uncle who is a technical manager and asked me to send my resume to him if i send my resume to him he will see through all my lies and will likely expose me to my parents

  
update  spoke with my uncle today and told him the truth i asked him to keep the conversation between us two and he more than happily agreed he was very understanding of my situation and said that it was wise for me to pursue something that im more passionate about he gave me tips on how to make myself more competitive in todays market networking skills and general life advice "	dopyn
59	i'm gifting my best friend a regift for her birthday 	"
my best friend whom i""ve known for 5 years, is having her 16th birthday in a couple days.

my family is really struggling financially, and i can't afford buying anything, so i'm giving her a bracelet i never wore, however she doesn't know that it's a regift. 
honestly i'm not planning to tell her.
i have the box i got the bracelet in, but not the bag, so i'm just gonna put it in another bag
i actually love that bracelet, so it's not like i'm trying to get rid of it, but i still feel guilty bc i lied to her.
i really hope she doesn't notice, but i totally am a shit friend, lol.
there's no gift receipt, i told her that i lost it.

the worth of the bracelet is actually the same amount i would've gave her if i had any money, but in my heart i know that i didn't put in the effort to choose something for her."	1do8ntd	im gifting my best friend a regift for her birthday 	"

66	I joined my bullies, and bullied my best friend out of school	"When I was 11 I moved to a new school. These kids had all known eachother for 6 years. The kids were awful man. It manifested in sly comments and publicly embarassing you and just leaving you out. It was all led by the male teacher in his mid 40s who enjoyed making comments about students to embarass them in front of the class and feel popular. It was a small school and a really strange environment to come into after being in a wholesome primary school.

There was this one girl who was nice to me and for the first 2 months we were each other's only friends in an otherwise miserable place, let's call her Anna. She has big buck teeth and she'd had 0 friends her entire life.

I went home and told my mother often about what was going on at school and one day she decided she'd go right to the principles office and have a chat. I never asked her to do this as I knew it would not be solved this way, considering the ring leader was my teacher. 

Well, it went bad.

So the male teacher pulled me and the two worst girls into his tiny office and basically told them my mother had gone to the principle and accused them of bullying me, and asked them to explain themselves. Everything inside that office after that moment I can't remember. It was so stressful. 
The next thing I remember is he lets us go outside all together and these two girls corner me and demand I explain myself. 

At this point they knew Anna and I were friends, the week before she'd invited me to her house for her birthday (the first time she'd ever had a friend at her birthday).

I don't know why but I just told them that Anna had a huge problem with them and hated them (and that I didn't know why) and that when I went to her house she'd spoken to my mother. She'd told my mother theyd bullied us, and that my mother was very defensive and crazy so she must have just gone to the principle without asking me first.

For some reason this resonated with them so hard. They really really hated that girl for no reason. So they invited me to sit with them at recess, and when I saw her I just didn't speak to her.

 I never spoke another word to Anna. She must have been so confused and Im sure she never found out what happened. We all agreed to freeze her out. This was my idea, I suggested it so that the truth wouldn't come out. They wanted to confront her but I told them it's more effective if we just dont speak to her.

This shared enemy caused them to accept me and I eventually adapted to the environment and became quite a mean girl myself for a couple of years while I was at that school.

Since all of the girls were freezing out Anna, she switched schools within a month and I was relieved I didn't have to face her anymore.

This is one of my biggest regrets and I'm 24 and still think about it and her often. I don't know why I did it, it's hard to explain how toxic and vitriolic that school was. It wasn't normal."	1dlrenu	i joined my bullies and bullied my best friend out of school	"when i was  i moved to a new school these kids had all known eachother for  years the kids were awful man it manifested in sly comments and publicly embarassing you and just leaving you out it was all led by the male teacher in his mid s who enjoyed making comments about students to embarass them in front of the class and feel popular it was a small school and a really strange environment to come into after being in a wholesome primary school

67	Popped a tire so he wouldn't drive home drunk and pretended it must of been an accident 	"So I'm not proud of this but my drunk brain couldn't think of a better solution on the spot. 

 So I'm at the VFW with my dad and sister, drinking with my dad. He gets pretty drunk and I asked him when he wanted to get going and he said that he'll be good in an hour to drive and that he wants us (sis and me) to follow him. My sister is my DD since she doesn't drink, and she whispers to me that she's worried we won't be good in an hour. So we ask dad to just take a ride with us since my sister lives with my parents and we are just going back to the house. I tell him the car can wait and be picked up tomorrow. He refuses and says he will be fine.

 He's had a crap ton of shots and a good couple drinks and ALARM BELLS are going off to NOT LET HIM DRIVE. I love my dad, but he is so stubborn so I know the only person who can convince him to NOT drive while buzzed or drunk is my mom. Because of this my mom is the only one who drives him home from the VFW, but she's out of town for the next two weeks. 

So I'm like oh shit I need to get other people in on this. I go around asking people we know to get their opinions if he would be okay and they ALL agree he isn't. I tell them I NEED their help to convince my dad to NOT drive. A couple people talk to him and mention ""hey you should let your daughter drive"" and he laughs it off and says he's fine. It was frustrating. 

The only solution we were able to come up with was one person behind him and one person in front of him but my gut is telling me to NOT let him drive.  So I go out to my car (cause I was gonna leave it at the VFW over night) and grab my knife and pop his tire. That was the ONLY solution I could think of. 

End of the night my dad gets in his car, and is about to drive and I go over and I'm like OH NO you have a flat! He is like we can drive to Sheets to get air in it. It took two dudes to convince him to not drive it because the tire was FLAT and he was in denial. He hops into my sister's car bitching about the flat.

 We all got home safe, but I told my sister I popped his tire and she called me immature and excessive. I believe it was excessive but I didn't know what else to do and I was also drunk. I  just didn't wanna lose my Dad to something I could have prevented. So was I wrong? I just want my dad to be safe, and I wish he would take it more seriously. 

Edit: I've received a lot of comments saying I should of just let the air out instead of puncturing the tire so I want to clarify a couple things. 1. I also was drunk so I wasn't thinking clearly. 2. Even if I did think to let the air out that means I would of had to have pressed down on the valve which can be time consuming. I would if most likely been caught doing so and I knew we were planning on leaving in about 20 mins. 3. I tried to make the puncture wound tiny as possible to make it look like something else may have gotten to it, but my inebriated brain had poor judgement so it came out to an one inch slash. 

Edit 2: A lot of people have been asking why didn't I just trick him into giving me his keys, and for those who have experience with drunk people know why and thank you for saying so in the comments. For those who don't know, trying to take keys from a drunk person who thinks they are confident enough to drive is the equivalent of trying to take a ball away from a golden retriever, near impossible. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time this has happened. Seven years ago when he came to visit me when I lived in Florida, we got pretty drunk with my friends. At the end of the night he tried to drive home drunk which surprised me because this was the first time I've ever gotten drunk with my dad and thought he was smarter than that. It took me and seven of my friends to take away his keys which only happened because one of them was brave enough to tackle my dad and grab them. I had to call my mom and put her on the phone with my dad and that was the only way he calmed down enough to take a taxi home. He didn't talk to me for two days because even after he sobered up, he was still convinced he would of been fine. 

So, I wasn't about to try that again the other night. Yes, I now realize he needs help. I've been away from home the last four years and came home in 2022. Since I've been home, there wasn't any indication he would be dumb enough to do something like that again, but now I realize my mom has been home majority of that time frame to probably keep him in check.  

Edit 3: VFW stands for Veterans of Foreign War and is a club for military vets and their spouses, and family members. My mom is the veteran.

UPDATE: So I forgot that the VFW has security cameras and although my intention was to replace the tires I realized I had to replace them before my dad noticed that it was slashed. Things didn't work out as planned since we all woke up around the same time. My sister and I tried to ditch my dad before he had the chance to notice but caught us.

 So we went to breakfast together then went over to the VFW to grab our cars. He has a portable air compressor so his plan was to just reinflate when we got there but obviously that didn't work. He started kussing up a storm when he noticed that the tire was slashed and my sister decided to take him back home. 

 As fate would had it, he decided he didn't want to mess around with it and decided to nap. Which gave me enough time to go back to the car with a jack and take the tire off, run over to get a new tire and put it back on. My sister helped me throughout the entire process and thank God she did because taking off the old tire was tough! Had to jump on the tire iron to loosen the bolts. Anyways, she drove the car home before my dad could wake up from his nap. 

He obviously was confused why I replaced the tire and just told him I wanted to help him out. He thanked me and said he would pay me back, but I don't plan on accepting it. I'm waiting for my mom to return from being out of town so we can all be together when I tell my Dad the truth and hopefully she will back me up. I just hope my Dad doesn't decide to go through the security footage before she gets back. 

UPDATE 2: So, my Dad ended up going through the security footage and found out it was me. He wasn't mad as I thought he would of been, but I'm not sure how to respond. This is what he ended up texting me. 

""I'm very shocked after I reviewed the video from Friday at the club. Now I know why you were so converned with replacing my tire. What the hell. If you believe someone shouldn't drive, there would have been many other options. I had a gummy and only had a few drinks and a couple of shots over five hours, normally that would just be me warming up. So I guess me having a great night, you assumed I was drunk. I have a very high tolerance. So I will put this event behind me.""

I'm not sure how to respond to this becasue 1. I know it was more than a few and he had two shots and two drinks within the last hour. 2. Him having a gummy and drunk probably won't do him any favors behind the wheel. and 3. I feel like I tried other options that night but he obviously he thought he was fine. 

I'm tempted just to tell him that I won't pop another tire again as long as he doesn't argue with me when I ask him to have my sister and I take him home instead. However I know he won't take this as seriously. Any ideas how to respond?

68	I stole a 50ml bottle of whiskey from an airplane. 	So, my girlfriend and I flew to a country with a terrible airline. They set out on their mandatory stroll with a little trolley filled with nuts, beer, and tea. Someone made a purchase or made a fuss on the other aisle, two seats back, which caused the flight attendants to look over there for 5 seconds, leaving the trolley unprotected. I stole a red label whiskey and concealed it in my jacket. I'm 21 years old. Will they get in trouble for it? Because there is always pandemonium on the flight, I doubt they check inventories rather than refill.	1dllhkn	i stole a ml bottle of whiskey from an airplane 	so my girlfriend and i flew to a country with a terrible airline they set out on their mandatory stroll with a little trolley filled with nuts beer and tea someone made a purchase or made a fuss on the other aisle two seats back which caused the flight attendants to look over there for  seconds leaving the trolley unprotected i stole a red label whiskey and concealed it in my jacket im  years old will they get in trouble for it because there is always pandemonium on the flight i doubt they check inventories rather than refill	dllhkn

70	A boy stole my ipod so I ‘hacked’ his account and got him taken out of school	"When I was in 7th grade, a boy I was friends with told me he had math test but forgot his calculator and asked to borrow my ipod. I said sure, but when I went to go get it at the end of the day he never showed up. The next week he still never showed up. After the second week I asked the school office for his mom’s phone number and called her saying that he took my ipod but didn’t give it back and the next day she dropped it off in the office. When I took it home it had all of his accounts logged in, the wallpaper was changed and all his contacts were in it. I wanted to get revenge so I went on his Facebook and changed his profile picture and cover photo to pictures of porn, and made posts about how much he hated his mom and his religion (they were very religious, I knew this would get him into trouble). 

Apparently from that moment his mom decided to take him out of the school and homeschool him because he was troubled (although there were other external reasons too), and he was also paranoid for years about being hacked online. I talked to him once years later and he brought up unprovoked about using fake names online because of someone hacking his account in 7th grade. No one ever found out it was me and he never even suspected me. I still feel bad and not sure why I even did it.

71	I let my friend who doesn’t have a license drive my car.	"My friend (19) and I (18) in currently on a road trip. Early this morning, I began driving to our next destination. About 10 minutes into the drive, I began to feel the incredibly lightheaded, nauseous and my fingers were going numb.

My friend offered to drive me while avoiding highways. So he drove 4 hours without a license on the country roads. 

I just feel like an idiot for breaking a very simple law; have a fucking license. What if we had been pulled over? I can’t stop ruminating about this, please talk some sense into me."	1dlgkr1	i let my friend who doesnt have a license drive my car	"my friend  and i  in currently on a road trip early this morning i began driving to our next destination about  minutes into the drive i began to feel the incredibly lightheaded nauseous and my fingers were going numb

72	lied and used a person for a while and then lied to get out of it	"i didn't start using them right away but i had inserted lies throughout the duration of knowing this person. id make up a bunch of people that didnt exist just cause. i didnt really have a good reason for it, i just felt like doing it at the time i guess. i had made up a bunch of random things because in the moment it just worked for me.

we had a pretty fucked up relationship and they had been pretty abusive to me before i started using them and then one day i just- started doing it.

i did it for a while on and off just to get free food/random things or company when i was bored. they were pretty inexpensive. eventually i was only doing it like a twice or three times a month at most- i had began to realize how shitty what i had was and felt pretty bad about it. i tried to justify it by saying they treated me like shit but i dont really stand by that honestly. i did it because it was convenient to me. for a little while it did feel like revenge though.

i wasnt ever going to come clean about lying but i was going to tie everything off in a clean way and cut contact but then the day i decided to do it, they came to me after coming to the realization that i had lied about a lot of things.  
i panicked and lied even more to save face. not sure why i did it honestly, i was fine with cutting contact at that point but i did it anyway. part of me says i did it to spare them the hurt of feeling used and part of me says i did it just cause i didnt want to be caught.

in any case- they believed my extra round of lying in the end and i managed to tie things off the way i originally intended- albeit kind of shakily. i did end up cutting contact and before i did, it seemed like we were both in a great place in our lives.

ive never used people in my life before this person but i did use them for a WHILE. i made a promise to never lie like that anymore and ive been holding to it with no trouble.

i dont struggle with not lying but i do struggle with my guilt about doing this.   
before i cut contact i did do an umbrella apology for being shitty and hurting them and acknowledging our terrible relationship and we cut contact mutually and peacefully. i just keep thinking back to that moment when they found out and i scrambled to keep the lies together one last time.  
  
figured confession someway somehow might help me.  
  
im no longer that person, im in a very healthy relationship with someone i love dearly and i could never imagine lying to or using them this way. one old lie made its way into our relationship super early on but its a harmless white lie so i just left it be.   
  
i just hope i can get over this. i know im not this person anymore and i know i dont agree with what i did.

73	I was a kleptomaniac and it started as a young child.	"I’m now 25 but I just wanted to come on here and see if I’m not the only person who did this so young and no remorse. 
So when I was around 8 years old my mom manipulated me into stealing my grandpas pain pills and at first I didn’t want to do it but she convinced me and I honestly think that’s when it started. 
He trusted me to give him his medicine so my mom told me when I give it to him take some extra and give them to her. 
I ended up doing this for a while and I feel really bad about it. 
Then one year my grandma was in charge of the fundraiser money for us to go to church camp and I would steal money (that was literally helping my friends and I go on a vacation) not much but a few bucks here and there for candy. 
I stole cash from people who would never think it was me and never confessed. 
Then fast forward to middle school & highschool I would literally steal anything that I wanted. But only if I knew I wouldn’t get caught. I’ve never been caught stealing which is why I think I kept it up. 
I stole a friends iPhone and she gave me her password so we can use find my iPhone and I saved her password so I could reset it. I acted like I got a new phone about two weeks later and hid it until then. 
I’ve stolen from stores literally never paid for makeup until about 2 or 3 years ago. 
I’ve stopped stealing completely for about a year now but since I’ve turned 21 I only stole from stores and not actual people. 
There’s a lot more that I’ve stolen but I feel like those are the worse "	1dkrjql	i was a kleptomaniac and it started as a young child	"im now  but i just wanted to come on here and see if im not the only person who did this so young and no remorse

75	I used a German flag passed down to me by my roommate for nasty stuff	"Me 17m at that time had a roommate 18m from Germany, he really loved his country and I spent an amazing year with him at our boarding school. 

He graduated a year before me and passed down his German flag to me and told me that I’m an honorary german, I felt so proud and really appreciated what he did for me. 

However, three months ago, I was jerking off and ran out of tissues, and guess what, that german flag was the closest thing to a tissue around me, idk I was too lazy to get of my bed and find something else so I grabbed it.

I feel so horrible and guilty like every time I look at that flag I just get ashamed.

76	I pushed my mother during an argument and now I regret it deeply	So a little backstory Here, I was preparing for my college entrance exams for the past two years and wasn't as serious about it as my classmates, right now I got admission in a reputable college and it is well known so that's not so much of a problem. The problem is that my mom used to pester me a lot regarding my studies which I understand, but just at the start of 2024 I got into contact with one of my old friends once more and he too was coincidentally studying for the same exams so I told my mother about this and she and his mom got in touch. This guy had been preparing for these exams for quite some time while I only got serious about it recently and my mother loved to compare us both every fucking waking moment, she used to taunt me so much that it lead to so many arguments. Those arguments were so heated my throat used to hurt the next day from all that shouting. She taunted me and humiliated me by saying that shit in front of my physics teacher, my maths teacher but she was smart enough not to talk about him in front of my father. I used to scream tell her to leave me alone try to make her understand but it didn't work, and that guy is a complete douchebag in real life. I told my mother about this, she wanted me to hangout with him despite me telling her so many times how arrogant and annoying he is but she didn't listen and I lashed out extremely bad, that was on Friday. Our fight was so bad and so much shouting was involved my throat hurt and her stomach started aching the next day which she later blamed me for. Then today on Monday I wanted to talk to her about the college I had gotten and she just dismissed it. Another thing about her is that she is very disrespectful and will NEVER acknowledge it. She talks to me like trash, calls me like some servant from across the house when she has work that needs to be done, she will curse at me when she gets angry but when I reach my breaking point I am a bad son who doesn't know how to talk to his mother. She never accepts her faults. So today we got into the same argument after she again was acting dismissive of my college course for which I will be going out of my city in a month for FIVE years, she just seems so indifferent, not even a single compliment or anything, just picking at my previous mistakes and taunting me that I'll do the same when I go to college. It was all too much for me today, so when she was in my room again today pestering me, I told her to leave multiple times, I was on the verge of crying and threw a pillow at her to get the point across, she just brushed it off and continued. It all became too much to bear and I pushed her and she fell down on the floor. I regretted it so damn much and she was looking at me like I'm some monster, so she started crying and telling me what kind of son ami I to do this and she said to me she wants nothing to do with me and that she should have never given birth to me. She said she didn't want to hear my disgusting voice when I try to justify myself. Keep in mind that this is after I got accepted in a good college with a good course in AI. She has never been appreciative of a single thing and frankly I feel like a monster. I want to commit suicide. I feel like dying and I feel like trash. I am afraid I'll do this and lash out in the same way when I get a girlfriend or a wife and be tagged as an abuser. I have a past of being bullied and I really can't handle being put down like someone pathetic, I feel so bad just thinking about. I never once have put my hands on her and this was the first time I did it in anger, I am not proud of it.	1dkc6v7	i pushed my mother during an argument and now i regret it deeply	so a little backstory here i was preparing for my college entrance exams for the past two years and wasnt as serious about it as my classmates right now i got admission in a reputable college and it is well known so thats not so much of a problem the problem is that my mom used to pester me a lot regarding my studies which i understand but just at the start of  i got into contact with one of my old friends once more and he too was coincidentally studying for the same exams so i told my mother about this and she and his mom got in touch this guy had been preparing for these exams for quite some time while i only got serious about it recently and my mother loved to compare us both every fucking waking moment she used to taunt me so much that it lead to so many arguments those arguments were so heated my throat used to hurt the next day from all that shouting she taunted me and humiliated me by saying that shit in front of my physics teacher my maths teacher but she was smart enough not to talk about him in front of my father i used to scream tell her to leave me alone try to make her understand but it didnt work and that guy is a complete douchebag in real life i told my mother about this she wanted me to hangout with him despite me telling her so many times how arrogant and annoying he is but she didnt listen and i lashed out extremely bad that was on friday our fight was so bad and so much shouting was involved my throat hurt and her stomach started aching the next day which she later blamed me for then today on monday i wanted to talk to her about the college i had gotten and she just dismissed it another thing about her is that she is very disrespectful and will never acknowledge it she talks to me like trash calls me like some servant from across the house when she has work that needs to be done she will curse at me when she gets angry but when i reach my breaking point i am a bad son who doesnt know how to talk to his mother she never accepts her faults so today we got into the same argument after she again was acting dismissive of my college course for which i will be going out of my city in a month for five years she just seems so indifferent not even a single compliment or anything just picking at my previous mistakes and taunting me that ill do the same when i go to college it was all too much for me today so when she was in my room again today pestering me i told her to leave multiple times i was on the verge of crying and threw a pillow at her to get the point across she just brushed it off and continued it all became too much to bear and i pushed her and she fell down on the floor i regretted it so damn much and she was looking at me like im some monster so she started crying and telling me what kind of son ami i to do this and she said to me she wants nothing to do with me and that she should have never given birth to me she said she didnt want to hear my disgusting voice when i try to justify myself keep in mind that this is after i got accepted in a good college with a good course in ai she has never been appreciative of a single thing and frankly i feel like a monster i want to commit suicide i feel like dying and i feel like trash i am afraid ill do this and lash out in the same way when i get a girlfriend or a wife and be tagged as an abuser i have a past of being bullied and i really cant handle being put down like someone pathetic i feel so bad just thinking about i never once have put my hands on her and this was the first time i did it in anger i am not proud of it	dkcv
77	I purposefully act stupid and put myself in situations where others will get mad at me.	"I grew up in a very emotional distant household, meaning any emotion that was not overtly happy was bad. you would be either ignored, told to push it down or sometimes be flatly yelled at, threatened, or hit. This caused me to never know how to properly and healthy feel emotions or gauge when something was 'worth it'. I would take small things, like being respectfully criticized, and take them as a personal attack, blowing them out of proportion. 

Around the age of 14 I realized that this was not an attitude that would help me in the long run, especially considering my goals. The only solution I could think of was to put myself in situations I knew that I would take personally, and then force myself to work through it and learn how to let it bounce off of me. I don't like being perceived as stupid to people in real life so I would exclusively act like a troll online (was never rude but certainly acted/speak in ignorant ways or in places It wasn't my place to). 

I still do this as I still have trouble with this but I definitely have made far strides since childhood and am a lot calmer when in 'uncomfortable' situations. I do also act like a troll on this account so feel free to talk shit to me lmao."	1djrwsh	i purposefully act stupid and put myself in situations where others will get mad at me	"i grew up in a very emotional distant household meaning any emotion that was not overtly happy was bad you would be either ignored told to push it down or sometimes be flatly yelled at threatened or hit this caused me to never know how to properly and healthy feel emotions or gauge when something was worth it i would take small things like being respectfully criticized and take them as a personal attack blowing them out of proportion

78	I used a kid in middle school for chocolate and snacks.	"Okay so this happened back when I was in 7th grade. 

Back in 7th grade my family was hella poor so we really never could afford luxuries such as candy and toys. I only ever got the essentials growing up. I had a best friend at the time who was the best linemen on the team (you all know what I mean by that). Every day he would come to school he had hella candy and snacks that he would eat throughout the day, but he wouldn't share unless you were dating him. So about 3 weeks goes by and he gets a girlfriend and buys her a fuck ton of candy and snacks. About a week later they broke up and I had the bright idea to fake liking him so that I could get snacks because I knew he liked me. So he asked to be my boyfriend. I said yes and the next day at school I had hella snacks waiting for me. I broke up with him after I took the snacks.

My step dad thought it was for me, as Nicole is my middle name. Even though no one had ever called me “Nicki” in my life. Anyway, it sounded like a high schooler and i thought this was really cool. I also just liked the fact that my stepdad thought I had a friend and a cool nickname. I talked as if I knew who was on the other end and she went along with it. She told me her drama and I gave the advice of an 8 year old.

84	Complete memory loss on my last night in Santiago and it terrifies me	"After two months of studying in Santiago, it was my last night before leaving. After a farewell dinner with all my Chilean friends, one of my American guy friends convinced me to go to the club with him one last time. 

I had been drinking at the dinner, but little. My guy friend was chasing after a girl he'd been texting for a while so I found a guy to talk to. He was older, but I was used to this in Chile since it's very common for clubs to be filled with older men. He looked Russian, which was incredibly strange in Chile. This didn't mean anything but it stood out to me as unusual.

We talked at the bar for a while, and the man bought me a drink. I was distracted, but I know he was holding my drink for a long time before giving it to me. I took two sips of my drink and that's all that I remember until the next morning. 

I woke up with white powder coated on the outside of my lips. Disoriented, I didn't even think about it at the time. I called my guy friend, and he told me he found me drunk and incoherent, alone, and helped me home. I am so grateful to him. He told me he had no idea where I went, but that I probably just drank too much and I shouldnt worry. 

The day after was blurry to me, much more than a normal hangover. Or maybe it wasn't and I am convincing myself it was. I have bruises on my knees and shins. These don't concern me too much because my guy friend said it was very likely I would have fallen in my state. What scares me is bruises on  my arms. There aren't many but a few on my left arm that terrify me in their resemblance to finger marks. 

I told some of this to my guy friend and he told me not to assume the worst. He reminded me alcohol can sometimes take a long time to fully take effect, then feel like it hits you all at once. 

I don't know if I'm frustrated with my friend for assuming something worse didn't happen, or if he's right in assuming that. I don't want to be the kind of girl who jumps to a conclusion accusing a man of something to avoid responsibility. If I got too wasted and made a fool of myself that's my own fault and I'm to blame. But part of me feels like that doesn't add up, and I'm terrified. Mainly I dont understand the powder on my lips that morning. 

I don't know what to think and I am just scared. "	1dhoylp	complete memory loss on my last night in santiago and it terrifies me	"after two months of studying in santiago it was my last night before leaving after a farewell dinner with all my chilean friends one of my american guy friends convinced me to go to the club with him one last time 

i had been drinking at the dinner but little my guy friend was chasing after a girl hed been texting for a while so i found a guy to talk to he was older but i was used to this in chile since its very common for clubs to be filled with older men he looked russian which was incredibly strange in chile this didnt mean anything but it stood out to me as unusual

we talked at the bar for a while and the man bought me a drink i was distracted but i know he was holding my drink for a long time before giving it to me i took two sips of my drink and thats all that i remember until the next morning 

i woke up with white powder coated on the outside of my lips disoriented i didnt even think about it at the time i called my guy friend and he told me he found me drunk and incoherent alone and helped me home i am so grateful to him he told me he had no idea where i went but that i probably just drank too much and i shouldnt worry 

the day after was blurry to me much more than a normal hangover or maybe it wasnt and i am convincing myself it was i have bruises on my knees and shins these dont concern me too much because my guy friend said it was very likely i would have fallen in my state what scares me is bruises on  my arms there arent many but a few on my left arm that terrify me in their resemblance to finger marks 

i told some of this to my guy friend and he told me not to assume the worst he reminded me alcohol can sometimes take a long time to fully take effect then feel like it hits you all at once 

i dont know if im frustrated with my friend for assuming something worse didnt happen or if hes right in assuming that i dont want to be the kind of girl who jumps to a conclusion accusing a man of something to avoid responsibility if i got too wasted and made a fool of myself thats my own fault and im to blame but part of me feels like that doesnt add up and im terrified mainly i dont understand the powder on my lips that morning

85	I did awful things to be a part of a friendship group	"I’m not sure if this belongs here, but I do blame myself for what happened.

When I was little, around 7 I think, there was this group of girls who I wanted to talk to. I thought they were the coolest people ever and I wanted so badly for them to like me. One day, I went up to them and asked to be their friend. Being 7, this had worked for me up until this point so I was shocked when they said no. I didn’t know what to do and I was so embarrassed but the next day I decided I would try again. I had a lot of determination then and I went back to them every single day for about 2 weeks (maybe). Eventually, they agreed to let me join their group IF I passed a series of challenges. They were all I had wanted to be a part of and so I gladly agreed. The first “challenge” was that I had to eat a mud sandwich. One of the girls had brought 2 pieces of bread specifically for me. I thought it was really disgusting but they were already acting like we were friends so I couldn’t say no. I ate the entire sandwich. It was grainy and soggy and I still remember what it tastes like to this day. My Second task was to go into the school bathroom with a boy in our class. I really don’t remember much about it except we were both naked at some point. It really scares me that I have no idea what happened in that bathroom. After I had done the last 2 challenges, the girls brought out a bunch of worms. They told me to lay down and close my eyes. They pulled down my tights and put the worms in my underwear. I had to keep them in my pants for 2 minutes and then I would finally be allowed to be their friends. 
I wish I could say that when I got older, I stopped being their friend. But that didn’t happen. I stayed in their friendship group until I was 13. And the only reason i stopped talking to them is because I moved and they started to ignore my texts."	1dhd1ew	i did awful things to be a part of a friendship group	"im not sure if this belongs here but i do blame myself for what happened

86	I didn’t pay the full balance for my Burger King order	I went through the Burger King drive thru today and the total for my order came to around $23.45. I decided to pay $22 in cash. I knew this wasn’t enough, but I just gave the cashier the money and was gonna wait for her to tell me it wasn’t enough so that I could have given her my card to cover the remaining balance. About 15-30 seconds later, the cashier stepped away and another employee came through the window and gave me my food. I was a little surprised that he did this because I knew I didn’t pay the full balance. I drove off anyway. I know the employees fucked up and didn’t communicate the fact that I didn’t fully pay for my food, but I really should have given her my cash and card at the same time or should have brought it up instead of driving away.	1dgmn5m	i didnt pay the full balance for my burger king order	i went through the burger king drive thru today and the total for my order came to around  i decided to pay  in cash i knew this wasnt enough but i just gave the cashier the money and was gonna wait for her to tell me it wasnt enough so that i could have given her my card to cover the remaining balance about  seconds later the cashier stepped away and another employee came through the window and gave me my food i was a little surprised that he did this because i knew i didnt pay the full balance i drove off anyway i know the employees fucked up and didnt communicate the fact that i didnt fully pay for my food but i really should have given her my cash and card at the same time or should have brought it up instead of driving away	dgmnm
87	I used to pick my friends mostly based on looks. Too ugly, next. Too pretty, next. Somewhere in the middle, yeah that’s good.	Okay, so a little bit of background just for context is, I was raised by narcissists and specifically a narc mother who was always commenting on other girls bodies and looks in super critical ways. I knew deep down that everyone was equal and looks shouldn’t matter, but I think subconsciously I did this because I heard my parent speak on looks so much I just went with it without question. Unfortunately it wasn’t until my 30s that I really set aside all care of others looks, mostly because I did the work to heal the insecure parts of me that even cared. I’m sure it’s no surprise that I fell into the mean girls group at one point and only years later did I except that I was one for a while. Being raised by toxic people can corrupt even the best intentioned people.	1dg9brp	i used to pick my friends mostly based on looks too ugly next too pretty next somewhere in the middle yeah thats good	okay so a little bit of background just for context is i was raised by narcissists and specifically a narc mother who was always commenting on other girls bodies and looks in super critical ways i knew deep down that everyone was equal and looks shouldnt matter but i think subconsciously i did this because i heard my parent speak on looks so much i just went with it without question unfortunately it wasnt until my s that i really set aside all care of others looks mostly because i did the work to heal the insecure parts of me that even cared im sure its no surprise that i fell into the mean girls group at one point and only years later did i except that i was one for a while being raised by toxic people can corrupt even the best intentioned people	dgbrp
88	Put my hand in a girl’s shirt in elementary school	I just remembered this memory and it kind of hit my like a bag of bricks. When I was in 5th grade I was hanging out with friends after school and one of the girls stole my phone and put it in her bra (she was like 11 or 12 but was held back) and I remember wanting my phone back so I just reached into her shirt and took my phone back. I don’t think my intentions were anything other than to get my phone back but I realize that putting my hands in someone else’s shirt was wrong. 	1dfmmc6	put my hand in a girls shirt in elementary school	i just remembered this memory and it kind of hit my like a bag of bricks when i was in th grade i was hanging out with friends after school and one of the girls stole my phone and put it in her bra she was like  or  but was held back and i remember wanting my phone back so i just reached into her shirt and took my phone back i dont think my intentions were anything other than to get my phone back but i realize that putting my hands in someone elses shirt was wrong 	dfmmc
89	I Gave a 7th Grader a Miscarriage by kicking her in the stomach.	"This happened in 8th grade and the girl was in 7th.  I just turned 14 and she was 13. Ngl she was fine, and me and my homie would walk home with her and her little brothers after school. One day her and I were play fighting and she got a bit unfair, she said that I couldn’t throw punches or kicks but she could do it because she’s a girl and she was scared. She punches hard as shit tho, and she was really close just throwing haymakers. Not wanting to punch back, I kneed her in the stomach. Not THAT hard but hard enough for her to back up a bit. She said something like “stop boy you gon kill my baby!” Now reasonably, I thought she was joking. Because what 7th grader was catching dick? Anyway the next day I got around to doing it again and she said the same thing, and I began to take her a bit seriously but I didn’t want to because yk…. 7 grader-Pregnant?? No way bro😭😭. Then a couple days she tells me that she had a miscarriage. I was in shock. I asked 3 if her friends and they all confirmed that she was pregnant beforehand. I was utterly mortified. I still don’t know if I wanna trust that however. But I just may have blood on my hands.


Update-When I say “got to doing it again” I didn’t mean I just went up to her and kicked her, I mean we got to play fighting again, she gave the same silly rules, and I kneed her again😢.

90	When I Was 5, I Pulled The Fire Alarm And Pretended I Didn’t Know Any Better	"When I was 5 years old, we were coming back from lunch and the teacher had told us before lunch we weren’t having recess that day.

So, that made me mad because I wanted to go outside.  So, I saw the opportunity to go outside, a little red box that said ‘Fire - Pull Down’.  I pulled it!  My classmates looked at me in disbelief.  Then the I heard the loud shrill of the fire alarm and we went outside.

My Kindergarten teacher comes up and stoically tells me I’m going to principal.

Anyways, I go to the principal and he’s grilling me.  I’m getting scared I’m going to be expelled.  So, I play stupid.  I say ‘Well, the box said to Pull Down.  I was just obeying what the sign says.  Like whenever my mom sees a ‘Stop’ sign she stops her car.  I was just trying to be a good citizen and obey the signs.’  Principal goes silent for a second and then lectures me on how dangerous it is to falsely activate the alarm.  Then he tells me he’s calling my parents.  But that was it.

My mom only said one thing to me about it, ‘Why would you do something like that.  You’re better than that.’  The way she said it made me feel bad.

After that, some kids thought it was really cool and would high-five me in the hall.

Looking back on it, I also realize now, there was another reason, I wanted to show my classmates how cool and brave I was.

93	I used to make up crazy stories to see how gullible people are 	When I was a teenager I used to be front end manager at a grocery store until my early 20’s. The job sucked so I did what I could to amuse myself. We cycled through employees pretty quickly so sometimes I would make up crazy stories to tell to new hires that I didn’t think would last too long. One night I had a younger kid on shift, he was like 15 at the time and clearly not the brightest. For some reason I had a Velcro strap on my wrist that I needed for something and just put it on as a bracelet so I didn’t lose it before I needed it. The kid asked me why I had the Velcro on my wrist so I convinced him that I had some rare disease where I didn’t show up in photographs because my body didn’t generate enough static electricity and I had to wear the Velcro to generate enough static to do so. In all honesty I never thought it was believable but he was fascinated. He asked “so if I take a picture of you right now, you won’t show up??” I said no I’m good now, I have my Velcro on. But I came up with a whole back story about how it was months before anyone noticed because in the age of disposable cameras, my parents picked up on it after getting a bunch of rolls of film developed from when I was an infant to realize I didn’t appear in any of the photos and my family members appeared as if they were holding nothing 😂	1dea5ho	i used to make up crazy stories to see how gullible people are 	when i was a teenager i used to be front end manager at a grocery store until my early s the job sucked so i did what i could to amuse myself we cycled through employees pretty quickly so sometimes i would make up crazy stories to tell to new hires that i didnt think would last too long one night i had a younger kid on shift he was like  at the time and clearly not the brightest for some reason i had a velcro strap on my wrist that i needed for something and just put it on as a bracelet so i didnt lose it before i needed it the kid asked me why i had the velcro on my wrist so i convinced him that i had some rare disease where i didnt show up in photographs because my body didnt generate enough static electricity and i had to wear the velcro to generate enough static to do so in all honesty i never thought it was believable but he was fascinated he asked so if i take a picture of you right now you wont show up i said no im good now i have my velcro on but i came up with a whole back story about how it was months before anyone noticed because in the age of disposable cameras my parents picked up on it after getting a bunch of rolls of film developed from when i was an infant to realize i didnt appear in any of the photos and my family members appeared as if they were holding nothing 	deaho

95	When I was a kid, I would steal my classmate’s cookie every day from their lunchbox	"I’ve never told anyone this and my classmate still doesn’t know. 

When I was a kid, I saw one of my friends eating a massive white chocolate, macadamia nut cookie for lunchtime. I wasn’t given a packed lunch, I had free school meals and a free fruit, so I would get pretty hungry during the day.

Anyway, when everyone had taken their 1st break, I stayed behind in the bathroom, I went to her packed lunch box and stole her cookie. 

It was beautiful; it was slow-baked and fresh and had the sweetest taste and tore apart like a crumble in my mouth. To this day it is the best cookie I ever had. 

Anyway, after I had finished, I threw the rubbish away and returned her lunchbox. Coming up to lunchtime I kept a keen eye on her, anxious to know if I would be caught and frightened that the jig was up. To my glee, she hadn’t noticed that she was missing her cookie. She had probably thought that her mum didn’t pack it for her. 

The next day the same thing happened. I waited for everyone to leave on the first break, hid in the bathroom, devoured the cookie, discarded the rubbish and returned the lunchbox. 

This time, during lunch, I could see that she was confused as to why the cookie wasn’t in her lunch box. The rising adrenaline took over; my heart began to race and my hands became clammy. I watched from a distance, convinced she would come over and confront me. She didn’t. 

After lunch, the case of the missing cookie spread; it was the talk of the class. Someone was stealing her cookie and others were deliberating if they had been struck by the cookie culprit or if would they be next. Accusations were flying - someone saw another classmate with a similar cookie for lunch, and another person had seen someone in the corridor earlier. I was off the hook, again. But now, it was serious. 

The next day came around and all I could think of was the cookie. I overheard her talking to her friends; she confirmed that her mum had packed it and she would be eating it at lunch. 1st break came around and I was ready.

I snuck into the lunchbox area like before and scoffed the whole thing down, anxious that I would be caught. I scurried out to the playground and went about my day undetected. 

After lunch, the teacher announced that her mum had called in. Someone had been stealing from her daughter's lunchbox and she wanted to know who. We were all warned that it was being taken seriously and of the ramifications of our actions. 

I knew I couldn’t steal the cookie again, but I also needed a fall guy. The previous year, a boy in my class had punched me and I never got my revenge. It was coming together like a jigsaw puzzle, he would be perfect and it would be believable. 

I confessed to the teacher that I had seen him looking suspicious in the corridors and the bait was taken. He had taken the blame and I got off scot-free.

I do feel guilty about this to this day, especially for blaming it on someone else. When I look back I can't believe that I would ever do that, but I did. To my classmates, I'm sorry I stole your cookie and I'm sorry for blaming you for my actions.

98	Time to admit it. I'm a user, I use people. I've known this for a while but am apparently unwilling to change.	"I currently have no money. I'm super irresponsible with my money, and have a limited amount a month. I spend my money on myself (marijuana and cigarettes unfortunately), smoke a few friends out a few times, and then start hanging out with specific people I know will feed my addiction. 

Storytime: I'm 37, but I was in a car crash when I was 23. I had a piece of my brain removed due to swelling, I spent a month and a half in a coma, in addition to a host of medical problems. While I am able to work; I am lucid, cognitive, and able-bodied (although kinda overweight now due to laziness). My old friends, although they stood by for a while, but now they're either parents, spouses, addicts, dead, or lost in politics. The two friends I currently spend my time with are both disabled in the same manner as me (TBI), but they are both objectively less cognitive than me. I don't particularly like spending time with them, but I do, because I get things, whether it be smokes or just something to do.

When I had a job somewhat recently, I hung out with them a lot less. I still saw them to keep up appearances, I guess. I mean, they're cool, I'd see them sometimes, but that's because I'd feel bad. Probably because I want everyone to like me. But I've always been this way to an extent, especially after the disability. I don't know.

I never did anything too evil or immoral, but I have an ability to usually make people like me. I don't lie, but I exaggerate. I feel bad using that ability, very immoral. That's kinda manipulation, right? So I guess I'm sometimes a manipulator. But I don't change!

There are so many changes that have to happen, I still have so much potential. Instead of using this potential, I am just waiting for something to fall into my lap and subconsciously making my friends sometimes give me stuff. Small things though, like convincing my friend to buy weed and smoke me up when he didn't want to, and him ending up thanking me. Meanwhile, I feel horrible I did that. The internal voice is like, maniacal/sad. I feel very immoral for this. I have so much changes to make, including this. I don't understand why I'm not changing. Maybe it's just easier to make this topic and absolve myself instead of actually changing. There we go, I psychoanalyzed this post so you don't have to :)

I want to delete this now, but I already wrote it, so...

Edit: now I didn't think this is true, because those two friends are admittedly very lonely, I give them something to do. Also, I invite one of the dudes to parties when I go. I still think I have these negative traits, but I try to give back when I take."	1dcsq6b	time to admit it im a user i use people ive known this for a while but am apparently unwilling to change	"i currently have no money im super irresponsible with my money and have a limited amount a month i spend my money on myself marijuana and cigarettes unfortunately smoke a few friends out a few times and then start hanging out with specific people i know will feed my addiction 

storytime im  but i was in a car crash when i was  i had a piece of my brain removed due to swelling i spent a month and a half in a coma in addition to a host of medical problems while i am able to work i am lucid cognitive and ablebodied although kinda overweight now due to laziness my old friends although they stood by for a while but now theyre either parents spouses addicts dead or lost in politics the two friends i currently spend my time with are both disabled in the same manner as me tbi but they are both objectively less cognitive than me i dont particularly like spending time with them but i do because i get things whether it be smokes or just something to do

when i had a job somewhat recently i hung out with them a lot less i still saw them to keep up appearances i guess i mean theyre cool id see them sometimes but thats because id feel bad probably because i want everyone to like me but ive always been this way to an extent especially after the disability i dont know

i never did anything too evil or immoral but i have an ability to usually make people like me i dont lie but i exaggerate i feel bad using that ability very immoral thats kinda manipulation right so i guess im sometimes a manipulator but i dont change

there are so many changes that have to happen i still have so much potential instead of using this potential i am just waiting for something to fall into my lap and subconsciously making my friends sometimes give me stuff small things though like convincing my friend to buy weed and smoke me up when he didnt want to and him ending up thanking me meanwhile i feel horrible i did that the internal voice is like maniacalsad i feel very immoral for this i have so much changes to make including this i dont understand why im not changing maybe its just easier to make this topic and absolve myself instead of actually changing there we go i psychoanalyzed this post so you dont have to 

i want to delete this now but i already wrote it so

edit now i didnt think this is true because those two friends are admittedly very lonely i give them something to do also i invite one of the dudes to parties when i go i still think i have these negative traits but i try to give back when i take"	dcsqb
99	I stole from my work as a teenager when I didnt get a raise.	" 

When I was a teenager, I worked for a local chain of gift stores that specialized in greeting cards. We had 8 stores in the region and not once did any of us ever work in any other location than our store.

I worked there for 2 1/2 years. I was never late, never called in sick, picked up extra shifts whenever they asked me to, worked late for special events and vounteered holidays. I was even put in charge of my own department (Ordering and floor setting Mikasa cyrstal)  But I was always paired with a miserable supervisor. She was an older woman who used to make us massage her back, tie her shoes, kept drinks at the cash wrap even though it was allowed and loved to leave us with one cashier (Usually ME) at our busiest time.  She also had this lovely habit of coming into the break room to see what we were eating for lunch and say ""You can eat that in 10 minutes. You need to be on the floor. We're busy.""  (We WERE an extremely busy store. It was the 90's.)  Everyone complained about her but nothing ever got done. I absolutely adored the job but working with ""Beth"" was pure torture.

At the 2 year mark, when raises were being handed out and I was given a .10 per hour ""raise"".  The reason ""Well, Beth said you arent a team player.""   I was furious. Money was tight at home so I worked to buy my own school lunhes, clothes and car insurance, gas, school supplies etc.. My senior prom was coming up and I needed a dress.

This store sold a lot of ""collectibles.""  Think of the overpriced bric a brac they used to sell in the 90's that all of our moms hoarded thinking they we would be valuable someday. Figurines, little light up houses, Plates etc.

One day a customer bought a new figurine that had recenty come out. It was from a collection of figurines featuring doe eyed children, to give you an idea. It was huge and very expensive for the line. Around $300.  She paid with cash. I went to the back to get one of the boxed ones.  Noticed there were a half dozen more of the same figurine. After  I rang her out, I reprinted her receipt.  This was before transaction capturing. Our reprint didnt say they were reprints. I then went to the back, took one of the figurines and stashed it in the trash. ""Beth"" would NEVER take the trash to the dumpster. I always had to do it.  So I did and stashed the box behind the compactor and retrieved it after my shift.  Two days later, I went to another one of our stores in the next town over and ""returned"" it for cash.

I did this every few weeks for the last 6 months I was there. Only ever cash transactions and only when were busy so 1, no one would notice me reprinting receipts and 2, I was always going into the stock room.  I only did it with boxed collectibles that we kept in the back.

Never got caught. We had enough stores in the area that I could go to a different one each time so no one was wondering why one store was getting so many returns from our store. I quit that fall to leave for college.

Looking back, I know it was stupid. Not just immoral but they definitely would have pressed charges had I been caught. And, I really did like the job.  While classmates my age were standing over deep fryers, I was dusting crystal and straightening cards, and came home smelling like scented candles rather than lard, so I felt rotten about it later.  But, my parents were REALLY struggling and I was a teenager on my own to pay for even basic essentials and getting ready to leave for college. ..  The chain folded a few years later due to interperosnal problems between the owners. I dont think they even noticed the missing merchandise."	1dcrges	i stole from my work as a teenager when i didnt get a raise	"

100	I told people that I had cancer in the 6th grade. 	"I got bullied really bad in 6th grade because I was very vocal about my love for anime, and everyone thought it was weird (this was in 2014), so when I found out I was moving schools, I told my best friend to help me out with telling people I had cancer to make people feel bad for bullying me. She was practically my only friend, so no one would know if I was lying or not because no one really knew me like that. We started telling people, and when I moved schools I had her tell them that I died from the cancer.

She told me this one girl started crying when she told her I died. I don't know if she ever told the truth to them. She hates me now, so I'll never know. 

Yes, I'm prepared for the future cancer that karma will bring on me for this. Just wanted to put it here. I feel pretty messed up when I think about it.

Probably should've made a throw away account for this, now people are gonna think I'm really messed up in the head 😂"	1dc8s1y	i told people that i had cancer in the th grade 	"i got bullied really bad in th grade because i was very vocal about my love for anime and everyone thought it was weird this was in  so when i found out i was moving schools i told my best friend to help me out with telling people i had cancer to make people feel bad for bullying me she was practically my only friend so no one would know if i was lying or not because no one really knew me like that we started telling people and when i moved schools i had her tell them that i died from the cancer

101	Remembered I bullied a kid in the 2nd grade 11 years ago and can't stop thinking about it.	It was a free lecture (the teacher was absent) the substitute teacher had some work and assigned me as the disciplinary monitor of the class for the lecture and left the class. Akid sitting next to me was playing with some trading cards and this kid was literally the class clown, the troublemaker, always got punished by teachers and I thought he isn't a good kid so I went close to him snached the card and tore it. I don't know why I remembered this but now I am getting all sad and emotional and remembering how I unknowingly made another kid cry and all the bad deeds I ever did. I am just hating the kid me who should have known better. It's not that big of a deal but when I reached my teenage alot changed with me. Whenever I saw some emotional stuff even if it was as small as a kid crying after a fall...I would immediately imagine myself at their place and feel sad about it...it had stopped a few years ago but today that sadness came back.the feeling of a sad child who did nothing wrong. I fricking hate myself	1dbze5e	remembered i bullied a kid in the nd grade  years ago and cant stop thinking about it	it was a free lecture the teacher was absent the substitute teacher had some work and assigned me as the disciplinary monitor of the class for the lecture and left the class akid sitting next to me was playing with some trading cards and this kid was literally the class clown the troublemaker always got punished by teachers and i thought he isnt a good kid so i went close to him snached the card and tore it i dont know why i remembered this but now i am getting all sad and emotional and remembering how i unknowingly made another kid cry and all the bad deeds i ever did i am just hating the kid me who should have known better its not that big of a deal but when i reached my teenage alot changed with me whenever i saw some emotional stuff even if it was as small as a kid crying after a falli would immediately imagine myself at their place and feel sad about itit had stopped a few years ago but today that sadness came backthe feeling of a sad child who did nothing wrong i fricking hate myself	dbzee
102	I dropped someone’s classes and got their job offer taken away	"Made another account for obvious reasons.

Last year me and this guy, let's say Mark we're kinda close and we were graduating from college. We both were computer science majors and were ready to graduate and start our lives. As you may know, the job market is in shambles right now and even getting a internship is pain.

I applied for a job listing and it had a offer where you would get some bonus if you referred a friend. I of course referred Mark and he somehow got a interview and job offer while I didn't even get a letter back.

No offense but I was better then Mark in most aspects, better gpa, more experience. 

The reason I think he got the job was because he had a internship at Google and his dad was kind of a big name in some company.

That part really didn't bother me as much, but it's WHEN he boasted about it. I don't blame him for it as it's exciting to get a new job, however I felt like he was bragging a little to much. This also didn't help that he talked about moving in with his gf and starting a new life while my ex broke up with me for some reason I'd rather not say.

I had enough of this and did something I really regret. I was over at his apartment and was in his room and noticed he was logged into his school account, I think he was sending his transcripts to the job or something I think. He left the room to answer a call and I realized I had a opportunity.

I truly regret it at the time, but I didn't care and jealousy was running threw me, I logged in and dropped his classes.

This was midway threw the semester so they appeared as withdraws.

I was only able to do this for 3 of his classes and the other 2 needed registrar approval.

I quickly tabbed back to what his screen was before and pretended nothing happened.

I got a call later from him a month later that the job offer was taken away as he could not graduate that semester, even when pleading with the office of registration.

You might wonder ""how did he not know it was you"". Me and him were really good so he never accused me of it and he though someone hacked him.

He later did get a job offer but it was way less then what he had, I actually earn more then him as he is still working there.

I feel terrible, but what's done is done and I just wanted to vent about it.

I'm really sorry Mark"	1dbkrhq	i dropped someones classes and got their job offer taken away	"made another account for obvious reasons

103	I harassed two people while I was mentally ill when I was 13. 	"These two people were always very nice to me. We had a lot of moments when we got along. But a lot of the time was me making them feel guilty about all my problems I had and I just blamed them for everything that was falling apart in my life. I harassed them almost every day for probably 3 months. I texted them horrible things and played the victim constantly  . They say they forgive me but I just can’t live with myself anymore because nothing is fun anymore. Knowing what I did I can’t be happy and I don’t deserve it. I’ve made several life ruining mistakes at 13, 14, and 15. I’m 16 now, and haven’t screwed up YET.  and alls I want to do is help other people now and that is something I swore to do for the rest of however longer I’m going to live. 

Alls I feel is remorse for the everything I’ve done in my life and it’s miserable. Should I be forgiven and do I deserve a life

104	I broke my streak after over four months of being clean. TW:SH	"So as the title explains, I had a relapse after 122 days of not harming myself. It was a culmination of stress from exam periods and a specific assignment due tomorrow (that I'm probably not going to be able to finish). I know that I should probably talk to someone (other than strangers on this app) about my issues and the fact that I just relapsed, but I can't think of a single person that I want to tell. Telling my therapist wouldn't be smart as I would like to prevent my parents finding out about this, and due to the policies she has she would be forced to because I am a minor. I don't want to unload this on any of my friends, as they are either not as close to me, or on the other side of the world. Part of the reason I might have relapsed is because my previous scars had almost completely faded, and there was an enormous sense of guilt that came with that, which makes me worry that this cycle will only continue after these fresh ones start fading. I'm headed out with friends in about an hour or so, and am supposed to be doing work on the project I mentioned earlier, but right now all I can focus on is how distanced I feel from myself. Sorry for unloading this here, but I feel like this is more okay as thrill be easy to ignore. To anyone who did read this, have a great day :)

105	I was in a nightclub cinema once and decided the best way to get down to the exit was on the backs of the chairs 	I thought it was a really good  idea to use the backs of the chairs to walk down to the front. Having made it down the 10 rows I nearly made it apart from the last row. Unfortunately a girl was sitting in the next seat to my triumph and I landed really heavily on her leg. Embarrassed and apologetic she screamed in pain. I begged forgiveness bought her and friends a round of drinks but the damage was done.

106	When I was 9, I stole my mother's diamond earrings, which were precious family heirloom, to give them to my sweetheart at the time.	"My mother comes from an old-money family and inherited precious family jewelry, although she almost never wears it. One day in primary school, I decided to give a birthday gift to my sweetheart at the time, Lucile. I went to my mother's bedroom, picked out a pair of beautiful gold and diamond earrings, and put them in a small camera film box. The next day at school, I gave them to Lucile.

Since my mother almost never wears jewelry, it took her several months to notice. But when she did, she was very upset. Not only did the earrings have sentimental value, but apparently I had stolen the most expensive pair of all. She searched everywhere for months and asked my brother and me many times if we had seen them.

Eventually, my grandfather was informed, and he was furious too because those earrings had been passed down for many generations. 

It's been over 20 years now, and I have never said anything. Sometimes the topic still comes up at family gatherings..."	1dajsa0	when i was  i stole my mothers diamond earrings which were precious family heirloom to give them to my sweetheart at the time	"my mother comes from an oldmoney family and inherited precious family jewelry although she almost never wears it one day in primary school i decided to give a birthday gift to my sweetheart at the time lucile i went to my mothers bedroom picked out a pair of beautiful gold and diamond earrings and put them in a small camera film box the next day at school i gave them to lucile

107	I lied about hurting my ankle, but it turned out to be actually broken.	"23M. 
So when i was in 3rd or 4th grade (i don’t remember) I really didn’t want to go to one of my baseball games the next day. It was out of town and I wanted to hangout with my friends that day. I decided that I was going to fake sprain my ankle, because that’s the most plausible way (don’t know how I thought i’d be able to see my friends with an injury, but whatever). Anyways, my mom was in the living room and I fake tripped over the table. Made the waterworks come and everything. Looking back I don’t think I was too believable, but my mom decided to take me to the ER anyways.
I was crying the whole way there and when we got there they rushed me in. They took X-rays and gave me an IV. All the fun stuff. 
Here comes the wildest part, it was actually broken. My growth plate was fractured and they immediately put me in a cast. I’ve always had a high pain tolerance, but that was actually freaky. It didn’t hurt at all.
They showed us the X-ray and everything. Said I might need surgery and they needed to monitor the fracture. 
They had to X-ray me frequently after that to make sure my foot would still grown normally as well or something like that.
I did successfully get out of that game though. I was not to happy about being in a cast and a boot for a few weeks, however.
Anyways Ive literally never told anyone this, so yeah. Thanks for reading.

For some context this app is for hook ups but a lot of people do sell on there. Anyways some guy added me and was like “I’ll give you the stuff for free if you give me 🧠”. And I was desperate so I went along with it. I was going to do it in his car but he ended up not showing up for the first meet up. So he texts me sorry but was like “I’ll give you $200 if you swallow a bit of my pee”. For the recorded I was extremely discussed but I was kind of poor and really desperate so I went along with it again BAD IDEA GUYS. Not to go into details but we meet up and it was TERRIBLE. The guy was extremely shady and I swear almost kidnapped me. I did end up getting the stuff but guys not a good experience. Moral of the story don’t meet up with strangers on the internet.

109	I've been lying about my age for nearly seven years.	"Basically just what the title says. I joined social media in the 6th grade and quickly made tons of friends online but they were all 13-14 when I was just an 11 year old kid so I lied about being three years older than I actually am. I'm close to turning 18 soon and the guilt has been eating me alive but I'm just so heartbroken by the idea I'll lose friendships I've built over these past years. I'm sure most people probably wouldn't care enough to end the friendship with me because quite a few of them are around my age anyways (17-21) but I'm sure it would cause my reputation to be tarnished and the few adults who are already much older than me to be disgusted about being friends with such a youngin. For example, I have a friend who's so supportive and has been so nice to me who's 24 and I feel they might be disgusted with knowing I'm actually 6 years younger than they are. I also just know so many people who have built a supportive community around me and even though my current real relationships aren't bad at all, I've essentially grown up with these people and gotten attached to them. Lately I just feel so guilty and so trapped; so many great things have been happening lately and I wanna talk about them but I obviously can't.

I recently (yesterday) came clean to two of my friends that I've known for the past 6 years and they took it really well but they're also around my age and have never been serious people, so I assume their reactions would be drastically different than some of my other friends' will be if I decide to come clean about it. They don't really have an opinion on the whole thing because they're okay with still being friends, and have actually joked with me and laughed with me about the whole thing, and aren't pressuring me to tell the truth but one of them is just concerned I'll become very overwhelmed and it'll just spill out anyways in the future if I don't just come clean now like I did with them. I'm also scared because I had a relationship with someone at the age of 12 when she was 15 (I'm ashamed to admit I didn't see anything wrong with this at the time and we also frequently talked explicitly) and we're great friends now and have been only friends for the past five years now but I know she'd probably feel disgusted if she found out.

i recently yesterday came clean to two of my friends that ive known for the past  years and they took it really well but theyre also around my age and have never been serious people so i assume their reactions would be drastically different than some of my other friends will be if i decide to come clean about it they dont really have an opinion on the whole thing because theyre okay with still being friends and have actually joked with me and laughed with me about the whole thing and arent pressuring me to tell the truth but one of them is just concerned ill become very overwhelmed and itll just spill out anyways in the future if i dont just come clean now like i did with them im also scared because i had a relationship with someone at the age of  when she was  im ashamed to admit i didnt see anything wrong with this at the time and we also frequently talked explicitly and were great friends now and have been only friends for the past five years now but i know shed probably feel disgusted if she found out i dont wanna lose her because of the history between us but i also understand im way in over my head for the reality of my age im just so frustrated and disgusted with myself too for letting it go on this long im definitely not saying im mature because if i was this would have never happened but i am extremely academically intelligent and i assume most of these people dont suspect me because of how i carry myself should i just keep going until i can decide i can move on eg delete all my accounts suddenly or make the move to tell the truth"	dh
110	i started a theft ring at my work as a teenager for over 5 years	"Not actually a theft ring but I don’t really know how to describe it. Accepted bribes to commit theft for others?

I worked in food & beverage, as a cashier in a very small restaurant/cafe type thing. Our little cafe branched off the main building where it was pretty much just me, a cook, and a couple other cashiers (rotating working days). Managers rarely came out to our location unless we called them or they were bored. We only really served a very specific crowd with pretty much the same people everyday.  

One day, a regular customer came up to me and ordered and stated he didn’t have money on him and asked if we could start a “tab”, on paper for IOU’s. I said sure. Eventually he just kept adding things to the tab and said he would pay it off when the number was a little bigger. 

One day when nobody was in the restaurant he said to me that he would pay me directly a percentage of his tab and that I would just make it disappear..  so when his tab was over $100, he would give me like $40-60”ish and I would just rip up his tab like nothing happened. I never once put any of his food into the system, just wrote it down on a loose piece of paper and kept it in the drawer. Other cashiers could add things to his tab but could not cash it out. 
 
When other cashiers would ask where his tab went, I would tell them he paid it off and I would print out a long fake receipt showing that he “paid” - and they believed me. I told them only I could cash out his tab since I was “Stand Captain”.. 

1-2 more regulars caught on and did this as well. I only did it for the regulars I trusted. 
Eventually after the years went by I got a little comfortable and I would lie to the regulars and say their tab was higher than it was just to get a little more money. I would say $200 instead of $150, nothing too extreme

I mean as a 15-18 year old, getting $40-80 pocket cash here and there was the BEST thing. I actually saved enough from the theft, working wage and tips to buy my first car. 
Now I worked for a MILLION-BILLION dollar company. Im glad I did not work for a family owned business at the time. 

Looking back at it, I didn’t even comprehend that was theft.. now I’m like omg jail time. I knew I shouldn’t have been doing what I was doing but I wanted the cash, got away with it and didn’t think it was a crime. 

I mean I don’t exactly regret it… my excuse is now, that these were grown men, knowing exactly what they were doing, asking a 15 year old to commit theft. Maybe they thought if I got caught, I was a minor so the penalty wouldn’t be bad? Or that’s how rich people stay rich, by being cheap and comiting crimes ?

I could NEVER do that now. A piece of lint once fell out of my pocket in the grocery store and I picked it up immediately because I thought karma would get me for littering … welcome to adulthood anxiety. Teenager me had BALLS.

111	I caused a girl to have to get glasses for the rest of her life 	"I feel so guilty - it was an accident but I still feel guilt. 

In grade 1 or 2, it was winter and recess. I told a girl to go down the tallest slide on her knees (it was fun for me) and she did. But right at the bottom she twisted or lost her balance or something and smashed her face off the end of the slide. When she got up she had her hand over her eye and it was bleeding above the eyebrow (didn’t seem too bad but I was a kid so idk). 

She went home at break and when she came to school the next day, she ended up having to get stitches and glasses. I’m almost certain she wore glasses for the whole year. I changed schools the year after but I feel like she needs them permanently. 

What guilts me more, aside the fact that she needed stitches and glasses all because I told her to go down the slide in a dangerous way, all I actually cared about, was that I was going to get in trouble for getting her hurt.

112	I forgot to pass along a check meant for my friend’s mom	"When I was in my sophomore year of high school, my dad was the treasurer of the booster club for our theatre department and Ms. L (fake name) was the president. Ms. L would always go above and beyond volunteering to help out with stuff for productions and for our musical she made these elaborate and beautiful horse heads for people to wear. My dad was meant to pay her for her labor but he and Ms. L never crossed paths so he gave me the check to give to my friend (Ms. L’s child). It was at the end of the year and I forgot to give it to them on the last two days of school and when I realized I felt really guilty and hid it in my room and blocked it from memory. It was only when I was with my dad and happened to run into Ms. L out somewhere that she mentioned never receiving the check. My dad was under the assumption I passed it on and I lied saying I did so Ms. L thought it was her kid that messed up and lost it or something and got mad at them. Now it’s been a few years and I still have the check hidden in my room but feel too bad and guilty about it to come clean. I’m pretty sure they’ve all forgotten it by now and Ms. L’s kid has never said anything to me about it so I’m probably in the clear but I still realized I did something wrong and I feel to guilty to throw the check away even though it’s long expired by now :(

114	I’m not going to tell my new roommate I found bed bugs	"It’s fucking horrible, I know. I’m turning myself inside out trying to think of the right way to handle this situation. I’ve never thought of myself as particularly selfish, and I’m a terrible liar. Everything about this is antithetical to who I am as a person. So why am I considering doing such a despicable thing?

My new roommate, Megan (29F) and I (22F) met two months ago after finding each other on one of those roommate apps. The age gap is a little big, I’ll admit, but it hasn’t really presented an issue yet. Because I work with local housing programs at my job, I’m more knowledgeable than most twenty-somethings about housing policy and landlords. Megan, although 29, lived with family for the first half of her twenties and has lived in student housing or been couch surfing for the latter half. As a result, she has never lived on her own before and is at a loss when it comes to renting. In addition, personality-wise I’m a pessimistic and jaded 58-year-old in the body of a 22-year old, and Megan is a little naive by nature. So it kind of fits.

Megan and I have never lived together before and are little more than strangers, but we’ve also spent the last two months getting to know each other as well as we possibly can. Although Megan is staying with a friend and has no deadline for moving, my current lease is up at the end of June. Two months seemed like plenty of time to establish a solid roommate relationship. Lucky for us, we get along extremely well. Both our habits and lifestyles seem to compliment each other. Since we met, we’ve been apartment hunting. We were ready to sign a few different leases, but all of them fell through at one point or another for reasons outside our control. But last week, we finally signed the lease on a great apartment, thank God. Our official move-in date is June 22. Everything seems to be going great on that front.

Enter the bed bugs. I found a bed bug in the bedroom of my current apartment a little over three weeks ago. I had a white trash bag sitting on the floor, and I saw a little black bug, the size of a small appleseed, crawling on the plastic. I instantly recognized it and submitted a maintenance request to my property manager that same day, with a picture attached. That was Sunday, at the beginning of May. I put in the request and then forgot about it for a few days. I figured an exterminator would come by soon and the problem would be resolved quickly. I even wondered if maybe I’d been lucky, and it was just the one.

Ten days later, on a Wednesday, I decided to check for bugs. I hadn’t seen a thing since then, and I hoped that maybe I’d been wrong about it being a bed bug. I lifted up my mattress and found nothing. And then I looked over my box spring. Still nothing. I sighed in relief, and turned the box spring over so I could examine the underside. That’s when I found at least 20 live bed bugs, from so-small-I-can-barely-see to ridiculously-bulbous-and-large, skittering along the bottom edges. There were also at least a dozen pale white eggs, so small I’d have missed them, if it weren’t for the rest. I think I stopped breathing. Earlier that week, I’d lost some faith in the exterminator and bought a can of Raid foam spray. I immediately grabbed that can and began spraying everything I could. I took lots of pictures and collected the biggest bugs in a jar filled with rubbing alcohol. I’d started to wonder if I’d need evidence, if maybe the exterminator and my PM just weren’t worried enough. Well, they would be now.

As I sprayed and sprayed, and as the hours ticked by, I became angrier and angrier. I wondered why no one had come yet. Even then, angry as I was, I could understand why there was no urgency. It’s possible the exterminator and my PM didn’t believe my roommate and me, picture or no. You see, a few months back, my current roommate, Ash (20NB) knocked on my door late one night and told me they’d found a bed bug crawling on one of their stuffed animals. Perfectly calm, I asked to see it, but they said they didn’t have it. As soon as they saw the bug, they squished it immediately and flushed it down the toilet. While this might have made sense to them at the moment, I was furious. Although I’d never had bed bugs before, I knew that there were lots of bed bug look-alikes. It could have been practically anything. Without evidence, the only thing we could do was act as if it was a bed bug, and that meant we would need to panic. And panic we did. Ash and I stripped our beds bare and spent the next few hours running all of our bedclothes through the dryer. Then we checked every inch of our rooms for more evidence of bugs. Nothing. Nothing but nothing. They sent in an exterminator who sprayed down Ash’s mattress, and who then told us to spray the furniture down with rubbing alcohol and remain vigilant. And then, once no more bugs were found, we both moved on.

Cut to now. I don’t know if the bed bugs I found came in with me or Ash recently, or if they’re just the result of what Ash found all those months ago. I don’t know if they came from up or downstairs, or if they’ve been here since before we moved in a year ago, waiting and dormant. I live in a duplex, so there’s every possibility they came through vents or contact with my neighbors. For some reason, I feel like they’re new, and I think Ash was mistaken that first time. But at the end of the day, there’s no way of really knowing.

That Wednesday night, I was awake until 3am, combing through the mattress and box spring, spraying and grabbing bugs with tweezers. I grabbed what fabric I could and ran up and down the stairs, throwing everything into the dryer and cooking my belongings on the highest heat possible. It seemed like it would never end. I think I had entered some kind of frenzied mania and couldn’t rest. The old floors creaked something awful, and I knew my downstairs neighbors would be enraged by all the noise, but I couldn’t find it in me to care. Ash was gone that night, and I was alone. I texted Ash updates as I cleaned, and I called both my PM and the exterminator directly, leaving voicemails for both of them.

The exterminator must have heard the panic in my voice loud and clear that morning, because he showed up the very next day at 10am and sprayed my bed with insecticide while I was at work. Ash let him in. In the end, even with all the evidence I provided, even with the jar full of dead bugs sitting on my nightstand, he still didn’t believe me. He called me afterward and said he couldn’t find a single bug in my box spring. I couldn’t believe it, and part of me wondered if he’d half assed the spray job because of it.

That Wednesday marked the beginning of my troubled sleep. It’s when I started getting itchy red welts along my arms and shoulders, and when I spent most nights sitting up, scrolling through article after article about the best methods for eradicating bed bugs. They’re nocturnal, you know, and they hide during the day. The best time to look for them is in the early hours of the morning, around 2 or 3am. Every other day, I’d flip my bed and check the seams with tweezers and a flashlight. I’ve found 3-5 bugs on the mattress since then, but that’s about it.

This would be the kind of thing to break me. It’s been a very, very hard year. It started last summer when my car was totaled in an accident – not my fault, but the other guy had expired insurance and, well, you know. I was still in college at the time and had to pull out seven grand in additional student loans to afford a new car. This led to a chain reaction of debt, and I’ve been sinking deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit. I also moved out for the first time a year ago. Yep, that’s right – this is my first apartment. Yippee! I’ve been working a job that I hate but can’t leave for the past year as well. I’m thrilled to say that I was offered the job of my dreams and will be starting next month. But I will also be moving to the new apartment that same weekend. My best friend was supposed to help me move, but she backed out because of the bugs, and now it looks like I’ll be moving all on my own (and no, I can’t afford movers).

It’s strange how so many life events seem to occur around the same time. I’m under so much stress, it’s like the universe is trying to kill me. Discovering bed bugs right when things seem to finally be looking up is the worst kind of irony.

I spent a weekend wallowing in self pity. I gave myself that time to feel sorry for myself and complain to my close friends and family – the only ones I could trust with this kind of a secret. And then I picked myself back up and started drawing up a plan. I am well on my way to becoming a certified bed bug expert. I have a list of methods for resolving a bed bug infestation, and if I can put these methods into a defined process, then maybe I can beat this thing. Maybe, just maybe, I can get this situation resolved to the point where I can move to the new apartment, and the bugs won’t be traveling with me. I don’t want to bog this post down with specific cleaning details, but as a general overview, I’ve been undergoing a combination of routine vacuuming, scrubbing, steam cleaning, at-home heat treating, air tight sealing, DE dusting, and discarding. I’ve been changing out of sealed bags when I leave the house to avoid carrying bugs on me. I’m hoping to get 2-3 rounds of insecticide sprays from my landlord’s pest company before I move out completely (the next spray on schedule is June 5). I’ve discarded almost all of my furniture, and most of my belongings will be sealed away in storage for at least two years to ensure any remaining bugs are dead. I’ve vacummed, steamed, dusted, and permanently encased my mattress and box spring. Essentially, I’m throwing everything I possibly can at the wall until something sticks.

So that brings us back to this terrible decision I have to make – do I tell Megan about the bed bugs? This might be the worst thing I could ever do. It’s immoral and unethical on every level, and so unbelievably selfish. I’m putting Megan at the risk of an infestation without her consent. And it’s not just any kind of pest infestation, but one of the worst. I’ve heard that most would prefer cockroaches over bed bugs, because at least cockroaches can be killed using poison. Bed bugs, unfortunately, have evolved to survive most pesticides. As such, they are almost impossible to eradicate. That’s why there’s no such thing as a silver bullet method – you have to take extreme action for every method you can think of.

I’m going round and round in my head, trying to weigh my options here.

Option 1 – Tell Megan right now about the bed bugs. Fun fact about Megan: she’s deathly terrified of bugs and insects in general, and the mere possibility of bed bugs would send her into a coma. She’d drop me as a roommate, plain and simple. Even if I’m on the lease, she’d find a way to ensure I never enter that apartment.

Option 2 – Find a new roommate. With a month before my lease is up, I’d be thrown into the desperate situation of finding a new roommate and an apartment on extremely short notice. While I could maybe pull that off, it’d probably go rotten eventually because we’d either not be compatible or, more likely, I’d have to tell them about the bed bugs regardless. Who in their right mind would rent with me knowing that? I wouldn’t.

Option 3 – What about Ash, my current roommate? Ash is moving in with their partner of four months and does not want me around. More to the point, Ash has some pretty intense conflict avoidance. Whenever things get hard, they tend to bolt. The day after we found out we had bed bugs, they packed what they could and have been living at their partner’s for over two weeks. While I was digging for ways to fix this and cleaning our apartment top to bottom, they were avoiding the apartment completely, hoping the problem would go away on its own. So that’s not really an option.

Option 4 – Could I try to sign another lease in my current apartment? There’s a few reasons why this couldn’t work. For one thing, this house is over a hundred years old, filled with an infinite amount of cracks and crevices in the floors, the walls, and the ceiling. If I stayed, the bed bugs wouldn’t be going anywhere. The only way to possibly eliminate them would be for everyone to move out and for an exterminator to spray every inch of this place and then some. Even then, it probably wouldn’t work because they’d have burrowed deep into the floorboards to wait out the insecticide, and they’d just resurface in a year or so. Likewise, I’ve burned some serious bridges with the PM company and my downstairs neighbors and I’m not on good terms with either, for reasons I won’t go into here.

Option 5 – Couch surf with someone. Throw my belongings into storage and find another place to stay short-term or long-term. Same result as Option 2 – if I came to you, asking for shelter, and you knew I had bed bugs, would you let me stay in your house? Even though I take all my precautions, there is still a very slight possibility I could carry a single bug into your house. Would you take that risk? Even if someone consented, I couldn’t bear it if I accidentally carried bed bugs into the home of a friend or family member. Even if it technically wouldn’t be my fault, I wouldn’t forgive myself for making that decision. Also, my small collection of friends and family have told me point blank that I’m not allowed into their homes, even just to visit. So that’s out.

Option 6 – Find a place to live on my own without implicating a new roommate. You might remember me mentioning my bottomless pit of at least three kinds of debt. Add to that my feeble salary and the shithole of an economy we’ve got on our hands, and you know why I’ve accepted that I’ll be living with roommates for at least another ten years. I just can’t afford it, otherwise that’s where my mind would have been, too.

Option 7 – Don’t tell Megan. Go about my precautions and cleaning process, continue to have the exterminator spray the place down, and continue to be hypervigilant for the months and years to come. If I’m lucky, and if I do everything right, we might never need to have the conversation. This last one is what I’m leaning into the most, and I know that makes me a coward.

I’m not thinking clearly, and I know that. I have two jobs, one full-time and one part-time, and I’m using energy drinks every day just to stay awake, something I don’t like doing. I had so many plans and vacations scheduled for this summer, and every single one has gone straight out the window. In the past year, I had collected a number of furniture items (a couch, a desk, a dresser, and a new mattress and box spring, to name a few) that are all on the curb, or soon will be. I’m starting over from scratch, and have flushed hundreds (soon to be thousands) of dollars down the drain. Suffice to say, my mental health has deteriorated. I’m exhausted and scared, and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown and I’m tearing at the seams. The worst part is that I can’t really talk to anyone about it, because the fear of bed bugs can do more harm than the bugs themselves.

I’ve been doing everything I possibly can to fix this, all on my own. My friends don’t want to be anywhere near me, and my mother and sister are empathetic to my problem, but have no way to help. No one will step foot in my house, not even my current roommate who still lives here. While there’s a possibility I can resolve this before moving, there’s a small part of me that knows, several months from now, I will find more bedbugs. I will have brought Megan into this mess without telling her, and that will be what kills me.

I’m sorry. I’m trying very hard to think rationally, but I’m just so tired. I’ve never felt so hopeless and depressed. I’ve been talking to my therapist about it, but she hasn’t really been helping. So I guess now I’m turning to prostrating myself in front of a jury composed of Internet strangers.

So what’s the verdict? What would you do?

I'm posting this to multiple threads, hoping to pick up some traction. I'm in desperate need of advice and opinions.

Edit: I am leaving the apartment I live in (where I found the bed bugs) and will be moving into a new apartment altogether with Megan. I'm trying to get rid of them so I don't carry any with me to the new place. Sorry for any confusion.

Edit2: I'm sorry this is such a long post. It started out as a personal brain dump that I copy and pasted into a Reddit post with very few edits.

enter the bed bugs i found a bed bug in the bedroom of my current apartment a little over three weeks ago i had a white trash bag sitting on the floor and i saw a little black bug the size of a small appleseed crawling on the plastic i instantly recognized it and submitted a maintenance request to my property manager that same day with a picture attached that was sunday at the beginning of may i put in the request and then forgot about it for a few days i figured an exterminator would come by soon and the problem would be resolved quickly i even wondered if maybe id been lucky and it was just the one

ten days later on a wednesday i decided to check for bugs i hadnt seen a thing since then and i hoped that maybe id been wrong about it being a bed bug i lifted up my mattress and found nothing and then i looked over my box spring still nothing i sighed in relief and turned the box spring over so i could examine the underside thats when i found at least  live bed bugs from sosmallicanbarelysee to ridiculouslybulbousandlarge skittering along the bottom edges there were also at least a dozen pale white eggs so small id have missed them if it werent for the rest i think i stopped breathing earlier that week id lost some faith in the exterminator and bought a can of raid foam spray i immediately grabbed that can and began spraying everything i could i took lots of pictures and collected the biggest bugs in a jar filled with rubbing alcohol id started to wonder if id need evidence if maybe the exterminator and my pm just werent worried enough well they would be now

as i sprayed and sprayed and as the hours ticked by i became angrier and angrier i wondered why no one had come yet even then angry as i was i could understand why there was no urgency its possible the exterminator and my pm didnt believe my roommate and me picture or no you see a few months back my current roommate ash nb knocked on my door late one night and told me theyd found a bed bug crawling on one of their stuffed animals perfectly calm i asked to see it but they said they didnt have it as soon as they saw the bug they squished it immediately and flushed it down the toilet while this might have made sense to them at the moment i was furious although id never had bed bugs before i knew that there were lots of bed bug lookalikes it could have been practically anything without evidence the only thing we could do was act as if it was a bed bug and that meant we would need to panic and panic we did ash and i stripped our beds bare and spent the next few hours running all of our bedclothes through the dryer then we checked every inch of our rooms for more evidence of bugs nothing nothing but nothing they sent in an exterminator who sprayed down ashs mattress and who then told us to spray the furniture down with rubbing alcohol and remain vigilant and then once no more bugs were found we both moved on

cut to now i dont know if the bed bugs i found came in with me or ash recently or if theyre just the result of what ash found all those months ago i dont know if they came from up or downstairs or if theyve been here since before we moved in a year ago waiting and dormant i live in a duplex so theres every possibility they came through vents or contact with my neighbors for some reason i feel like theyre new and i think ash was mistaken that first time but at the end of the day theres no way of really knowing

that wednesday night i was awake until am combing through the mattress and box spring spraying and grabbing bugs with tweezers i grabbed what fabric i could and ran up and down the stairs throwing everything into the dryer and cooking my belongings on the highest heat possible it seemed like it would never end i think i had entered some kind of frenzied mania and couldnt rest the old floors creaked something awful and i knew my downstairs neighbors would be enraged by all the noise but i couldnt find it in me to care ash was gone that night and i was alone i texted ash updates as i cleaned and i called both my pm and the exterminator directly leaving voicemails for both of them

the exterminator must have heard the panic in my voice loud and clear that morning because he showed up the very next day at am and sprayed my bed with insecticide while i was at work ash let him in in the end even with all the evidence i provided even with the jar full of dead bugs sitting on my nightstand he still didnt believe me he called me afterward and said he couldnt find a single bug in my box spring i couldnt believe it and part of me wondered if hed half assed the spray job because of it

that wednesday marked the beginning of my troubled sleep its when i started getting itchy red welts along my arms and shoulders and when i spent most nights sitting up scrolling through article after article about the best methods for eradicating bed bugs theyre nocturnal you know and they hide during the day the best time to look for them is in the early hours of the morning around  or am every other day id flip my bed and check the seams with tweezers and a flashlight ive found  bugs on the mattress since then but thats about it

this would be the kind of thing to break me its been a very very hard year it started last summer when my car was totaled in an accident  not my fault but the other guy had expired insurance and well you know i was still in college at the time and had to pull out seven grand in additional student loans to afford a new car this led to a chain reaction of debt and ive been sinking deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit i also moved out for the first time a year ago yep thats right  this is my first apartment yippee ive been working a job that i hate but cant leave for the past year as well im thrilled to say that i was offered the job of my dreams and will be starting next month but i will also be moving to the new apartment that same weekend my best friend was supposed to help me move but she backed out because of the bugs and now it looks like ill be moving all on my own and no i cant afford movers

its strange how so many life events seem to occur around the same time im under so much stress its like the universe is trying to kill me discovering bed bugs right when things seem to finally be looking up is the worst kind of irony

i spent a weekend wallowing in self pity i gave myself that time to feel sorry for myself and complain to my close friends and family  the only ones i could trust with this kind of a secret and then i picked myself back up and started drawing up a plan i am well on my way to becoming a certified bed bug expert i have a list of methods for resolving a bed bug infestation and if i can put these methods into a defined process then maybe i can beat this thing maybe just maybe i can get this situation resolved to the point where i can move to the new apartment and the bugs wont be traveling with me i dont want to bog this post down with specific cleaning details but as a general overview ive been undergoing a combination of routine vacuuming scrubbing steam cleaning athome heat treating air tight sealing de dusting and discarding ive been changing out of sealed bags when i leave the house to avoid carrying bugs on me im hoping to get  rounds of insecticide sprays from my landlords pest company before i move out completely the next spray on schedule is june  ive discarded almost all of my furniture and most of my belongings will be sealed away in storage for at least two years to ensure any remaining bugs are dead ive vacummed steamed dusted and permanently encased my mattress and box spring essentially im throwing everything i possibly can at the wall until something sticks

so that brings us back to this terrible decision i have to make  do i tell megan about the bed bugs this might be the worst thing i could ever do its immoral and unethical on every level and so unbelievably selfish im putting megan at the risk of an infestation without her consent and its not just any kind of pest infestation but one of the worst ive heard that most would prefer cockroaches over bed bugs because at least cockroaches can be killed using poison bed bugs unfortunately have evolved to survive most pesticides as such they are almost impossible to eradicate thats why theres no such thing as a silver bullet method  you have to take extreme action for every method you can think of

im going round and round in my head trying to weigh my options here

option   tell megan right now about the bed bugs fun fact about megan shes deathly terrified of bugs and insects in general and the mere possibility of bed bugs would send her into a coma shed drop me as a roommate plain and simple even if im on the lease shed find a way to ensure i never enter that apartment

option   find a new roommate with a month before my lease is up id be thrown into the desperate situation of finding a new roommate and an apartment on extremely short notice while i could maybe pull that off itd probably go rotten eventually because wed either not be compatible or more likely id have to tell them about the bed bugs regardless who in their right mind would rent with me knowing that i wouldnt

option   what about ash my current roommate ash is moving in with their partner of four months and does not want me around more to the point ash has some pretty intense conflict avoidance whenever things get hard they tend to bolt the day after we found out we had bed bugs they packed what they could and have been living at their partners for over two weeks while i was digging for ways to fix this and cleaning our apartment top to bottom they were avoiding the apartment completely hoping the problem would go away on its own so thats not really an option

option   could i try to sign another lease in my current apartment theres a few reasons why this couldnt work for one thing this house is over a hundred years old filled with an infinite amount of cracks and crevices in the floors the walls and the ceiling if i stayed the bed bugs wouldnt be going anywhere the only way to possibly eliminate them would be for everyone to move out and for an exterminator to spray every inch of this place and then some even then it probably wouldnt work because theyd have burrowed deep into the floorboards to wait out the insecticide and theyd just resurface in a year or so likewise ive burned some serious bridges with the pm company and my downstairs neighbors and im not on good terms with either for reasons i wont go into here

option   couch surf with someone throw my belongings into storage and find another place to stay shortterm or longterm same result as option   if i came to you asking for shelter and you knew i had bed bugs would you let me stay in your house even though i take all my precautions there is still a very slight possibility i could carry a single bug into your house would you take that risk even if someone consented i couldnt bear it if i accidentally carried bed bugs into the home of a friend or family member even if it technically wouldnt be my fault i wouldnt forgive myself for making that decision also my small collection of friends and family have told me point blank that im not allowed into their homes even just to visit so thats out

option   find a place to live on my own without implicating a new roommate you might remember me mentioning my bottomless pit of at least three kinds of debt add to that my feeble salary and the shithole of an economy weve got on our hands and you know why ive accepted that ill be living with roommates for at least another ten years i just cant afford it otherwise thats where my mind would have been too

option   dont tell megan go about my precautions and cleaning process continue to have the exterminator spray the place down and continue to be hypervigilant for the months and years to come if im lucky and if i do everything right we might never need to have the conversation this last one is what im leaning into the most and i know that makes me a coward

im not thinking clearly and i know that i have two jobs one fulltime and one parttime and im using energy drinks every day just to stay awake something i dont like doing i had so many plans and vacations scheduled for this summer and every single one has gone straight out the window in the past year i had collected a number of furniture items a couch a desk a dresser and a new mattress and box spring to name a few that are all on the curb or soon will be im starting over from scratch and have flushed hundreds soon to be thousands of dollars down the drain suffice to say my mental health has deteriorated im exhausted and scared and i dont know what to do i feel like im constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown and im tearing at the seams the worst part is that i cant really talk to anyone about it because the fear of bed bugs can do more harm than the bugs themselves

ive been doing everything i possibly can to fix this all on my own my friends dont want to be anywhere near me and my mother and sister are empathetic to my problem but have no way to help no one will step foot in my house not even my current roommate who still lives here while theres a possibility i can resolve this before moving theres a small part of me that knows several months from now i will find more bedbugs i will have brought megan into this mess without telling her and that will be what kills me

im sorry im trying very hard to think rationally but im just so tired ive never felt so hopeless and depressed ive been talking to my therapist about it but she hasnt really been helping so i guess now im turning to prostrating myself in front of a jury composed of internet strangers

so whats the verdict what would you do

im posting this to multiple threads hoping to pick up some traction im in desperate need of advice and opinions

edit i am leaving the apartment i live in where i found the bed bugs and will be moving into a new apartment altogether with megan im trying to get rid of them so i dont carry any with me to the new place sorry for any confusion

edit im sorry this is such a long post it started out as a personal brain dump that i copy and pasted into a reddit post with very few edits theres a lot of extra bits i probably didnt need"	dtd
115	I tried to put my arm on my colleague's shoulder multiple times	"Several years ago, I (male, then in late 20s) was friends with a female colleague and I was walking her home. I liked her but apparently she didn't like me romantically. I tried to put my arm on her shoulder and she swirled out of it. I tried to do a few times and got the same reaction. So I eventually stopped doing that and took her home.

After taking her home, on my way back I realized that I was trying to touch her without her consent. I apologized to her via text message and she said it was okay. After that we remained friends and did friendly activies, such as playing sports together and exchanging gifts. We are still friends I think.

But the fact that I tried to touch her without her consent still haunts me after many years. I apologized to her again last year and she still said it was okay. But I can't forgive myself even if she forgave me. I feel like the worst person ever.

I don't know this is whether because of my OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) or because I really did something that bad and should feel eternally bad about it. I can't rate my past objectively.

What if other people find out that I did this? Will my friends stop being my friends? Will I lose my job?

Am I still qualified to find a romantic partner in my life? If so, should I confess to my future partner about what I did? Would it be dishonest to hide this past from her?

Please rate the badness of what I did in your opinion."	1d8o4ng	i tried to put my arm on my colleagues shoulder multiple times	"several years ago i male then in late s was friends with a female colleague and i was walking her home i liked her but apparently she didnt like me romantically i tried to put my arm on her shoulder and she swirled out of it i tried to do a few times and got the same reaction so i eventually stopped doing that and took her home

116	Wasted a larger amount of money because of mental health	"So I attribute making this mistake to the worsening and more long-term effects of my anxiety.

I had to make a decision on a school and chose the much more expensive (and slightly more reputable one) at first based on prestige cause I thought that’s how you get ahead in life.

But I just couldn’t deal with having him pay 20k for an Media and Film Studies Masters, even from a very good school cause they’re just so manipulative with money.

118	I don't follow proper procedures at work due to coworkers' errors	My coworkers have a tendency to stop using an item in middle of it's shelf-life and throw it at the dumpster before it has been used. Before it gets thrown at the landfill, I hijack it and take it back to use. There might be 6 opened packages of still supposedly usable goods and they don't want to use it, instead they open a new one. I also improvise opened dates; I see a open package that's in use, I will put a date on it that it was opened yesterday. I justify my bad behauvior by reminding myself, that my coworkers too do shady things all the time. I also have environmental OCD. I've been caught few times, and some of my coworkers do the same thing as I do. It's unlikely that I cause any harm, because the product lasts 1 week after opening. Leaving almost full opened products at the far end of some cabinet is really common. I've mentioned this to my boss and I've filed rapports, so I decided to take matters in my own hands.	1d7up55	i dont follow proper procedures at work due to coworkers errors	my coworkers have a tendency to stop using an item in middle of its shelflife and throw it at the dumpster before it has been used before it gets thrown at the landfill i hijack it and take it back to use there might be  opened packages of still supposedly usable goods and they dont want to use it instead they open a new one i also improvise opened dates i see a open package thats in use i will put a date on it that it was opened yesterday i justify my bad behauvior by reminding myself that my coworkers too do shady things all the time i also have environmental ocd ive been caught few times and some of my coworkers do the same thing as i do its unlikely that i cause any harm because the product lasts  week after opening leaving almost full opened products at the far end of some cabinet is really common ive mentioned this to my boss and ive filed rapports so i decided to take matters in my own hands	dup

I bought my adult-doll (xxx toy) a couple of years ago and hid it in the hunting room, hidden from my wife. Last year I decided to throw away the doll. It felt completely wrong to use it in secret from the wife.

Decided to get rid of the doll somewhere out in nature (Isn't room in a normal boss bin and it's embarrassing to take it to the landfill). Therefore had a spade to dig it into the forest. Drove off.. But I suddenly had bad timing and panicked and thus ended up throwing it on the side of the road.

Tragicomic as it all was, it ended up with the doll being found by people the next day. Someone who was on their way to work and got a little shock... It made headlines in the local newspaper, some regional and one national newspaper .. The DD was never traced back to me.

125	When I was a kid I cut my own hair and blamed it on my younger sister	When I was a kid, probably about 9 or 10, I cut my own hair. I was old enough to know that if I cut all of it, my parents would know and be furious, so instead I cut just a small section no bigger than the width of a pencil right in the middle of my head all the way to the scalp. I wanted the hair to braid and decorate my barbies with. I stabbed them in the head to make a hole and stuck the hair in it. I thought that if I cut it at the scalp, no one would ever know. And it did work for, like, a week until my hair started to grow again. I had what looked like either a pecock crown or the kid from the diary of a wimpy kid for ages. Of course, I denied it and blamed my 5-year-old sister. I was persistent, and my parents believed that she snuck into my room and cut my hair in my sleep. It's been 10 years, and I still haven't admitted the truth and bring it up every time I see her (we live far apart, so probably 2-3 times a year). The worst part is that I think I have gaslit her into believing it too. I'm sure I'll admit it one day to her, but no time soon. 	1d4bkpb	when i was a kid i cut my own hair and blamed it on my younger sister	when i was a kid probably about  or  i cut my own hair i was old enough to know that if i cut all of it my parents would know and be furious so instead i cut just a small section no bigger than the width of a pencil right in the middle of my head all the way to the scalp i wanted the hair to braid and decorate my barbies with i stabbed them in the head to make a hole and stuck the hair in it i thought that if i cut it at the scalp no one would ever know and it did work for like a week until my hair started to grow again i had what looked like either a pecock crown or the kid from the diary of a wimpy kid for ages of course i denied it and blamed my yearold sister i was persistent and my parents believed that she snuck into my room and cut my hair in my sleep its been  years and i still havent admitted the truth and bring it up every time i see her we live far apart so probably  times a year the worst part is that i think i have gaslit her into believing it too im sure ill admit it one day to her but no time soon 	dbkpb

They were interested in my school as I was in my uniform. Naturally, they asked me about my school. And I panicked. I knew some basic sign language. So, I started to sign. They were confused at first but caught up real fast. They smiled kindly at me and asked my name. I showed them my school ID. One of them gave me a box of cupcakes she bought. And patted my shoulder wishing me a great day. I felt so bad. More after I ate the cupcakes.

I'm more or less his only friend too, and we've been reliant upon each other for 3 years.

A month or so ago someone from another friend group at school asked Nick if he wanted to hang out with them. I immediately became terrified of the idea that Nick could potentially leave me and join this other group of people (who, by the way, despise me) so I immediately started to convince him that it was a bad idea, eventually leading to me making flat out false screenshots of them speaking about Nick negatively to prove that it wasn't worth it. He eventually agreed with me and decided to not go through with the plans.

Now I know for a fact that he'd be better off with them than me, plain and simple. They're objectively better company than hanging around with me, and I know he'd be much happier, but my fear of abandonment is so strong and I so cannot imagine a life where I don't have a singular friend that I can't bring myself to let go of him. And now the guilt is eating me up alive, it's all I can think about. Every time I see him all I can think of is how I'm denying him a better social life out of my own selfishness. I think he's noticed something's up with me, he asked me recently why I looked so miserable all of a sudden but I cant bear to tell him what I did. I know for a fact he, like me, wants to branch out and have other friends. I should have let him give it a try but I didn't, and now I feel so terrible about it. He deserves far better, and I really don't know what to do. We're both definitely not in the best place mentally either, and I know for a fact he deserves friends who actually have their lives sorted out, unlike myself, but again, my brain cannot convince itself to actually do what's right and tell him the truth, that I ruined his chance of making new friends for my own selfish gain. I don't know what to do."	1d3lo51	i sabotaged my only friends attempt to make other friends so that they dont leave me	"im  as is this friend who for simplicitys sake i will refer to as nick and weve known each other since  ive always been terrible at making friends and i truly mean it when i say that he is the only actual friend i have other than basic superficial friends who i dont interact with outside of school im more or less his only friend too and weve been reliant upon each other for  years

129	I Convinced A Neighborhood Kid That I Had A Twin And I Spoke A Different Language. I Dont Have Either	"When I (19F) was in kindergarten my apartment complex had a play ground close by. I would constantly go to that park with my younger brother and goof off for hours. There was a little boy who would come by and always try to play with us. I convinced my brother to speak a fake language and act like we had no idea what he was saying but would still play with him. This included a lot of pretending to not understand what was happening but the little boy would go along with it. One day at the park by myself the little boy came up and I had forgotten my ""language"". Obviously the little boy was shocked and thought I was lying the whole time. So I had to come clean...... im a twin and i speak english while my sister doesnt. Which is not true at all. Im not a twin and I dont speak another other languages.  From there on out when I wasn't with my brother I was my twin. Deep memory that randomly came up. I wonder if that little boy ever thinks about it.

130	In high school I stole from the grocery store where I worked.	"I worked at a grocery store and we had a “courtesy counter” where people would bring cans and bottles for cooperage. It was 5 cents for cans and 10 cents for longneck bottles. I would count the cans. If they had 25 cans, I would write down 125, open the register, give the customer $1.25, and put $5 in my pocket. I did this all the time.

I would also empty 12-packs of soda and refill them with beer, tape them shut, and buy them.

The store was a good place to work and the owners were good people. They still have no idea. I hate it. It gnaws at me."	1d2a3mi	in high school i stole from the grocery store where i worked	"i worked at a grocery store and we had a courtesy counter where people would bring cans and bottles for cooperage it was  cents for cans and  cents for longneck bottles i would count the cans if they had  cans i would write down  open the register give the customer  and put  in my pocket i did this all the time

131	I pretend to be at work to avoid social interactions	"I've seen confessions about pretending to have a job, but I actually have a job. I just pretend to work more hours than I actually do.

It started seven years ago when I had a controlling boyfriend, who I felt smothered and suffocated by. If I told him I needed alone time, he would show up or drive by my place unannounced. So I pretended to work on my days off. 

That relationship ended, but I continued to do it - with friends, family, and even other guys I dated. I was caught once and accused of cheating. I talked my way out of it, but I wonder what's worse - Cheating, or pretending to be at work to avoid spending time with my boyfriend?

I'm not even in a relationship right now, and I'm still doing it. I can't seem to stop. I'm really introverted and need more alone time than most people. It's easier to pretend to be at work than to say I don't feel like hanging out. 

And because I have a job, it's harder for me to get caught, because half the time I say I'm working, I actually am at work. I don't know if I'll ever stop...


EDIT:
Thanks for all the great feedback! I greatly appreciate it. To answer a few questions, I am on the spectrum, and I do have anxiety. I have trouble setting/ keeping boundaries, and I tend to let people push my limits or step over them completely. I have a hard time saying no, and I hate hurting people's feelings. 

I also do present as an extrovert in social situations, so I tend to make friends with people who are more social than me. In the past, I've dated guys who are more extroverted than I am. I have felt smothered and suffocated in most of my romantic relationships. I always thought there was something wrong with me, but I just didn't know how to fix it.

I am in therapy for severe C-PTSD, and I have an anxious-avoidant attachment style. I will keep trying to get better. Thank you!

132	I am a chronic litterbug, and I have littered probably over two hundred garbage bags.	Once a week at around 10 PM, I throw my trash bags into my car, drive to either a random neighbourhood or near the river (where I dump some of my trash bags into), and I litter the trash bags either in the middle of the road, or between peoples' parked automobiles (in the most bizarre places). Whenever I am in a fast food joint, such as a Burger King, I litter my garbage on the washroom floor or dump it on the side of the road.

133	I manipulated children into believing I had twin sister in kindergarten.	"This was so long ago, but I’ve seen some heinous confessions on this app and I find mine quite funny. Although I may be bias lol.

When I was in kindergarten I remember that I tried to convince everyone around me that I had a twin sister that looked and sounded exactly like me, and that everyday we would switch places.

I know that it sounds quite stupid and unbelievable, and yet I was like five years old and I’m pretty sure at least ten children believed me. 

I distinctly remember that multiple times a day kids would ask me about my twin and then the next day ask my ‘twin’ about me. I promise I had definitely tricked one kid into thinking I actually had a twin.

No adults ended up hearing about it, or they just didn’t care and left me alone to manipulate my classmates into believing stupid shit.

Can’t remember exactly when I stopped lying or if anyone confronted me about it. But I found this a lighter confession.

So… don’t yell at me for more information because I can’t help you with that."	1d1b5bg	i manipulated children into believing i had twin sister in kindergarten	"this was so long ago but ive seen some heinous confessions on this app and i find mine quite funny although i may be bias lol

134	I lied about my spanish to him and now I can't turn back	"A little background info I started talking to this guy romantically about a year ago and hes 3 years older than me. I was introduced to him by my best friend which is also his cousin who lives with him. So like I said before we've been on and off talking for about a year and a half. In addition he just moved to America in 2020 from mexico so he doesn't really know much english (when I first spoke to him he didn't know any at all). My friend also told me about him not speaking english when she first gave me his number so I was well aware of it. In that time I had already been learning spanish for a while (about 5 months) but I still wasn't anywhere near fluent but in my head i believed my spanish was good enough. 

The moment we started talking is when I realized DAMN. I didnt know bat shit in spanish but  he was so handsome I decided to settle with the deepl translator. There was many times he asked me how I learned spanish and many times he told me that my spanish was good. There was even a time where i jokingly said I don't speak spanish and he responded in spanish with ""Oh so have you been using a translator to talk with me😂""  and I responded back saying ""Once or twice"". I always think about that text because I feel like I shouldve been honest with him at that point. 

There was also times where he tried to call me and I had made an excuse and the conversations after that would be awkward. Now that time has passed its been more than calls ive made excuses for. There was multiple times he asked me to come over and I had to make an excuse because I was too scared to get caught on how little spanish i knew in person but how ""fluent"" i was in text. I always try to motivate myself to learn more spanish for him and others in general because of how beneficial it is but I can't bring myself to stay motivated. 

In a few months I will be attending his school and im bervous on if he ever sees me and tries to speak to me. Now he seems to be getting dry with me every time i make up a new excuse on why i cant go to his house. One time he even called me a ""mentirosa"" (liar) when i told him i couldnt. Hes told me many times that he only wants me and that he likes me but I don't want to commit with my lies. I don't know what to do and if i should just be honest but I also dont want to ruin my chances with him. At the moment I do know more spanish in the advanced to intermediate level but still not enough for a a day with a native.  

Update: Thank you for all the honest and nice feedback about my situation! I am going to tell him the truth today or tomorrow. I was supposed to tell him yesterday n I was too busy but... shocker I am going to his house next thursday!! So, hopefully you guys see that as an step forward and I will make sure to tell him today or tomorrow.

135	I stole from woolworths when I was younger and worked for them.	"I used to work out back and restock the shelves. The bosses would go home by 5pm and I'd be there alone till 9pm to deal woth everything. I was 17, last year of high school. I barely ate food during the day as my family were poor. 
The boss said if there's ever a broken carton or opened box on the shelves  I was to take it down and throw it in the bin. I'd throw hundreds of perfectly good food away.
So when the boss went home i would take the food, go to the cold room, eat and drink until I was full then get back to work. I was eating expensive bakery products to chocolates to anything and everything I could never afford.

136	I’ve been faking my nicotine withdrawals from my accountability friend	"This is not a story where I gave up vaping but secretly still do, but something else. 2 weeks ago me and a friend gave up vaping and to celebrate we are going to Zion National Park for a week long hiking and camping trip with our “stronger lungs” we made each other accountability partners and as far as I know we both are still in the game. 

I read up on withdrawal management and loaded up and made baskets with ibuprofen, Benadryl, mints, jolly ranchers, gum (non-nicotine) that people suggested to help quit. We even ran over our vapes in the Walmart parking lot. 

I do not have a single regret except I did not do it sooner. I honestly thank the lord above for it but when I tell you I had the tiniest levels of withdrawals from quitting nicotine that was a nasty habit for 4 years, I am not lying. I had a tiny headache on the third day but apart from that and just some minor “ooo a minty hit would be so nice” I am fine and I want my money back from all the time I wasted on that stupid habit. 

My friend is not in the same boat. I still get calls when we talk that she can’t sleep well, binge eats, migraines, etc. the first couple days every night she would be crying about how shit she felt. I am honestly proud that she didn’t go back. 

This isn’t about how I’m annoyed at her, I’m proud and the pact to be accountability partners makes it my responsibility to be there, because I thought I would be like that and I would like the same treatment from her. She’s never taken anger out on me. Different body reactions, I guess.

I didn’t want to discourage her or make her feel alone by saying my journey has been easy so I just try to match her energy. I lie and say I been having killer headaches and can’t sleep and am raging at tiny shit. Hell, I graduated college and am currently living with my parents until my grownup career starts and then I’m on my own, I’m stressed af and hate seeing my friend in pain so I cried with her. 

But it’s all been fake, I feel fine, had one minor headache that could have been from caffeine withdrawal cuz I didn’t have coffee that day. But I have zero cravings or anything, I just want us to better ourselves and quit the stupid habit.

138	I am an awful person who uses and manipulates people around me.	"I (19M) am an awful person. 
   I grew up in a very unhealthy household. My parents were addicts and my parents were neglectful and abusive. My older siblings were the only people around me who cared for me. And I have consistently lied and manipulated them. After my parents split up when I was 10, my parents remarried. My mother married a decent enough man. He was an angry person and he took it out on me, but he wasn't totally awful. I exaggerated about the way he treated me to my mother and she left him. 
    When my mom left him, I (17) moved in with my brother. He treated me well, but we argued about opinions. I payed him about 500 a month in rent. But it didn't work out because of our arguments. I then moved in with my oldest sibling.
    They were the sibling that raised me. I once again payed 500 a month. the plan was to save up and get my own place. I was saving, but I kept on impulsively spending money. I stayed with them for 2 years. I was welcome there but I never managed to make a Considerable savings. Every time they asked me about my savings I lied. I didn't want to but I couldn't bring myself to tell the truth. Once i started lying about that I found myself lying to other people. About anything. I do it because I feel like making things up about myself is the only way to make people like me.
   I feel like a deep void where a person should be.
I have moved but I'm still staying with a family member across the country. I don't know what to do. I constantly feel depressed and suicidal. I moved to try and start new. I have been trying to save again to some success, and I've been trying to stop lying. But my old lies come. Back to bite Me and I have to lie again to keep images up.
      The worst part is that I know something is severely wrong with me. I've known that from a young age. I've only ever felt sadness and anger. But I can't seem to help myself.

139	I was selling elementary school kids drugs... Kinda 	"When I was in elementary school, my mom used to stock up on SUPRADYN Energy. One day, I tried it and it was like a citrus explosion in my mouth, better than any orange juice I'd ever had. Whether it was my young taste buds or the actual flavor, I was hooked.

Fast forward to 5th grade, and Digimon mania was sweeping through my school. The craze wasn't just about watching the anime, there was this sticker collection book you had to fill with stickers hidden under yogurt lids. Being a massive Digimon fan, I knew every character, attack, evolution, and could belt out the opening theme by heart, I just couldn't let it slide. But there was a hitch, my family was pretty humble, and splurging on mountains of yogurt wasn’t an option. Asking my parents for extra cash was also out of the question.

So, I devised a plan. I started smuggling SUPRADYN Energy tablets and a 2L bottle to school, mixing up the ""magic potion"" in the bathroom, and selling cups of this “orange juice” to my classmates during recess. On my first day, the entire bottle was emptied in 5 minutes flat, business was booming!

For a whole week, I ran my little enterprise under the radar. None of the teachers noticed, except for the coolest one ever, my 4th-grade teacher, Mr. Sarhani (RIP, you were the realest). He actually found my scheme hilarious, especially after I explained my Digimon sticker dilemma.My mom never caught on because she thought my dad was using the tablets too.

 But eventually, the jig was up. Kids were bouncing off the walls with energy, and the teachers started asking questions. When they asked the kids what they had been snacking on, I realized, ""Oh no, it’s probably the juice I’m selling!"" So, I decided to quit while I was ahead.

In the end, I made enough money to almost complete my Digimon collection book. It wasn’t about the money though, those last few stickers were ultra-rare. But hey, I gave it my best shot and had a blast doing it!"	1czoi9f	i was selling elementary school kids drugs kinda 	"when i was in elementary school my mom used to stock up on supradyn energy one day i tried it and it was like a citrus explosion in my mouth better than any orange juice id ever had whether it was my young taste buds or the actual flavor i was hooked

fast forward to th grade and digimon mania was sweeping through my school the craze wasnt just about watching the anime there was this sticker collection book you had to fill with stickers hidden under yogurt lids being a massive digimon fan i knew every character attack evolution and could belt out the opening theme by heart i just couldnt let it slide but there was a hitch my family was pretty humble and splurging on mountains of yogurt wasnt an option asking my parents for extra cash was also out of the question

so i devised a plan i started smuggling supradyn energy tablets and a l bottle to school mixing up the magic potion in the bathroom and selling cups of this orange juice to my classmates during recess on my first day the entire bottle was emptied in  minutes flat business was booming

for a whole week i ran my little enterprise under the radar none of the teachers noticed except for the coolest one ever my thgrade teacher mr sarhani rip you were the realest he actually found my scheme hilarious especially after i explained my digimon sticker dilemmamy mom never caught on because she thought my dad was using the tablets too

 but eventually the jig was up kids were bouncing off the walls with energy and the teachers started asking questions when they asked the kids what they had been snacking on i realized oh no its probably the juice im selling so i decided to quit while i was ahead

in the end i made enough money to almost complete my digimon collection book it wasnt about the money though those last few stickers were ultrarare but hey i gave it my best shot and had a blast doing it"	czoif
140	Unknowingly selling a device that may not be usable for the next person. 	In context to my confession, I recently just moved out of state, which as most of us know is financially draining. With moving to this new state I needed a new Internet provider. To cut cost I bought a modem from the FB marketplace. To my surprise the company informed me I would still have to pay a rental fee for the modem because technically it was there's. With that in mind I refused to pay and sold it off to someone else. A few weeks pass and the person I sold it to says they cannot get it activated. Mind you I wrote in the description that a rental fee would still be necessary. I feel bad because they want a refund. 	1czo3ut	unknowingly selling a device that may not be usable for the next person 	in context to my confession i recently just moved out of state which as most of us know is financially draining with moving to this new state i needed a new internet provider to cut cost i bought a modem from the fb marketplace to my surprise the company informed me i would still have to pay a rental fee for the modem because technically it was theres with that in mind i refused to pay and sold it off to someone else a few weeks pass and the person i sold it to says they cannot get it activated mind you i wrote in the description that a rental fee would still be necessary i feel bad because they want a refund 	czout

If they’re obviously not what the job needs, they get booted off. Everything is fair until there’s a tie between a number of students, more than we can afford to hire. After careful evaluation, I choose to hire the top most charming and attractive girls, and the bottom of the barrel guys. It’s good for business.

142	I stole a joke and my parents still praise me for it 	 A less serious post on here. I’m a very funny person. Everyone always tells me I have a great sense of humor and I was voted class clown for my senior superlative. When I was younger I was doing a skit for my parents. I stole the joke from a vine I had seen. They erupted with laughter. They still reference the joke to this day and are always damned they never video taped it. 	1cxpe8x	i stole a joke and my parents still praise me for it 	 a less serious post on here im a very funny person everyone always tells me i have a great sense of humor and i was voted class clown for my senior superlative when i was younger i was doing a skit for my parents i stole the joke from a vine i had seen they erupted with laughter they still reference the joke to this day and are always damned they never video taped it 	cxpex
143	I sabotaged my only friend's attempt to make other friends so that they don't leave me.	"Throwaway account as this friend most definitely knows about my main Reddit account. I'm 18, as is this friend (who for simplicity's sake I will refer to as Nick), and we've known each other since 2021. I've always been terrible at making friends and I truly mean it when I say that he is the only actual friend I have (other than basic superficial ""friends"" who I don't interact with outside of school). I'm more or less his only friend too, and we've been reliant upon each other for 3 years.

A month or so ago someone from another friend group at school asked Nick if he wanted to hang out with them. I immediately became terrified of the idea that Nick could potentially leave me and join this other group of people (who, by the way, despise me) so I immediately started to convince him that it was a bad idea, eventually leading to me making flat out false screenshots of them speaking about Nick negatively to prove that it wasn't worth it. He eventually agreed with me and decided to not go through with the plans.

Now I know for a fact that he'd be better off with them than me, plain and simple. They're objectively better company than hanging around with me, and I know he'd be much happier, but my fear of abandonment is so strong and I so cannot imagine a life where I don't have a singular friend that I can't bring myself to let go of him. And now the guilt is eating me up alive, it's all I can think about. Every time I see him all I can think of is how I'm denying him a better social life out of my own selfishness. I think he's noticed something's up with me, he asked me recently why I looked so miserable all of a sudden but I cant bear to tell him what I did. I know for a fact he, like me, wants to branch out and have other friends. I should have let him give it a try but I didn't, and now I feel so terrible about it. He deserves far better, and I really don't know what to do. We're both definitely not in the best place mentally either, and I know for a fact he deserves friends who actually have their lives sorted out, unlike myself, but again, my brain cannot convince itself to actually do what's right and tell him the truth, that I ruined his chance of making new friends for my own selfish gain. I don't know what to do. 

Is confessing all this on Reddit the best course of action? Probably not. I'm just at a dead end."	1cxl3b3	i sabotaged my only friends attempt to make other friends so that they dont leave me	"throwaway account as this friend most definitely knows about my main reddit account im  as is this friend who for simplicitys sake i will refer to as nick and weve known each other since  ive always been terrible at making friends and i truly mean it when i say that he is the only actual friend i have other than basic superficial friends who i dont interact with outside of school im more or less his only friend too and weve been reliant upon each other for  years

144	I copied a goosebumps episode to win a competition	"
We had a competition to write a short narrative while I was in primary school, so I would have been nine or ten years old. The assignment was to be finished in one class. Regardless, I've always had a passion for writing, a knack with words, and a desire of being a writer that never quite worked out. It was probably my first instance of writer's block; I was at a loss for words and frantically scribbled meaningless words down on the page, over and over, until it dawned on me that I had just seen a new Goosebumps episode. I then recorded it in writing. As far as I could recall, the entire episode. Goddamn Goosebumps moment."	1cxkk57	i copied a goosebumps episode to win a competition	"

145	I severed the tip of my toddler brother’s finger in a door	"EDIT: I’m busy at work now but will try to reply to some comments later! I am beyond grateful for so many kind responses. I definitely cried to many of them. I had absolutely no clue this type of thing was so common and I’m honestly a bit angry that so much of my trauma could’ve been avoided:( But at least now I can begin to heal so thank you guys💜

Sigh. This won’t be short but I never talk about this memory because of how uncomfortable it makes me feel and how much shame I carry. 12 years ago, my parents had left me and my siblings with a new babysitter that evening and went out to a town about 30 minutes away. There was older brother (OB) age 14, older sister (OS) age 11, me age 9, younger brother (YB) age 7, and youngest brother age 2 who we’ll call Al. The babysitter was 17.
So, sometime that evening I was playing with Al in the upstairs area of the house. Babysitter was tutoring YB with violin in the room he and Al shared. What I remember is tickling Al and just having a blast horsing around together in my parents room. To mess with him, I got up and ran to YB’s room  and closed the door on him (like “haha you can’t catch me but i’m gonna open the door in 2 seconds”). He was right behind me and if I remember correctly had fallen on his butt outside the door. 
I’m getting sick to my stomach typing this but my little perfect baby brother Al, being 2, used the doorframe to pull himself up and as I closed the door, the tip of his pointer finger (right around the nail line) was caught in the door hinges. It’s really a blur, but he screamed and I immediately opened the door and I saw him holding up his tiny bloodied finger. It was pretty much hanging by a thread. The babysitter ran over and we all were freaking out. She called my parents and they immediately set on their way home as my dad was a doctor and planned to suture it back on. While we were waiting, everyone was huddling around Al trying to comfort him and also slow the bleeding. I was shunned to my room by who I can remember at least OB. All my siblings were very angry with me.
Luckily, my dad was able to completely repair the trauma to his finger and he is left with a little scar where it was sutured on. When my parents came home, I recall looks and feelings of disgust from them towards me. I felt so isolated in my whole family, like no matter how much I said it they couldn’t accept my apology or forgive me. My parents shamed me for what could’ve cost my brother part of his finger, and emphasized how it could’ve impacted his ability to play violin. 
For several years I was terrified of doors for other people. My siblings continued to run around slamming doors and I would cry and freak out and beg them to stop and say someone’s finger might get caught. I still get flashbacks to the event that really disturb me, but when I was younger it was much more intense.
I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts/behaviors a lot throughout my life, but I can distinctly remember that night being the very first time. Right after the incident when I wasn’t allowed to be near Al, I just kept thinking and saying “I wanna kill myself, I wanna die, I deserve to die”. I felt and to this day feel so terrible for my mistake. And so stupid.

146	I have stolen so much it’s honestly incredible, if I get caught now I’ll probably go away for life.	I have been shoplifting since I was maybe in my early teens. It all began with me and my friends at the time wanting to have to fun together so we decided to steal from one of the close corner shops near my house since I had invited them over. We had walked in, I had grabbed a drink and a pack of cigarettes from behind the counter while my mate distracted the clerk by asking him questions, we left after the clerk shouted at him to leave him alone. From then on it almost became like an addiction, anytime I would go to the shops I just had to take something. Nothing could stop me, not even my friends (who were there with me) could stop me from stealing. I became good, I mean really good, to the point where I could take anything from anywhere, clothes, food, jewellery, you name it and I could pinch it from the nearest shop that sold it. I didn’t permanently stop until my late thirties, and even then it was so hard to quit. I have matured now and I realise what I’ve done was wrong but, in the moment it felt so good to take something, the adrenaline that would course through my veins would be like a high. Anywho, do I need help? Is there something wrong with me? Suggestions? 	1cxfj9g	i have stolen so much its honestly incredible if i get caught now ill probably go away for life	i have been shoplifting since i was maybe in my early teens it all began with me and my friends at the time wanting to have to fun together so we decided to steal from one of the close corner shops near my house since i had invited them over we had walked in i had grabbed a drink and a pack of cigarettes from behind the counter while my mate distracted the clerk by asking him questions we left after the clerk shouted at him to leave him alone from then on it almost became like an addiction anytime i would go to the shops i just had to take something nothing could stop me not even my friends who were there with me could stop me from stealing i became good i mean really good to the point where i could take anything from anywhere clothes food jewellery you name it and i could pinch it from the nearest shop that sold it i didnt permanently stop until my late thirties and even then it was so hard to quit i have matured now and i realise what ive done was wrong but in the moment it felt so good to take something the adrenaline that would course through my veins would be like a high anywho do i need help is there something wrong with me suggestions 	cxfjg
147	I may or may not have bullied someone with heavy intellectual diagnoses as a kid.	"I've been living with the thought that i scarred someone for years and i just want to hear if others think it is as serious as i find it to be. It starts at an old school, maybe 8 years old or something like that. I get in a class (which, hint hint, ended up being probably the most mentally traumatic part of my life i've ever experienced) and i immediately met friends, targets and enemies. There was a group of foreigners, probably arabic of some sort, and they immediately started bullying me, because of my less severe ADHD and autism. They found it funny that i got angry easily. I was a shy little bitch so i didn't want to hurt anyone, but eventually they just bullied me to the point where i got pushed into being a mentally deranged psychopath willing to beat up anyone in my path. 

  
Usually, i'd take my anger out on a girl named Victoria. She was obviously a victim of some sort of intellectual based diagnose of more heavy harm than mine, and it was sort of just a perfect target. She couldn't have her own argument, she didn't even know which finger on her hand was the middle finger. Ofcourse i never actually hit her, since she moved from the school in 2nd grade, probably on behalf of her parents. I'm sort of happy that she did, because that was around when i started hitting anyone in my path.

  
Before i started getting violent with others, i usually just pushed them down slides they were too scared of. Basically psychological warfare. 

  
The really bad thing about this is that i ran on pills, like Elvanse, Ritalin and others. This hit me hard as a kid. When i was 6 i lost so much weight that i weighed about 10-15 kilos. It hit me physically and mentally. I would either get angrier, or calmer. If i got angrier, i ate more, if i got calmer, i ate nothing. We ended up ditching the pills when i turned 11, since i grew up and could do things properly. I also didn't get diagnosed with autism until i was 9, so i was given completely incorrect treatments, hitting me even more. 

  
I ofcourse took several of these things to principals, and teachers, but as said, that school had really NO precautions. Teachers had full right to just not give a fuck, which is exactly what they did 90% of the time. 

  
Ask me whatever, tell me whatever. I probably wont answer alot since i'm not reddit much, but i just want to know if it's as bad as it really is."	1cx6g4b	i may or may not have bullied someone with heavy intellectual diagnoses as a kid	"ive been living with the thought that i scarred someone for years and i just want to hear if others think it is as serious as i find it to be it starts at an old school maybe  years old or something like that i get in a class which hint hint ended up being probably the most mentally traumatic part of my life ive ever experienced and i immediately met friends targets and enemies there was a group of foreigners probably arabic of some sort and they immediately started bullying me because of my less severe adhd and autism they found it funny that i got angry easily i was a shy little bitch so i didnt want to hurt anyone but eventually they just bullied me to the point where i got pushed into being a mentally deranged psychopath willing to beat up anyone in my path

149	The time I got suspended and got away with it by saying the craziest excuse ever at my school.	Ok, this is weird taken out of context, but basically it was my second term of being in a Catholic school, and a new library was being made (requested by the principle). It was there, all big and massive, the books were all stored on a shelf and stuff. The reason I called it the whitest school ever was because I'm Asian, and I had never been to a library stacked with white people before. Sure, there was some mixed race there, but a majority of them were white, especially with their blond hair. But anyway, during that time, I felt like I needed to go to the toilet badly, SO BAD in fact that I felt like I had a bladder infection. So I went to one of the new toilet stall that was being made, look down on the ground and walked into one of the toilet there were two bathroom stalls and I went to one of them, pulled my pants down and started pissing on the bowl so aggressive that I swore I heard a girl's giggle and that was when I thought... I was in the wrong bathroom, so I pulled my underwear and pants up, I felt a fucking sense of embarrassment flew right through me when I ran out of the bathroom and found this one girl who was lesbian in my English class screamed after I ran out and pass her, two days later my principle was talking with me and I got suspended for four days. Four days later, my mum and I were sitting in front of the principle's assistant (Basically she's just your average stereotypical fat American woman) staring at me, and we begin to talk and here's the part of the story I was so grateful for.... After they finish talking she looked at me and told me why did you piss everywhere in the toilet bowl, so I said to her, I had a foreskin surgery, hence why I couldn't control my penis, so I pissed everywhere on the floor as an excuse and that was last year, and I'm still at the school.	1cwbj5l	the time i got suspended and got away with it by saying the craziest excuse ever at my school	ok this is weird taken out of context but basically it was my second term of being in a catholic school and a new library was being made requested by the principle it was there all big and massive the books were all stored on a shelf and stuff the reason i called it the whitest school ever was because im asian and i had never been to a library stacked with white people before sure there was some mixed race there but a majority of them were white especially with their blond hair but anyway during that time i felt like i needed to go to the toilet badly so bad in fact that i felt like i had a bladder infection so i went to one of the new toilet stall that was being made look down on the ground and walked into one of the toilet there were two bathroom stalls and i went to one of them pulled my pants down and started pissing on the bowl so aggressive that i swore i heard a girls giggle and that was when i thought i was in the wrong bathroom so i pulled my underwear and pants up i felt a fucking sense of embarrassment flew right through me when i ran out of the bathroom and found this one girl who was lesbian in my english class screamed after i ran out and pass her two days later my principle was talking with me and i got suspended for four days four days later my mum and i were sitting in front of the principles assistant basically shes just your average stereotypical fat american woman staring at me and we begin to talk and heres the part of the story i was so grateful for after they finish talking she looked at me and told me why did you piss everywhere in the toilet bowl so i said to her i had a foreskin surgery hence why i couldnt control my penis so i pissed everywhere on the floor as an excuse and that was last year and im still at the school	cwbjl
150	I was a robber as a kid and regret it with all my heart	"You heard that right,12 year old me had more money than he could comprehend.

I started my robbing streak by finding out the family safe and it's combination,both my parent's Debit cards and exactly where they hide their cash. I also had just brought a second hand PS4 with the original owner's debit card in it.

The peak of the robbing was when I had 55,000 Vbucks 11,000 gems in the game called Brawl stars, thousands of robux. I was also hosting tournaments in these games between my classmates with winners getting an ingame or real life price in the form of currency.

On the non-digital side i have stolen well over 1000 in US dollars from my dad and more than 2000 US dollars from my mom. 

It all ended when aI was 13 my parents found out about most of my robberies and threatened to leave me at the adoption center where thy got me from (god damn do I feel bad still) I feel every bad feeling that I could feel and it isn't like I didn't knew I was spending IRL money in a game,I knew that very well.

151	I didn't give him the job because his kid is a jerk	"I work in Sr Management at a pretty significant company, we recent started posting for some Manager level positions. 

My kids both play hockey, and over the winter we played alot of games before this one kids rep team. The kid is a jerk, he plays his music loud in common areas, he shoots the ball around in the hallways away from the rink and has hit a few kids, he goes to stick and puck and steals the pucks from kids just learning how to play. Like I said an overall jerk!

Evey time I see his dad just sitting around chatting with his friends, ignoring his kids actions.

So, imagine my suprise when I see the dad in front of me for an interview (I have never actually spoken to him or know his name, he obviously had no idea who I was). As the interview went on all I could think about was how his kid must have learned that jerky behaviors from somewhere and what can I expect from someone who let's his kid act this way.

He interviewed very well, in fact I thought he was the best, but decided to pass on him just because of his jerky kid, im sure he has no idea, im curious if he says hi to me at the rink?"	1cw2fx7	i didnt give him the job because his kid is a jerk	"i work in sr management at a pretty significant company we recent started posting for some manager level positions

so imagine my suprise when i see the dad in front of me for an interview i have never actually spoken to him or know his name he obviously had no idea who i was as the interview went on all i could think about was how his kid must have learned that jerky behaviors from somewhere and what can i expect from someone who lets his kid act this way

he interviewed very well in fact i thought he was the best but decided to pass on him just because of his jerky kid im sure he has no idea im curious if he says hi to me at the rink"	cwfx
152	I Stole alcohol from my uncle. I left his back door unlocked	I stole a bottle of liquor from my uncle when I was in high school!

153	My self destructive behavior came back to me with a vengeance	"So It's been almost a year since I moved cities in order to go to college. I was excited af cuz my parents have been overprotective all my life and I wanted some freedom. What I got instead was a feeling of alienation and loneliness, I have always had a lot of anxiety growing up, mostly with socials situations because I wasn't allowed to go out alone in my childhood (the first time I went to a friend's birthday without my parents or a guardian was in 11th grade, yes I'm not kidding). I felt depressed and very lonely, I didn't feel like going to the college because the crowd is unironically just a bunch of bigots and I can't stand them. I started to become an alcoholic and a smoker. Since I was not going to my college, I didn't submit any of my assignments and that pretty much fucked up my internals for the first year and now I have to score a lot in my exams in order to just pass in a particular subject. Yesterday, my dad calls me and says, ""I know everything, don't think that I don't cuz I know everything"" In front of my mother tooandt then well.. They do know everything, for the last 24 hours, stuff has gotten sad man like they are insanely disappointed and I don't blame them. I tried explaining some of my issues and how sad I've been but well... They think these are just excuses and start comparing me to other kids and what not.

This is not me trying to justify my behavior, I do want to get better. My parents have my college portal ID now and they have said that they will check it everyday from next sem and that if something like this happens again, they will put me in a rehab center and I can say good bye to college.

154	I drove on mushrooms and put my friends lives in danger	"This happened a month or so ago, i havent told anyone in my personal life because im so ashamed for my actions but i really need to get this off my chest. 

For her birthday, my friend wanted to take a hiking trip with our group of friends and the site was a 45 minute drive away. We had to split our group into two cars and mine was one we took. We all planned on doing mushrooms and enjoying nature, but i wanted mine to kick in by the time we got there so i took my dose right before we left. The timing was completely off, and they kicked in after around 20min while i was in the middle of driving on a long stretch of highway which was one lane in each direction. 

Everything was fine, we were joking and chatting but i felt like i shouldn’t be driving, however the other people in the car were also on shrooms so i decided to suck it up. At one point we got behind a car that was significantly slower than what we were going before, and my friend told me “Just go around them!” And without a second thought i did, not noticing the other car driving straight at us in the opposing lane. 

I’m shaking as i type this, but we were stuck between both cars unable to merge. If that car didn’t swerve off the road we would have crashed head on at 70mph and it would have been completely my fault. I felt so incredibly guilty and stupid, for being on shrooms and driving, for putting my friends’ lives in danger. They got over it quickly and went back to chatting, probably because by the grace of God we survived, but i was silent the rest of the drive fighting a panic attack.

We opted not to tell the rest of the group, as we didn’t want them to worry and one was already apprehensive about us driving. I havent told anyone else and we haven’t talked about it since, but i can’t shake the fear i had and my regret. I’m never doing something this stupid again i think about it every day"	1cukl0e	i drove on mushrooms and put my friends lives in danger	"this happened a month or so ago i havent told anyone in my personal life because im so ashamed for my actions but i really need to get this off my chest

155	I’ve been a compulsive liar for my whole life and don’t really know how to stop.	I lie about things that don’t really matter for literally no reason and don’t know how to stop. Obviously, this is something I should talk to my therapist about but its something I’ve been struggling with and am having a hard time admitting that I do it. I don’t know why. I never lie about things that actually matter because I have no reason to. I tend to lie about stuff to make myself look interesting or to appear more fun than I am to people. I’ve become more comfortable with who I actually am within the past few years and instead of admitting my lies I’ve just started doing what I lied about. An example would be telling someone I play a lot of souls games (why?) even though I don’t own any so recently I just started playing. I’ve never had a valid reason to lie or learn to lie as well as I do. Why do I lie about this stuff and is doing what I lied about after the fact enough reconciliation?	1cukg9w	ive been a compulsive liar for my whole life and dont really know how to stop	i lie about things that dont really matter for literally no reason and dont know how to stop obviously this is something i should talk to my therapist about but its something ive been struggling with and am having a hard time admitting that i do it i dont know why i never lie about things that actually matter because i have no reason to i tend to lie about stuff to make myself look interesting or to appear more fun than i am to people ive become more comfortable with who i actually am within the past few years and instead of admitting my lies ive just started doing what i lied about an example would be telling someone i play a lot of souls games why even though i dont own any so recently i just started playing ive never had a valid reason to lie or learn to lie as well as i do why do i lie about this stuff and is doing what i lied about after the fact enough reconciliation	cukgw
156	I stole promotional scratchcards from burger king & ate burgers every meal for months. 	"This was a long time ago, I was a skater in my 20's & the manager at Burger King had so much attitude I felt he deserved it.

They ran a promotional scratchcard, a grid of 9 squares. 
Scratch off any single row, if it contains 3 matching symbols you won that item. 

The options were fries, drink or whopper. 

So having worked out that the odds were ridiculously slim it annoyed me so off I went to burger king. 

It was always minimally staffed so as soon as the server turned her back I grabbed a huge stack of cards (they were free after all). 

Every time I went, every time the server turned her back, I grabbed more, always keeping the stack in order. 

Now I'd worked out that the way to win was fully scratch a card off to establish which line was the winner, then scratch off that corresponding line on the next until it stopped winning. 

Then completely scratch that one off, rinse & repeat. 


This meant only about one in thirty didn't win rather than the ridiculously long odds bk intended. 

The second best part of all this was the manager quizzing me then getting visibly annoyed at my ""I've always been lucky"" explanation but being unable to explain the impossible probabilities of being that lucky. 


But by far my favourite part was getting a burger off the manager, getting my scratchcard, sitting down & appearing to scratch it off, (but swapping it for a pre scratched one), then shouting ""Yes! Free whopper"" 

He literally ran over & inspected my card every which way. 

Poor man. 


I wasn't keen on coke or fries so gave them all away to the younger skaters who then absolutely pillaged the place. 


I'd have loved to have been a fly on the wall for the ""How much extra money did you make off the promo"" area meeting. 

I'm betting over 90% of the winners of their promo were just me.

157	I shoplifted from Blockbuster  and never got caught	"When I was about 8, my dad took my brothers and I to Blockbuster to rent some movies, as was our weekly routine. I really wanted to get Milk Duds but my dad wouldn’t let me. While waiting in line to check out, I stood in front of the candy kiosk and discretely opened up a box of milk duds, slipping a single Dud out of the box and into my mouth. I’m pretty sure I didn’t chew or swallow it until we were safely out of the store.

I was so terrified I was going to get in trouble for this for months and probably years after the incident, certain that there must have been a security camera that captured my actions. I was convinced that after someone reviewed that security footage they would come knocking on my door to punish me for my horrible crime. Every time we went back to Blockbuster I was walking on egg shells, trying to put on a performance as the most polite and law-abiding citizen child, not wanting to tip anyone off to what I had been capable of. 

I was unsurprisingly never caught for the incident, but felt a twang of guilt for years after every time I set foot in a Blockbuster.

159	I lied about my SAT scores to everyone that I know	"I have had a really terrible week but I'm not on r/venting so I'm not gonna go into it. Last night I seriously considered committing. But today my SAT scores came out. And I got a 940. A kind of bad score if I want to go to college. And everyone was sharing thier scores, so I was gonna joke with them. I have always been considered a dumbass. I am in geometry as a junior. (There is freshman above me in math level) and I am failing all my classes. So I was like ""nobody is going to believe that I got a high score"" so I just inspect elemented my score to say 1580. 800 in emglish and 780 in math. For those who don't know, 1600 is the max you can get. And nobody at my school has ever gotten above 1540 I don't think. So I posted it in my gc, then everyone started complementing me congratulating me for such a good job and how proud they are of me. I posted it on my story, people I have never talked to told me how amazing that was. I feel so loved. Yesterday I was going to try and kill myself. I had no friends. Nobody cared. I was just the dumbass who couldn't do anything right. But now people are proud of me! I don't think I've ever heard that before from my friends. I don't think in going to tell the truth.

When I ran off, I started walking with these two couples as if they were my parents. These two couple turned into her aisle and I kept walking straight.

She said ""okay, he just threw a ball at me! HEY YOU, SHOW ME WHERE YOUR PARENTS ARE AT YOU JUST THREW A BALL AT ME!"" I said ""no I didn't!"" She said ""YES YOU DID SHOW ME WHERE THEY AT! I DO NOT DEAL WITH LITTLE KIDS!""

Then I led her to my mom. As we walked through the aisle literally everyone there was silent and looking at us. When we were walking I apologized but she didn't respond. When I found mom, the woman said to her ""is this your son?"" She said ""yes!"" She goes ""your son threw a ball at me and then he ran off and he thought that I didn't see him!

I cringe every time i think about it.. I had this idea that if he saw the picture, he might take an interest in me outside of work. But because i was too afraid to approach him directly i pretended i tried to send it to a fwb, and sent to him instead (same name).

He never said anything about it but i did feel he looked at me differently after. Am i a bad person??

My younger siblings seen me sneak out so many times. But we all had each other’s backs. So I wasn’t worried about them snitching on me. 

As they got into high school and having gf/bf. They started doing what I was doing. Texting me to unlock the doors for them. So I pretty much started the trend for my siblings to sneak out or sneak their gf/bf in.

I have a weird relationship with food, and I have a hard time understanding boundaries sometimes because I have none of my own. I have a habit of stealing my roommates, food, and also other peoples pencils for some reason. 
I would go  home for the weekend and I would eat it and then replace it before she came back.  I justified it because i always give other people food and I don’t really care if they take mine either.  However I started to feel extremely guilty for doing this, but I also get scared to ask people for things so I would just replace it in hopes she wouldn’t find out.  I ended up taking two pieces of sour patch kids after she told me not too, but then I told her and I apologized profusely.  Seeing how upset it made her honestly made me feel terrible and so I have never done it again, but yeah.  It’s like I felt entitled to it because I wouldn’t care and because I always replace it.  I know that’s wrong.  

I would tell myself “it’s just food. You wouldn’t care if someone took yours, it’s not a big deal.” But it IS  a big deal, it’s a huge disrespect to people, and I have stopped doing this. 

Also when I was working at the high school I substitute at I took a mechanical pencil off the teachers  desk because it was really cool and I kept it for myself.  Here is a list of all the things I’ve taken this year 

1.) a mechanical pencil
2.) Cinnamon Toast Crunch 
3.) sour patch kids 
4.) tampons

170	I Used to frequent adult websites to verbally abuse people	"So, I was 13-14 and hanging with the wrong crowd. I Would get drunk every so often. My brother (9 years my senior) gave me the PW to this ""myfreepaysite"" where live models perform for money. I Would proceed to sit there with a 40oz OE 800. I Would proceed to get drunk and talk trash to these women. Things like, ""When you sit like that, you look like you are trying to mount a horse"" or ""Your upper lip was stung by bees and your bottom lip looks scared""... Anyhow, I hope those ladies are doing better now. I was a bit of a butthead.

171	Manipulated my physics teacher into giving me a better grade. 	"This was during my school days. I was the class prefect. It was the time for our Physics class and our teacher was late. As a standard procedure I went to the department to remind him. When I entered his chamber, I found out he was checking our answer scripts from the term final. 

This teacher was comparatively new in our school and heavily dependent on the class leaders in many aspects. I did not had a good exam. Hence, I waited until he started examining my answer sheet. I pretended this was the answer sheet of one of the most talented boys in the class. Manipulated him into giving at least 10 more marks.

172	i got suspended from university and haven’t told my parents yet.	"So I graduated in 2023 from a majority white area in upper-middle-class suburbia GA. Everyone around here acts super high class and is tight strung and rich and stuck up. I’m mixed and adopted so I know that I’m spoiled and that I have way more than I deserve. I graduated with honors from high school and began attending a little women’s college on a half academic, half athletic scholarship. I studied nursing and psychology (a double major) 

First semester starts and I’m doing great. Around midterms is when everything went downhill. Because it was the beginning of basketball season, I was struggling to juggle both school and grades, and I was out partying a lot more than I should’ve been (though granted, i’m in COLLEGE, but i was kinda sheltered at home and took advantage of the freedom). I ended up tanking most of my midterms and not being able to play basketball for the rest of the semester. I failed 2 classes and was put on ‘academic probation’ by the school. It doesn’t go on your record or anything, it’s just so the school can kick you out before you mess up their stats. Second semester goes by in a flash and I’m doing decently, but I end up having to drop a class and take another online. My grandpa died unexpectedly right before midterms and I tanked my only 2. I go into a depression deeper than I have in a minute and fail both my classes. 

The school year ended and now i’m home, and the other day I got an email explaining my probationary period has ended and because I failed to keep my GPA above a 3.0 I’ve lost my scholarship and have been put on academic suspension. I appealed to it by sending an email and explaining my situation and failure to pass my classes, but i won’t get an answer back til the end of the month. 

I hated that school anyways and want to go to a technical school to be an EMT, but i did enjoy my time there and will miss my friends. 

my family can pay for me to go to a technical or community college so i can get my prerequisite classes done, but my sister is graduating in may and is attending my college in the fall. my mom thinks we’ll be going there together. 

i don’t know how to tell them how ive failed. i wish i could go back and tell myself, “hey. just get up for class. this ONE TIME.” or forced myself to study harder. i know i did the best i could at the time, but it still is a horrible feeling to see myself turn into this after i’ve done better in the past. 

TL;DR : i failed majority of my classes and lost a ton of scholarship money by getting suspended for bad grades.

 my mom thinks i’m going back next semester with my sister and i haven’t told her yet that i’ve disappointed her.

173	when i was high school, i took pictures of a test and got caught	When I was in high school, I was pretty popular you could say. I was a cheerleader and blonde and an identical twin, also was pretty friendly with every one in our school. My sophomore year, my chemistry teacher left the classroom for a bit and left our copies of our upcoming test on his desk. I snuck up to his desk in front of everyone and took pictures of the test, front/back everything. I’ve always been good at school and never even really needed it. I guess I was trying to be cool and I was 16. Everyone was awing and ooohing and laughing, whole thing took about a minute. a couple minutes later, my teacher comes back into the classroom and immediately calls me out to the hallway. He asks me if i took pictures of the test while he was gone. I’m in shock, face turns bright red. How could he possibly know that? he was gone and he hadn’t talked to anyone. I straight up lied and told him no despite him asking me to tell him the truth. He said okay and I went back to my desk. I was so embarrassed and nothing ever happened of it. To this day, I have 0 idea how he could have possibly known that, I confronted everyone in my class and never learned anything. Thinking he had a spy, a secret camera, or it was a test and i was set up. Almost a decade later and I still think about it. 	1ct1ixb	when i was high school i took pictures of a test and got caught	when i was in high school i was pretty popular you could say i was a cheerleader and blonde and an identical twin also was pretty friendly with every one in our school my sophomore year my chemistry teacher left the classroom for a bit and left our copies of our upcoming test on his desk i snuck up to his desk in front of everyone and took pictures of the test frontback everything ive always been good at school and never even really needed it i guess i was trying to be cool and i was  everyone was awing and ooohing and laughing whole thing took about a minute a couple minutes later my teacher comes back into the classroom and immediately calls me out to the hallway he asks me if i took pictures of the test while he was gone im in shock face turns bright red how could he possibly know that he was gone and he hadnt talked to anyone i straight up lied and told him no despite him asking me to tell him the truth he said okay and i went back to my desk i was so embarrassed and nothing ever happened of it to this day i have  idea how he could have possibly known that i confronted everyone in my class and never learned anything thinking he had a spy a secret camera or it was a test and i was set up almost a decade later and i still think about it 	ctixb
174	I drew something nsfw at work and left it in the bathroom	"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. Basically today at my job as a security guard I drew something. Usually at work I get bored and start doodling. Well today I got super bored and began drawing an nsfw comic. Yeah I know this was extremely dumb to be doing at work but bear with me. I don't want to be too specific on where I work but basically there are points in the day where I walk around the building. So I go to one of the bathrooms and continue drawing this obscene comic.

I'm a few panels in, there isn't any actual sex just a dude with a big pp talking to a girl. Usual nsfw scenario, know what I mean? Then, I put it on the toilet so I can pull my pants up and then I must've forgotten it there. I don't usually do this I usually pick it back up and put it in my pocket. Tbh I'm not entirely sure where I left it. Hopefully it was the bathroom because there are a bunch of cameras in this place. So yeah I left this comic in the bathroom and like 10 minutes later in a place that's off camera I pull out the drawing, but it isn't that drawing it's a different one.

So naturally I begin panicking and I go back to that bathroom but somebody is in the stall so I just pretend to use the bathroom and leave. I check another bathroom where I might've left it about an hour later and it isn't there either. I was only at work for another hour after I left the paper in the bathroom and I didn't hear anything about it.

This means somebody found it. Now depending on who this individual is they might either A. say wtf and throw it away, or B. say wtf and hand it into security or HR. Depending on the decision my job could be at stake. Cause all they have to do is check the cameras and see who went to the bathroom before the person who found it. Hopefully I can lie my way out of this if I'm questioned but if not I get what I deserve and probably won't be able to get a job anywhere else ever again. Moral of the story don't draw bullshit at work, and if you do, keep track of it.

With that said, how fucked am I reddit?

TL:DR: I drew something nsfw at work and left it in the bathroom/other location.

Update: Well, I didn't hear anything about it today at work. I went the whole day paranoid af lmao. But nothing came of it, so whoever found that silly comic threw it away or took it home or just didn't care. Thank you for all the comments everyone! I think my anxiety was just making me assume the worst.

175	I once gaslit my mother into letting me stay up late at night	"Ok this is story's probably a lot more light-hearted than some of the stuff I've seen on this subreddit but I'm bored and this just popped back into my head so here goes.

When I was like 12ish I was developing a habit of staying up all night and sleeping during the day during school breaks, which as you may imagine, my mother wasn't happy about. 

Being the pre teen little shit I was, I argued that no harm was done since I always turned my sleep schedule back around when school started up again and I was still getting sleep just at different times. Looking back my mother was probably more concerned about me being a shut in who touched less grass than a camel and the eye strain from playing video games and watching YouTube in the dark every day but I digress.

Anyway one day I guess she decided to try a more hands one approach to parenting for a change a told me she'd be shutting off the internet at 10pm that night. 

Naturally I was bummed at this, but as I've said, what I also was, was a little shit. So I came up with a brilliant scheme to foil my mother's nefarious plan of getting her preteen child to have a healthy life style.

Basically what I did was I went on youtube and let a video play until the end (not relevent but this was the video https://youtu.be/cMkJDPvJxdk?si=lOfs0pIH7urOnb6J , yes it was Vocaloid, shocker I know) so the video was fully loaded in.

Then, 10pm rolled around and mom did as she said and disabled the WiFi router, leaving me, a poor Gen z child starved of it's one source of entertainment. But I didn't care that much actually since I was too busy smirking and (metaphorically) rubbing my palms together like a cartoon supervillain at my genius scheme.

Long story short I spent like 9 hours listening to that one Vocaloid song on loop while sketching in my art book until finally, I heard my mother wake up from the other room.

The look of complete befuddlement on her face when she saw me watching a YouTube video like nothing happened was pretty fun I'll admit, but I was determined to keep a straight face as she asked me how I was doing that.

Putting on my best sheepishly confused expression I shrugged and said something like ""I dunno, you must have pressed the wrong button or something""

Now obviously this whole plan hinged on my mother not understanding technology to save her life, and lo and behold, it worked. And I guess my mother must have just gave up after that one plan cause she just let me be after that.

Anyway, moral of the story, don't gaslight your parents kids, and maybe go touch some grass"	1csuouf	i once gaslit my mother into letting me stay up late at night	"ok this is storys probably a lot more lighthearted than some of the stuff ive seen on this subreddit but im bored and this just popped back into my head so here goes

176	I get drunk to deal with my job and I know it is not the best idea	"Yes. I know it is not a good idea, but you have to understand how much I despise meetings.

My work is very stressful and I work weird hours. Every day brings new problems and I am expected to be able to solve them all. Do not misunderstand. I am also grateful that I can work. But I hate... and I mean HATE calls and meetings. Social interaction drains me and I do not have a normal person's social battery. I have arrived at a place of pure desperation.

Getting drunk seems to be the only way to deal with this. Maybe ""drunk"" is an exaggeration... buzzed? The calls are usually over zoom. And the meetings always take place during the night. I just feel like sharing and venting and full transparency... I am kinda wasted right now. Anyone relate? Thoughts? The only way I seem to be able to handle things is by getting a bit buzzed. Should I just accept this and go on? I'm confused.

177	I selfishly started to take performance enhancers.  	"I (m20) started taking peds almost a year prior and I feel like dirt. Not in a sense of testosterone suppression but like guilt. I know this might sound bad and I’m young and this but I’m very educated on the subject of bodybuilding and peds. I want to bodybuild it’s just very intriguing. I’ve been lifting and managing nutrition for 4-5 years and I made an irrational thought and hopped on some things I shouldn’t have and it’s biting me in the ass. My family has noticed, I didn’t think it was drastic bc I look in the mirror and weigh myself everyday but pictures from 4 months ago are crazy different and my family has obviously picked up on it, not only that but they mentioned mood swings. They sat me down and took me to get blood work and treatment it’s just been a super awkward relationship since. I look and felt on top of the world but idk how to put their disappointment into words. Ik I fucked up but I do want to be a bodybuilder in the future. I was never social and lifting and seeing mental confidence improve and physical progress got me wanting more. I’m not sure doing this was worth the ordeal it became and I feel like shit for causing this distress.

179	i attempted to off myself last year and i have told no-one	"edit: thank you guys so much for your kind comments. right now i am in a much better place than i was back then. that attempt was the first and only one i've done, and it was the most physical and mental pain i've ever experienced, so i thought that if offing myself causes me that much pain then it wasn't worth attempting again, sorry if that sounded stupid. although i'm still going through some struggles, i am content with my life and i have lots of things to look forward to and enjoy. thanks again.



i've told no-one about it, not my family or friends. at the time my relationship with my parents was bad and we were arguing more than ever. i was extremely insecure with my body and face, i hated the way i looked. i lost interest in things i've been doing since i was a kid. everything was just overwhelming.

i attempted by overdosing on painkillers at 1am on a school day. i remember my whole body shaking as i swallowed each pill.

when i woke up the next day i got ready for school as usual. on the bus i got extremely nauseous and had to get off to call my mum to pick me up. i threw up instantly when i was driven back home. she tried to brush it off and send me to school anyway but on the way i felt like vomiting again so she drove me back home, then i threw up again in the bathroom.

i was bedridden for the whole day and i couldn't eat anything or else it would come back up. i couldn't even walk without feeling dizzy or close to collapsing.

i just said to my parents i was 'sick' because of food poisoning from the other day. i don't know if they believed me"	1crqrrt	i attempted to off myself last year and i have told noone	"edit thank you guys so much for your kind comments right now i am in a much better place than i was back then that attempt was the first and only one ive done and it was the most physical and mental pain ive ever experienced so i thought that if offing myself causes me that much pain then it wasnt worth attempting again sorry if that sounded stupid although im still going through some struggles i am content with my life and i have lots of things to look forward to and enjoy thanks again

I’m almost 30 now. Grew up in different parts. Anyways, I walked out with $700 and an iPod. I gave the iPod to one of my sisters Mormon friend. He knew how I got it.

So then I quickly turn it off and go home instantly and thought about going to a 3rd party tech shop and then the next day I go to the shop in a different city and then ask them if I can see a used Apple Watch Ultra so then they handed it to me and my adrenaline was going through the roof, so then since there was people blocking the way I instantly searched for cameras and there was only one camera but something was blocking it, and then I instantly switched the Watch I had in my pocket for the one without iCloud lock and then I told him it's fine I don't want it anymore so then the second guy sees it and finds a something weird on the screen and then he feels it and it was a protector and then he tells me ""why is there a screen protector on the watch when there wasn't one on the one I gave you"" and then I told him ""I don't know, that was the one you gave me"" so then he turns it on and comes across a iCloud lock and he tells me it has a iCloud lock and then I was scared as shit, and then while he was checking it I slid the new one behind my socks just incase they search my pockets and then I stay in the store and not leave so I don't act more suspicious then I was, so then it got to the point where I told them and even a customer to pat my pockets so then they did and didn't find anything. So I stay in the store a little but then ask if I can leave and they said I'm good to go...  After 2 months I still have it.. only thing that I only felt and still feel is guilt and regret I plan on returning it back, I need to change the way my life it before it just gets worse... I know the person saved a lot of money and worked hard in order to buy that watch and my plan is to return the watch back to the store, get the old one back and return it back to the gym so the owner and reclaim it, enough to say I'm a piece of shit for doing it"	1cqmvof	i stole a apple watch ultra and switched it to a brand new one from stealing it from someones locker in my gym	so this one day i go to my gym and while i find a locker i opened a locker that was in use and then i came across a bookbag and came across a apple watch ultra so then i take it then lock myself in the bathroom to see if it had a password then turns out that it didnt so i got happy so then i quickly factory reset it and then turns out it had a icloud lock so then i quickly turn it off and go home instantly and thought about going to a rd party tech shop and then the next day i go to the shop in a different city and then ask them if i can see a used apple watch ultra so then they handed it to me and my adrenaline was going through the roof so then since there was people blocking the way i instantly searched for cameras and there was only one camera but something was blocking it and then i instantly switched the watch i had in my pocket for the one without icloud lock and then i told him its fine i dont want it anymore so then the second guy sees it and finds a something weird on the screen and then he feels it and it was a protector and then he tells me why is there a screen protector on the watch when there wasnt one on the one i gave you and then i told him i dont know that was the one you gave me so then he turns it on and comes across a icloud lock and he tells me it has a icloud lock and then i was scared as shit and then while he was checking it i slid the new one behind my socks just incase they search my pockets and then i stay in the store and not leave so i dont act more suspicious then i was so then it got to the point where i told them and even a customer to pat my pockets so then they did and didnt find anything so i stay in the store a little but then ask if i can leave and they said im good to go  after  months i still have it only thing that i only felt and still feel is guilt and regret i plan on returning it back i need to change the way my life it before it just gets worse i know the person saved a lot of money and worked hard in order to buy that watch and my plan is to return the watch back to the store get the old one back and return it back to the gym so the owner and reclaim it enough to say im a piece of shit for doing it	cqmvof
182	I found someone’s lipstick in a nice hotel lobby and decided to color all over a wooden side table with it.	I was drunk and well into my 20’s.

183	I shoplifted some textbooks for school because I can't afford them and now I'm scared every single day	It's been about a week and a half since but a few courses I'm taking at uni requires me to purchase some expensive textbooks (around $400). I really don't have the money but need these books and I can't get them for free online either.

184	I (19F) used to vandalize the bathrooms at school in 4th grade	"So, when I was a kid, I will admit that I was a destructive little brat. I'd do this thing in the school bathroom where I'd roll up a ball of toilet paper, dip it into the toilet so half of it was wet, then launch the water-logged, soggy lump of toilet paper at the ceiling. 

Every time, it would stick to the ceiling and just stay there. Nobody ever caught me, and this only went on for about a week until my 10-year-old brain got bored of it, but damn, I actually feel really bad for the janitors who had to scrape them off the ceiling. The first time it happened, the toilet paper went unnoticed for a day or two, so they had to be well-dried and practically super-glued to the ceiling. (The toilet water was unused btw. Feel like people might have questions about that)

I hope the janitors didn't have a hard time trying to get that off the ceiling. They were underpaid enough as it was."	1cpct5r	i f used to vandalize the bathrooms at school in th grade	"so when i was a kid i will admit that i was a destructive little brat id do this thing in the school bathroom where id roll up a ball of toilet paper dip it into the toilet so half of it was wet then launch the waterlogged soggy lump of toilet paper at the ceiling

185	I (18M) stole money from my uncle, and used it to sell old food at school.	"Back when I was 15, I ended up staying with my grandparents, my uncle, and my cousin (all in one house) since they lived closer to my school, that way my mom wouldn't spend money on gas. There was a donut shop on the walk to school, and I had no way of making money.

One day, I was bringing in the mail after school and had to put my uncle's mail in his room while he was gone. I put a single letter on his bedside table and noticed a $20 sticking out of the drawer. I had an idea, and grabbed it.

The next day I walked over to that donut shop, and found out they sold 1-day-old donuts in a set of 12 for $10. I bought the box, and got a fresh one for myself.

I went to school and intended to give the donuts so my friends when they showed up, but someone asked if they had one. When i said no, she offered to buy one from me. That made me realize people were willing to buy donuts before school, and so I agreed to sell it to her.

For the next two years I walked around school every morning, selling a dozen donuts every day and making a small profit without telling everyone they were day old ones. After a while, I ended up buying two boxes a day and selling those all before school.

  
I eventually earned enough to put $20 back in my uncle's room and he never suspected i was the one that took it. I feel bad for stealing from my uncle as he passed away a few months after i slipped the money back into his room, but I got a few switch games and a used gameboy advance online from the other money I had."	1cp4hqw	i m stole money from my uncle and used it to sell old food at school	"back when i was  i ended up staying with my grandparents my uncle and my cousin all in one house since they lived closer to my school that way my mom wouldnt spend money on gas there was a donut shop on the walk to school and i had no way of making money

186	I [27M] gropped my [29F] friend while she was asleep	"I don't know how to start this

First of all, sorry if my english is not perfect, it is not my native language.

I feel so ashamed and guilty about what I did.

A week ago, I invited my friend over, I have feelings for her but was too anxious and socially ankward to tell her.

During the afternoon, we started cuddling each over and she asked me to massage her, which I did, then we started falling asleep while cuddling each over. I woke up before her and I don't know what I was thinking but I started touching her breasts under her t-shirt, she didn't object and I thought by now she was awake, so I continued to touch her. I thought that because of her agreeing me to massage her, she was sending me signals that she was interested in me.

Then I realized she was still sleeping and panicked about what I did, stopped and pretended nothing happened.

When she finally woke up, she didn't say anything about what happened but I could sense something was off.

I hesitated about telling her but I was afraid this would ruin our relationship.

Fastforward to today, she sent me a message about wanting to talk to me about something. We phoned each other and she told me she was awake, knew what I have done and because she was surprised, froze up during the moment.

At that moment, I felt the biggest shame and guilt I have ever felt. I've always valued doing the right things in life, sometimes preaching about it for example, when talking about celebrities doing awfull things similar to what I did. I feel like an hypocrite.

I started immediately apologizing, saying I feel so bad about what I have done, saying I'm sorry about breaking the trust she put in me as a friend.

She said that she usually like to cuddle and thought our relationship was platonic. At the end, she said she forgave me, that I shouldn't feel bad about it, never do this kind of things again and still want to be my friend despite all that.

I don't deserve a friend like her and I don't deserve her forgiveness.

I don't know what to think about myself. This has been 8 years since I've had a girlfriend and fucked up so bad. I feel like a creep who abused a woman during a vulnerable moment."	1coy4et	i m gropped my f friend while she was asleep	"i dont know how to start this

187	I blamed my sister for a scar that I caused myself	"If you look at the back of my head, you'll see a sizable scar running across my scalp. Ask my parents on how this came to be, and they'll tell you my older sister pushed me in the garages, and I hit my head on the concrete. But that is but a ruse, a lie concocted to save my 7~8 years old self from being seen as an idiot.
We live in an apartment building with underground garages, so the individual garages were pretty thin. What that meant is that we kids would get in and out of the car while it was still outside, and we would wait there while my parents ferried things in and out of the trunk. We would wait there. Unsupervised.
So one day my kid brain wondered what it would be like to fall backwards on the hard concrete floor ! I stiffened my muscles and basically did a solo trustfall. Unsurprisingly, this went poorly, blood was spilt, and out of all the injuries I had as a kid, this was the only one to result in a scar.
Now, my sister. When she was a kid, she was a PEST, an absolute hellspawn. She used to pick on me at every opportunity she got, and she felt no remorse nor a need to own up to her doing. For instance, one time she stole all of my father's coin collection, and even while she was forced to do chores to pay up for months, she denied everything during that time.
Cut back to me crying and hurt on the floor. My parents immediately heard me and ran out, and I blamed the perfect scapegoat. Not once did my parents doubt my words, as they knew my sister was fully capable of doing such a thing, and they also knew her pleading non guilty was most likely a lie. She got a pretty hefty time-out after that, and I got bandages.
All and all, I don't really feel bad for what happened. The dust has settled, I'm probably the only one who remembers this whole debacle, and most importantly my sister has grown out of her demonic phase."	1cokug3	i blamed my sister for a scar that i caused myself	"if you look at the back of my head youll see a sizable scar running across my scalp ask my parents on how this came to be and theyll tell you my older sister pushed me in the garages and i hit my head on the concrete but that is but a ruse a lie concocted to save my  years old self from being seen as an idiot

188	The day I place my large feces under my parents bed	I was 5 or 6 years old and I had just gotten home from school. When I got home from school I liked to hop on my parents samsung tablet :| and play minecraft. But today my mum didnt allow me to because I hadnt done my chores. So as any normal response I completely lost my shit and stormed off to my room. Within my room I was thinking on how I could get my revenge when i needed to go to the toilet to take a FAT dump. On the toilet I had an idea so i covered my hand in toilet paper and put it under my ass and tried to catch my shit but it was too sloppy the first time so I had to wait til tomorrow. So the next day because I was 5 years old I came home from school DEHYDRATED AF and sat on the toilet trying to force a shit out of me. I think I sat on the toilet for an hour or so before I finally felt a turd sliding out of my asshole i cover my hand in toilet paper and caught the solid turd in it. I stand up and put it on the the basin to wrap it up. I then poked some holes in the wrapping and walked it down to my parents bed and hid it under some old magazines that my parents had under the bed. I KID YOU NOT they didnt find it for weeks and it brought me great joy to know that my turd was stinking up there bedroom more and more everyday. My parents got air freshners and everything until after like a month they decided to look if something had died in there room they look under there bed and move the old magazines to find my MOLDY SHIT. My mum screamed in horror as my dad rushed over. but they didnt suspect it was me they ended up thinking it was one of my uncles friends that was renovating our house at the time which my dad fired and i fealt terrible because the poor man got told that he was fired for something I did. to this day I havnt told anyone the truth to this story and my parents never found out that it was I who place the shit under there bed.	1cok08c	the day i place my large feces under my parents bed	i was  or  years old and i had just gotten home from school when i got home from school i liked to hop on my parents samsung tablet  and play minecraft but today my mum didnt allow me to because i hadnt done my chores so as any normal response i completely lost my shit and stormed off to my room within my room i was thinking on how i could get my revenge when i needed to go to the toilet to take a fat dump on the toilet i had an idea so i covered my hand in toilet paper and put it under my ass and tried to catch my shit but it was too sloppy the first time so i had to wait til tomorrow so the next day because i was  years old i came home from school dehydrated af and sat on the toilet trying to force a shit out of me i think i sat on the toilet for an hour or so before i finally felt a turd sliding out of my asshole i cover my hand in toilet paper and caught the solid turd in it i stand up and put it on the the basin to wrap it up i then poked some holes in the wrapping and walked it down to my parents bed and hid it under some old magazines that my parents had under the bed i kid you not they didnt find it for weeks and it brought me great joy to know that my turd was stinking up there bedroom more and more everyday my parents got air freshners and everything until after like a month they decided to look if something had died in there room they look under there bed and move the old magazines to find my moldy shit my mum screamed in horror as my dad rushed over but they didnt suspect it was me they ended up thinking it was one of my uncles friends that was renovating our house at the time which my dad fired and i fealt terrible because the poor man got told that he was fired for something i did to this day i havnt told anyone the truth to this story and my parents never found out that it was i who place the shit under there bed	cokc
189	I convinced my dad not to go to rehab even though he should've	"A month ago my dad got really high and fell asleep in our front yard, when I helped him inside he just started crying saying how he felt he'd fucked up my life, fucked up his marriage and all that and he started promising he was going to change and he'd look into detox or rehab. I told him it was fine and he was fine and he that he shouldn't do rehab, I said a lot of stuff that wasn't true and eventually he just said okay and went to sleep and he hasn't brought it up since. 

I didn't want him to go for a lot of reasons, mainly because I'm selfish and when my dad's fucked uo he doesn't pay attention or get upset about whatever shit I'm up to. I can get high or drunk and fuck about all day or spend all day playing video games ar any of the teenage shit that people get told off for. He said a lot of times that he'd get clean and he's even tried it a couple times at home and eventually he quits quitting and maybe thats for the best because as fucked up as it is I prefer when my dad's high, he keeps functional most of the time ands till manages to keep a roof over our head and stuff, and he's happier most of the time smokes weed with me and spends time with me and I dont think a lot of dad's would do that. And I just dont think theres a point for him doing rehab, because it wouldnt stick and he'd probably be worse off and even trying is kind of worth fuck all because all the bad shit ""ive ruined your life"" stuff has already happened and he can't go back in time and keep our family together or not fuck up my childhood or any other of the shitty stuff hes done sso thers just no fucking point.

Obviously I know all that stuff is selfish at the end of the day, but I still cant make myself stop thinking it, or thinking that if I hadn't changed his mind maybe he'd have gone to rehab and actually fixed himself and that wouldve been the time he sorted his life out for real. But I don't know and I cant change any of that now so what the fuck am i going to do with it"	1coina7	i convinced my dad not to go to rehab even though he shouldve	"a month ago my dad got really high and fell asleep in our front yard when i helped him inside he just started crying saying how he felt hed fucked up my life fucked up his marriage and all that and he started promising he was going to change and hed look into detox or rehab i told him it was fine and he was fine and he that he shouldnt do rehab i said a lot of stuff that wasnt true and eventually he just said okay and went to sleep and he hasnt brought it up since

190	I searched up strip clubs for a rpg and got my brother in trouble	"When I was 12 I used to play rpgs with my friends religiously. At that time I was deep into kpop and our rpgs mostly revolved around an imaginary universe in which we would play our favourite idols, now I can see how fucked up it was but we all were young teens obsessed with wattpad fanfictions (iykyk) and trying to have some harmless fun. 

So there was this one time when I needed to photoshop a picture of some of our idols into a strip club (for the plot) and searched up strip clubs on my phone which was logged into a family account. My older brother was at his friends house at the time and a couple days after he came back I overheard my mum talking to him about how she saw that he and his friend searched up strip clubs. She gave him a talk and a ban on his psp console and left it but I think about it from time to time and feel bad because he wasn’t the guilty one and I never admitted to my mum that it was actually me."	1cofk11	i searched up strip clubs for a rpg and got my brother in trouble	"when i was  i used to play rpgs with my friends religiously at that time i was deep into kpop and our rpgs mostly revolved around an imaginary universe in which we would play our favourite idols now i can see how fucked up it was but we all were young teens obsessed with wattpad fanfictions iykyk and trying to have some harmless fun

191	I purposely applied to a different University and got accepted	   I am a 19 yr old undergrad that just got my AA and i am now omw to university (classes start monday) and originally my mother planned for me and her to go live with my aunts house who is 2 1/2 hours away and has a university close to where she lives. Now i do love my family a LOT but the problem is, i just cant live with them like at ALL. My mom and aunt used to be abusive and EXTREMELY attoment to keeping us trapped in the house all day and to not let us go out and do anything and this went on for YEARS. Im actually still dealing with this shit to this day, when i come home from the gym (which is where i spend the majority of my free time) im always getting shit. Now my auntie on the other hand used to be one of the people i despised the most in the world to one of the funniest and most loving person ive ever known. My aunt used to back up my mom (her older sister) SOOOOO much in the past even when my mom did so much abusive shit to me but now my auntie sees me as a human being and is actually genuinely nice to me and i LOVE being around her especially when she visits. Again the problem is my mom, if i have to go to my aunts house my mom is gonna come with me and im afraid all that character development my aunt gained will just go right out the window and i just dont have the patience to deal with the same shit i had to deal with in the past with them. I would LOVE if i can go to my aunts house myself without my mom or since i also live with my grandma i would love to go with her as well but living with my mom is NOT what im trying to do so what i did was apply at a university thats a couple hours away and got accepted so i am going to set up a plan to get a dorm there.  I can pay for it myself and im going to try and do sports there, i just want to be away. I can tolerate living with my family, my auntie? Yes, my grandma? Yes, my uncle?

192	I made a.. very heavy mess in my school's school bus.	"I know this may seem a little.. less harsh then some, but it is something I needed off my chest.

So I was on a MAP trip, where last year, if you got a good grade on a MAP test, you could go to this trip. We went to the place, then to an Andy's, which sells ice cream. It was first time having Andy's so I definitely wanted to try something, so I kept some money my mom gave me so I could get something. As I got my simple vanilla ice cream, since I'm a very simple person, and I sat outside on a little bench with my ice cream. One of the teachers, which was my ELA teacher, probably made one the worse choices she probably had ever made, by making me go into the bus.. while I barely even started eating my ice cream.
I tried my genuinely best to not make a mess, but ice cream is WAY more messy then you probably think. Every second, it dripped on the floor. I felt so uncomfortable with how I was making a tiny puddle of somewhat melted ice cream, plus, I don't like talking to people, made it so that I said nothing about what was going on. I just quickly ate my ice cream so I wouldn't make a big mess.. which still happened. My anxiety was so high I was imaging what would happen when a teacher saw the mess. As I finished my Cone, I casually threw it away, like there wasn't a big puddle of melted ice cream on the ground. Took and hour to get to school. An hour. An hour of a puddle of melted ice cream was just sitting there, moving along when the bus turned.
As soon as we could get off the bus, I rushed to leave because I was probably gonna have a panic attack. I sat in the room I picked for RTI for a couple minutes before the school announcement goes something like “All students that were on the MAP trip, come back to the bus.” I felt so nervous because I knew they saw the puddle.
A janitor was freaking out because the mess was so bad, plus, apparently some other kid spilt.. like an entire cup of soda as well? That just added to the mess. My math teacher looked more mad than she could ever be. She went on to say how bad the messes were, and that we could not go on trips anymore because of how the kids made both the place we went to and the bus messy.
Then, I can vividly remember a conversation going:

Math teacher: “So who did it?”
Some kid, probably 8th grade: “.. did what?” ( pure confusion )
Math teacher: “The ice cream puddle. The one that made a mess everywhere.”

All the kids proceed to explode in people saying that they didn't do it. “I didn't get anything.” “I didn't have money left.” “I got ( insert not vanilla ice cream )” and so on.
I was so nervous and scared that I said nothing. I looked neutral, but my brain was going WILD. I look around, nobody saw me make that mess. I look at the bus, people, multiple people, were in the bus, probably checking out the mess.
Some kid in my class turns to me. “You know anything, Sion?” “No.” I completely just lied right there. I feel so bad for saying no, but I did not want to hear would happen if I said yes. Yelling? Mabye me crying? Not today.
The math teacher then goes something like “Who did it? Say it if you did it.” Guess what? My nervous self said nothing. And of course, since no other kid did it, they said nothing as well. 
I bet that every other kid was probably guessing some kid, but me. Why not me? Because I'm a very behaved kid, and sadly, that's what I think the teachers thought as well. I never, at any point, was called out by a teacher or kid. We get sent back to RTI, and I just back to what I was doing. Like nothing happened.
They couldn't figure out who did it because there isn't any cameras in the bus and nobody said anything, so they gave up on the case.
So that meant nobody knew nor wanted to guess that I did it.

I feel so bad. I'm never gonna confess, but I'm so sorry to the people that had to clean that. I would be mortified if I was an adult that had clean that.

Edit: forgot to add some words, and needed to add some small amount of context for people:

– I'm in 6th grade. People assumed I was young because I mentioned a kid in 8th grade, and they would be right.

– MAP, in this case, doesn't mean “minor attracted person”, and ice cream is NOT code word for little boys. No clue what MAP stands for here, but it's a website where kids take tests on. I am not a MAP, I'm 13."	1coalni	i made a very heavy mess in my schools school bus	"i know this may seem a little less harsh then some but it is something i needed off my chest

so i was on a map trip where last year if you got a good grade on a map test you could go to this trip we went to the place then to an andys which sells ice cream it was first time having andys so i definitely wanted to try something so i kept some money my mom gave me so i could get something as i got my simple vanilla ice cream since im a very simple person and i sat outside on a little bench with my ice cream one of the teachers which was my ela teacher probably made one the worse choices she probably had ever made by making me go into the bus while i barely even started eating my ice cream
i tried my genuinely best to not make a mess but ice cream is way more messy then you probably think every second it dripped on the floor i felt so uncomfortable with how i was making a tiny puddle of somewhat melted ice cream plus i dont like talking to people made it so that i said nothing about what was going on i just quickly ate my ice cream so i wouldnt make a big mess which still happened my anxiety was so high i was imaging what would happen when a teacher saw the mess as i finished my cone i casually threw it away like there wasnt a big puddle of melted ice cream on the ground took and hour to get to school an hour an hour of a puddle of melted ice cream was just sitting there moving along when the bus turned

193	I'm drinking once a week despite telling everyone I now have it under control.	"I quit drinking for six months after coming to terms that I'm an alcoholic. Almost went to A.A but i vented with some good and supportive friends. One of which, continues to drink too but now has diabetes so basically ""drinking"" to him is like a few beers once a month. I have been lying to him more then anyone else. Because coincidentally ""I too have been drinking once a month""-if you catch my drift.  
At first I gave myself limits and rules and I really did try the once a month thing. I failed, after one month of one month drinking. Quickly my ""8 drinks at most"" rule ended with an incalculable amount. Quickly my ""don't drink other people's drinks"" ended. My ""time limits"" ended. And tomorrow, I'll be getting drunk again.   


To give myself any credit, once a week is better then what I used to do. According to ChatGPT and other research once a week is still alcoholism. I don't want to admit it may need to be cold turkey. Part of me still thinks there's a way I can balance healthy soberity and once and a while partying. Idk...I need to say this to someone but in truth...anybody I say it to will tell me to go cold turkey if they knew so that's why I'm venting to strangers on the internet who aren't going to stop me tomorrow.

UPDATE: Me and the owner friend talked it out and we're all good. (:

EDIT : Clearing this up.. this is moreso about the owner friend I met *because* of my association with the artist who scammed me. The artist is long gone.

Last year I got scammed by an artist, they disappeared after ghosting me for months and I wanted to get to the bottom of it in an act of vigilantism. So I fabricated a new alias as my ""15y/o sister"". After this all blowed over I started talking with the owner of said community as both myself and this little sister. Needless to say, it's been over a year. This person and I have grown quite close and attached to this idea of my ""little sister"".

I've heard stories of people lying about having kids and siblings to garner sympathy and this was in no way intended to do that, so much as a quick cover for something that was ultimately for nothing.

I know it's fucked up, blown out of proportion and could've been avoided. I had no idea how deep I was in until the other day and I am well aware of the shitty position I've put myself in with no easy way to go about this. I'll muster the courage to handle this eventually since I've recently opened up about it to two friends and they both are helping me ""amend"" this, just having a night where I'm fuming because of my own impulse and regret."	1cnsru3	ive been lying about my little sister for well over a year now	"throwaway account and omitting names for obvious reasons not looking for advice just venting

I almost rear ended him and this happened twice. I yelled in my car he didn’t hear me though but I said “turn your goddamn blinkers on!” I got off the highway and was stopped at an intersection and he got off too. He pulled up in the lane next to me. I rolled down my window and yelled at him saying “NEXT TIME TURN YOUR GODDAMN BLINKERS ON MONTHERFUCKER!” 



I had a lemonade drink in the cup holder and threw it at his car. He gave me the finger and started cursing me out, and I started cursing him out. After I threw the drink he literally got out his car. I got saved by the bell, cause the light turned green. I drove off fast, and he got back in his truck and came after me.

198	I use text-based AI to navigate difficult and uncomfortable conversations with people	"Nothing ruins my day more than opening the phone to a wall of text from a friend telling me how awful their life is, how no one loves them and they will die alone.

I am a recovering people-pleaser and I used to go to lengths to try and help these people, be their shoulder to cry on and put them in a better mood. Eventually my cup ran dry and I began being resentful.

I started asking google gemini for advice whenever a friend starts dumping on me out of nowhere. It provides really considerate responses that are much more elegant than what I would like to say after months if not years of resentment building up.

The responses usually acknowledge the person's feelings, empathises with them, then adds a constructive question to get the person to look at the situation from a brighter side. I copy paste them without guilt and hit send. 

It saves me emotional and mental energy, I get to learn new communication strategies, and the other person feels heard."	1cnc7l7	i use textbased ai to navigate difficult and uncomfortable conversations with people	"nothing ruins my day more than opening the phone to a wall of text from a friend telling me how awful their life is how no one loves them and they will die alone specifically when this is an almost daily occurence sprinkled in with selfsabotage and a lack of accountability i know i shouldnt have seen my ex but we slept together and now he dumped me again im going to kms

In a soft voice with her face a half inch from mine .and she gently grabbed my crotch. I'm not bragging but I'm bigger than most in that department.and she noticed .so she said you can use my bathroom.so I snuck around her and we put caution tape at the bottom of the stairs so nobody would go upstairs .

202	I have broken over 12 controllers over 5 years spam, i dont know how to control my anger	"I (22F) Always had a short fuse. Some things irl i would just brush off, i am not too bothered in person, but things like someone not understanding me or having to repeat myself is already too annoying. 

While IRL fine, i am extremely explosive in privacy. My main hobbies are art and video games, and both of those things are extremely frustrating, though I dont think im too bad at either. 
I have been replaying Bloodborne for like 7th time and everything well baby smoothly, Its my favorite game, but while running throught the forbidden woods i just Lost my shit and smashed my PS5 controller against a wall. I have ps5 since August 2023, and I already have like 4th or 5th controller. I had PS4 since 2019 and had the similar ammount (5-6 i think) in the time span. I think there were 2 Broken Xbox ones but one was broken because i accidentaly tossed it away while getting out of bed and got that one repaired. I never met anyone who would break as many as I did and feel extremely ashamed for that, especially after hearing Its childish immature bullshit behaviour every time i would look up if someone has same issues. 

I dont know why it escalated So much in the past year. I have extremely loving and supportive boyfriend, and while yes, i did lash out on him many times, he knows I dont mean it and i did always apologize. Bless him. I never ever did raise my hand on him or anything like that during my outburst. While controller Is disposable, he ts not, and i would never hurt someone i love. 

There might be some things. I did Always suffer from depression and anxiety, i am pretty sure i do have ADHD as well but i havent been diagnosed yet. My work isnt the best either, hourly quotas and minimum wage of 4,50€ an hour dont make up for good motivation to get out of bed in the morning. 
And while i do try to post my art, Its not enough to get anyones attention, let alone to start with commissions or career with my limited time and resources.

I dont know what to do. The outbursts are just ever present, sudden and with outcomes just like this, not having a controller because i smash it against a wall. Psychologist/psychiatristisnt cheap, neither Are the controllers, and i do want to avoid taking medication again (i made that choice after few years of taking antidepresants that just fucked me up). 

Edit: please dont tell me ""play different game"". I have repeatedly stated Its not a specific game or genre that makes me angry. I am able to rage to Minecraft, Its really just depending on what i am currently playing that i release my rage onto.

203	I wasted 4 hours of my time and others while sitting in a changing room	Today I (18M) worked 5 hours at my part time job at the local hungry jacks before my older sister picked me up and drove me to gymnastics. Before she left to pick me up she packed my bag, got me food, water and clothes to change into because there isn’t enough time to go home in between. I was a little tired from work and took a short nap in the car which only made me feel a little more tired :/. When I arrived I went to the changing room and sat there for a minute on the bench. I opened my phone to check the time and saw I had a massage from a friend and so I messaged him back and got distracted reading the messages of a discord server I’m active in. After a short amount of time i became self aware of my actions and realised I still hadn’t gotten changed. Stupidly I decided to keep reading, after all I wanted a little break after work. When I finally check the time again, it has already been 30 minutes since my class was meant to start and I’m still in my work uniform on phone. I panic a little and realise that even if I change now and go start training it will be super suspicious and people will wonder where I have been so I continue to sit and try and think about it. I can’t decide what to do so I just open reddit and start looking at memes to take my mind off it. Soon an hour has passed and I’m screwed for sure. Instead of cuttings my losses and just going out I stay in here and go over scenarios of what people will say and do. I already feel quite guilty about wasting all that time and now it’s just getting later.i have sat here for the last 4 hours of my own volition doing nothing when i should be training.

204	I could've saved my friend's life but I did nothing.	"This was 2 years ago I was 17M at the time. One day I went to the school toilets and heard someone crying, which is odd at my school as there was a lot of stigma for boys having feelings and whatnot, l ignored him, as I was washing my hands he got out and I saw him as he left, he was one of my friends let's call him David. I was so caught up in exams and everything that I wasn't very present with him as l'd previously been. 3 months later after exams he killed himself, he got no support very few people new what was happening but people just ignored him (we were dicks). He left a note and in it said ""my disconnection from society….etc"" I just but can't think that if I said something reached out he might still be with us and I can't let myself go as I know I could've said the right things (I go to a phycologist for other reason) or anything to save him."	1cm9qct	i couldve saved my friends life but i did nothing	this was  years ago i was m at the time one day i went to the school toilets and heard someone crying which is odd at my school as there was a lot of stigma for boys having feelings and whatnot l ignored him as i was washing my hands he got out and i saw him as he left he was one of my friends lets call him david i was so caught up in exams and everything that i wasnt very present with him as ld previously been  months later after exams he killed himself he got no support very few people new what was happening but people just ignored him we were dicks he left a note and in it said my disconnection from societyetc i just but cant think that if i said something reached out he might still be with us and i cant let myself go as i know i couldve said the right things i go to a phycologist for other reason or anything to save him	cmqct

206	i hid my weed in a box of my friends grandmothers ashes	"Last week, I (19F) stayed at my friend's place for a few weeks while my parents relocated to another state and I finished school. My friend used to smoke heavily but quit about six months ago and doesn't want anything to do with weed anymore. On the other hand, I recently started smoking and have become somewhat addicted. Despite wanting to respect her wishes, I struggled not to smoke while staying with her. One night, I returned from smoking and tried to mask the smell, but she sensed it. She confronted me, and I denied it, which she believed initially. However, my continued attempts to smoke led to suspicion and arguments. Feeling guilty, I tried to quit but i lasted only for a week. One night when she and her family were out celebrating her brother's birthday i decided to roll a little one and smoke it in the backyard. I left my little bag on the table and after smoking i just decided to chill in the living room and watch some tv. In my head i knew i had few hours and i just kinda enjoying the free nouse. Then suddenly i hear the car arriving and i realized tbey returned so unexpectedly. I panicked, because when hearing the car noice i started thinking about the smell and she got into the house so quickly i didnt know what to do. I had a gut feeling she would smell the weed somehow and wanted so search my pockets and everything this time and i was right. She was the first one to come inside and she had the look on her face as soon as she stepped inside the house. She went to put her coat away and in that time i, in a rush to hide my weed, I inadvertently placed it in a box containing her grandmother's ashes. She searched EVERYTHING, my bags, shoes, pockets, and since i dont have many things theres not much to go through. since she didn’t find anything I knew I was on the safe side, but then I had to blame it on someone else so I just said that I was out with my friends that she doesnt like cause they smoke and so on and knows they are a bad influence. so anyways now I know she’s watching my every move and there’s always always someone in the living room so it’s quite impossible to get my weeds out of her grandmother‘s ashes because the kitchen is connected to the living room and there’s always her mother working in the kitchen or father sitting on the couch after his work so there is always somebody in those rooms. And my weed is still just sitting in her grandmother‘s ashes..

207	I will never forget what I saw and said nothing at all 	"There was a boy who moved to our town when he was about 10 who was mercilessly bullied. 

He arrived in year 7 and was bullied non stop for god knows what reason. The peak of this occurred on year 7 camp at the end of the year. 

How it began I don’t know, but upon the commotion I went to his dorm on camp to see them throwing his stuff into the shower. His bedding, his clothes and his teddy bear. The boys were blocking him from pulling his stuff out as he screamed and cried asking “why”. I watched it from a distance and I felt cold. I was 10 - so 20 years ago. But it sticks with me. He was destroyed. The next night he pissed the bed and the teachers said he ate too many pears. But as an adult I know he was in a state of shock. 

That boy was tortured. I’ll never forget the screams. I write this choked up. I’m not looking for absolution but fuck. I can see lots of kids post here. Please for the love of all that is good say something. It will haunt you for decades to come. 

That the teachers didn’t step up I don’t know. 

But yeah, this one sticks with me. God I hope he’s okay. "	1clitsn	i will never forget what i saw and said nothing at all 	"there was a boy who moved to our town when he was about  who was mercilessly bullied

208	Falling down the slippery slope of alcoholism and I’m not even 21 yet	I (20m) am a sophomore in college. I’m not doing so good academically and my nerves are shot. To cope I drink, mainly liquor (my grades were already tankeded before). I’ll take a shot or two before heading out anywhere just to ease any anxiety I might have. At first it wasn’t that bad as I’d only day drink on weekends and during the week I only drink after my classes and homework are done. But I started to drink while doing homework then eventually as soon as I’m done with my classes for the day (I’m more productive when I’m drinking). I’ve sought out help through counseling and I have an outlet for my woes but I feel so much pressure from my friends and family that alcohol is the only way to calm me. Worst case scenario for me is I fail school and I just crash on my friends couch, and when I’m drunk that possibility doesn’t seem bad at all (Even when I’m sober if seems a better alternative than living with frayed nerves 24/7). I know I’m still young and whatever but it’s really bothering me. I just know without my parents and friends around I’d get drunk every day.	1cl8puu	falling down the slippery slope of alcoholism and im not even  yet	i m am a sophomore in college im not doing so good academically and my nerves are shot to cope i drink mainly liquor my grades were already tankeded before ill take a shot or two before heading out anywhere just to ease any anxiety i might have at first it wasnt that bad as id only day drink on weekends and during the week i only drink after my classes and homework are done but i started to drink while doing homework then eventually as soon as im done with my classes for the day im more productive when im drinking ive sought out help through counseling and i have an outlet for my woes but i feel so much pressure from my friends and family that alcohol is the only way to calm me worst case scenario for me is i fail school and i just crash on my friends couch and when im drunk that possibility doesnt seem bad at all even when im sober if seems a better alternative than living with frayed nerves  i know im still young and whatever but its really bothering me i just know without my parents and friends around id get drunk every day	clpuu
209	I stole money from a taxi driver when I was younger and I keep thinking about it.	"I stole money from a taxi driver when I was younger, about 8. The guy had been a taxi driver my mom had hired to pick my siblings and I from school while she was working. I was in Ghana then. 
They guy wasn't the best taxi driver, my mother got angry at him once when he drove miles away from our house to drop off another customer when he was supposed to drop us of first. He even passed by our house and he ignored me and my siblings when we told him to drop us off so we can walk (it was a short distance)

Anyway, he left the taxi with us in it, one day after school he went to get something, and the money was there sitting out in the open, it was about 20 Ghana cedis. And I remembered that he wasn't the best person. So I took the money only 10 cedis. I remember sharing it with my siblings and buying lunch at school with it.

Now I've moved to England and I think about it regularly as a teen and feel guilty but I honestly just want to move on as it was years ago, I want to get it off my chest.

Anyway I just thought to share it on an anonymous app where people offer the best advice.
Is there anything I should do. I can't pay him back. I can only think about it.

210	I suddenly broke a big glass door in the airport but no one noticed it	My carry-on's wheels became lodged in the space between the aircraft and the loading bridge floor when I was the final person to exit the aircraft. I was so eager to get it out that I didn't even bother looking behind me; instead, I just yanked harder. I must have pulled too hard because there was a loud crack after it was released. The rear tire had struck the enormous glass door next to me, as I noticed when I turned to check behind me. It was severely broken yet still intact. I simply kept a straight expression and collectedly caught up with my partner in order to make our subsequent trip. That was not witnessed by anyone, I was not pursued, and this is the first time I have ever mentioned it in any capacity since it occurred. In my opinion, it has been sufficiently time to come clean as it was about December.	1ckr399	i suddenly broke a big glass door in the airport but no one noticed it	my carryons wheels became lodged in the space between the aircraft and the loading bridge floor when i was the final person to exit the aircraft i was so eager to get it out that i didnt even bother looking behind me instead i just yanked harder i must have pulled too hard because there was a loud crack after it was released the rear tire had struck the enormous glass door next to me as i noticed when i turned to check behind me it was severely broken yet still intact i simply kept a straight expression and collectedly caught up with my partner in order to make our subsequent trip that was not witnessed by anyone i was not pursued and this is the first time i have ever mentioned it in any capacity since it occurred in my opinion it has been sufficiently time to come clean as it was about december	ckr

212	i stole oxycodone from my uncle, and returned it while it was 20 pills down. 	"My uncle, around his late thirties has had a drug issue for my entire short life of seventeen years. he has had multiple hospitalizations due to it, dying three times, for a couple minutes.
He has said that he wants to stay clean, and he has genuinely made an effort to do so. 
last night we had a scare that he was out using again, but that was only a false alarm.

Two sundays ago, he had three heart attacks, due to the toll that his usage has taken on his body. during resuscitation, all of his ribs were broken. he spent time in the hospital for the two weeks after, and i almost cannot feel bad for others, but when i saw him, i felt sad for him. 
He, or my grandparents weren't comfortable going back to the area where they lived when my uncle was going to get out. drug use is quite rampant there, and they are easy to get. 

All three of them moved to my family and i's house just for the meanwhile. The first day there, last tuesday, i saw that they had a lot of medication. on the kitchen island, i saw some of my uncles. it was oxycodone. all i took that day was two measly pills, and i felt fine about it, because i thought he was gonna end up getting more anyways. 

the next couple of days, i would get more and more, using them at least every couple of hours. as of the last two days, it hasn't been as enjoyable. 

yesterday, i stole the whole bottle, because i thought he wasn't taking them at all. 

The bag where i took them from was gone when i got back home, but i didn't care, because again, i thought he wasn't taking them. 

Just a while ago, my brother asked me to spark up with him, but i was still nauseous from the oxy, so i declined. he went down to the basement to get a drink, which is where my uncle is sleeping. I sat at the stairs, because he was taking a while, and finally when my brother came up he asked if i had seen his pills. all i could do is play dumb and lie, and he believed me which i was expecting. I went upstairs and i did not want to get in trouble, so i got his pills collected, and put them back, right near his clothing pile. 

I didn't think that was enough, as he would blame my brother for it, so i wrote him a note. 

I would expect him, of all people, somebody to understand why i would do such a wretched thing, but all i have to do is wait until the morning to see what happens. 

i am able to get him more eventually, at least by next sunday, so i hope that can at least help him. 
he didn't seem to be in horrible pain, so i think tylenol at a high dosage should suffice for a little while. 

I do not know what will happen, but i feel indifferent to the consequences.

213	I got fired from a job and I lied about it to everyone	So I 19(m) got fired my job at a pretzel place. I told everyone that the reason i got fired was because someone asked for my shift and i gave it to them then said they called me 10 mins before my shift saying he couldn’t do it, making me 30 mins late. But the real reason i did so was because I tried to lie to my manager saying i threw up. The reason she found out was because I told her the day before that i hated working on a specific day, and it was the day i called out for. And now everyone is saying i should go to HR about it. I just feel guilty for lying.	1ckgyjo	i got fired from a job and i lied about it to everyone	so i m got fired my job at a pretzel place i told everyone that the reason i got fired was because someone asked for my shift and i gave it to them then said they called me  mins before my shift saying he couldnt do it making me  mins late but the real reason i did so was because i tried to lie to my manager saying i threw up the reason she found out was because i told her the day before that i hated working on a specific day and it was the day i called out for and now everyone is saying i should go to hr about it i just feel guilty for lying	ckgyjo
214	I realized I either have a bad habit or I'm a kleptomaniac	I (17F) have always stolen things. The first time was when I was about 8 or 9 and at a friends house for her birthday party when I stole her lip balm. (No, it was not used. It was a gift someone gave her.) Since then, everytime I go to someone's house or to the store or anywhere I always have to take something. Usually its makeup that I don't even really need or something so idiotic that I have no idea why I would even take it in the first place. None of my friends or family noticed my habit yet, but I'm scared once I turn 18, I could be arrested for stealing in stores. I'm trying to stop but if I leave a place without taking something, I'll start thinking about it and I'll get a really bad feeling in my gut. I want to reach out and tell somebody but I'm scared they will lose trust in me and think about all the things I've taken from them.	1ckbput	i realized i either have a bad habit or im a kleptomaniac	i f have always stolen things the first time was when i was about  or  and at a friends house for her birthday party when i stole her lip balm no it was not used it was a gift someone gave her since then everytime i go to someones house or to the store or anywhere i always have to take something usually its makeup that i dont even really need or something so idiotic that i have no idea why i would even take it in the first place none of my friends or family noticed my habit yet but im scared once i turn  i could be arrested for stealing in stores im trying to stop but if i leave a place without taking something ill start thinking about it and ill get a really bad feeling in my gut i want to reach out and tell somebody but im scared they will lose trust in me and think about all the things ive taken from them	ckbput
215	Girl on elevator might have been drugged and I did nothing.	"Almost one year ago on a cruise a girl and a man get on the same elevator as me (I say girl but I really don’t know how old she was, the man looked like he could have been her father). She was wobbly and the man she got on with was holding her arm to keep her from wandering around, she looked very zoned out wasn’t saying a word. I got worried thought about asking her if she was okay even though I knew she wasn’t. She was so out of it, the guy she was with looked very annoyed as if this happens a lot.

I had no idea what to do it looked bad but I didn’t say or do anything because “there are so many cameras around no one would do that right?” & nobody else on the elevator seemed concerned.

I feel so ashamed that I let the fear of being wrong and causing a scene stop me from potentially stopping someone from being raped. Please stay safe out there.

Edit: thank you to everyone that commented. It was nice to hear point of views on this, I’m sure I’ll always hold shame with the memory but i will try to let go.

218	I’ve ignored my college coursework for the better part of 3 months	"          For the most part, the past three months of my life have been a strange, hazy, unfamiliar fog. 
I’m a “full time” student, sophomore in college. Last fall, my first semester of my new, swankier  school was extremely hard for me. I ignored my coursework, ethics, my previous morals, and started to party, run, hide, and use substances to forget how hard school was. My addictions became, and still are my main coping mechanisms. It feels like my poorly developed prefrontal cortex, poor choices, and complete disregard of schoolwork has hurled me into a anxious spiral of skipping my work and trying to forget about it, all while trying to be as happy and content as possible despite my horrible reality. That first semester I failed two of my classes, had never done in my life, I came up with excuses for my parents and friends and said “next semester will be better”. 
         Expectedly, this semester I fell into the same habits. I’m so incredibly full of anxiety, anger towards myself, embarrassment, and mostly guilt, for my family who has helped me pay my way through school. I have lied to my parents for the most part about this semester, in which I have mostly ignored my schoolwork, but I’ve told them the opposite so they won’t be disappointed. I hate being dishonest with my parents but it doesn’t even feel like me. It feels like I’ve been taken over by something else and I might have serious mental health issues. I’m starting to think about taking a semester off to seriously improve my wellbeing as I fear if I keep this up much longer I’ll do something rash. I have a therapist I trust very much and I am planning on telling them this within the next few days. I am terrified to talk to my parents and face their anger, even though they’ve made it known I can always fall back on them. 
          Really, I don’t think school is for me right now and I need to do something about it. I need to stop lying and dodging my problems but it feels like there is such a long road to that. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated, thank you."	1cija4p	ive ignored my college coursework for the better part of  months	"          for the most part the past three months of my life have been a strange hazy unfamiliar fog

219	I’ve been destroying my socks for years, and I can’t stop.	"When I was in elementary school, I started this habit of ripping my socks apart. I would pull the string that were poking out of the seam, but the more I picked, the more strings would come out. I would keep ripping them to try and make it look like the original sock again. But after a few times of doing this, it started to be fun for me. I don’t know why but I would just keep ripping the socks and putting the string behind my dresser. 

When I got into middle school, my family and I moved to a new house. When we were moving out of the old house, my family took my dresser out the bedroom, and holy shit, the string was everywhere. My parents were PISSED, my mom started connecting the dots. 

“No wonder why I haven’t seen that many pairs of your socks.”
“That’s why there was string tangling our clothes in the dryer.”
“I wondered why halfway throughout the day, you didn’t have socks on.”

After I was busted my mom told me she wouldn’t buy me socks anymore if I continued this behavior, so after awhile, I slowly stopped ripping my socks. 

UNTIL!! 

When I got into high school, I was so stressed out, I wasn’t a good student academically since I have dyslexia, so the thought school just made me feel so weak. One day I was in English class and I was supposed to read of chapters of our book, but I didn’t, and we had to do questions on it. I knew I would fail, I put my head down at my desk and out of the corner of my eye, there was a string. I started pulling again. This time I did it when I was stressed, and by this time I was making my own money so whatever socks I ripped up, I just bought another pair. Nothing could stop me now.

I am now 20 years old and this habit is still in my life. My family thinks I’ve quit ever since they busted me in elementary, no y’all, I’ve kinda never stopped. I can’t describe it, it’s like an addiction! Because whenever I have socks on, all I think about is how excited I’ll be to rip them later. 

So yea, I guess that’s it. “My Strange Addictions” hit my line.

221	i’ve been skipping school for two weeks in a row and it’s getting harder and harder to go back	"i’m a high school senior who is already committed to a college, and after i visited my out of state school two weeks ago, i havent been back to school. 

so two weeks ago from wednesday - friday i was at the school visit, then last week, on monday, i skipped to catch up on the work i missed, but then monday turned into tuesday etc etc and i haven’t been back to school. I’m practically failing my classes. like F fail. the work keeps piling up because im not there but i literally cannot make eye contact with my teachers without feeling the biggest amount of shame, embarrassment, and sadness. 

before you all come for me in the comments let me say something:

i know my college can rescind their acceptance for a drop in grades, i know i just need to do the work and go to school and explain, and i know that there is no excuse for skipping weeks of school at a time. i know all of the consequences and i know how terrible they are for me. but i just can’t stop and i don’t know why. i was prepared to go to school today; i packed my backpack, i got dressed, i literally got all the way to five blocks before my school and i just couldn’t go in. i think my mom has figured it out, and i know she’s probably going to beat my ass.

yes, i am ashamed, yes, i am embarrassed. i’ve been so anxious about this for the past week.

EDIT: first, thank you everybody for your responses. i’ve read all of them so far. a lot of people have pointed out that this might be a mental health crisis, which i am looking into, and I’m trying to find a therapist soon. some people have DMed me, so thank you. and i would love to talk to more people about this if they also want to request a chat w me.

second, i want to clear some things up since my explanation didn’t seem to be as clear as i thought. i will graduate high school. with terrible senior year grades, but i will graduate. my school works off of a quarter system, so although this quarter’s grades are failing, i will most likely graduate with a c or higher in my classes. my grades prior to this are all As with the exception of two B’s - one in sophomore year pre calc and on in junior year physics. also, i have always desired to go into higher education, maybe academia, and I’ve worked hard to achieve that goal. i love education and learning for the sake of education and learning.

that’s it for now. thank you all!

EDIT 2/UPDATE: like many of you said, my mom found out! super fun not awkward at all conversation. anyways I also went back to school today! I went straight to my counselor and explained that i have been having a hard time. we rescheduled my ap tests to the make up days and asked my teachers for leniency while grading my late work. thank you all again! i finally faced my problem, and I’m better off for it. i will have to work all of may while my friends are enjoying their last month, but thats what i get!"	1chnx9p	ive been skipping school for two weeks in a row and its getting harder and harder to go back	"im a high school senior who is already committed to a college and after i visited my out of state school two weeks ago i havent been back to school

222	I stole assets from a tixic vtubing group for my own	"(Sorry for any language mistakes, English is not my first language)  
(I think this might be something important but I'm not sure- I'm a teenager) So I have been drawing digitally since 2020 and in I think 2022 I got into vtubing. I got so into it that I decided to learn how to draw and rig (badly) vtuber models because I wanted to become one and take commissions. But it was not working out. Then I found out about groups and companies and I wanted to make some art and vtuber friends so I decided to create a group. I got 7 members in. They were all very friendy and nice people and now one of them is my boyfriend. But I wanted to make it bigger. So I changed the whole theme of the group. I had a really bad 2023 and was really depressed and art burnt out. I dedided to look for some inso on banner designs from other small groups (I already had a logo designed). I found one that I liked so much that I decided to replicate it. Right after I finished it I posted a new applications opened post on twitter and unfortanetley the people from that other group found that. One of them decided to quote retweet it saying that I stole the design. It didn't hurt me the most tho, I did change the design and apologized (without adressing that it was exactly me who did this but an artist from the group). What seriously hurt me was the fact that people started making fun of the fact that my bf (co-owner at the time) was a minor and that it was ran by minors. It was CLEARLY stated on the groups website that we're JUST A GROUP, NOT A COMPANY. I have also found out that I have TERRIBLE timing, because that group ended because everyone left cuz of the toxic menagement or something. I later on got a DM from the person who QRT the post and said that if I said who did that they would delete the post. I did confess to them that it was infact me and that I felt really bad for what I did and that I have learnt from what I did (they did not delete the post which I guess is understandable). I ended my group a week after because the stress and my depressive episode was too much for me.  
I'm doing much better now, but I have a WAYY to good memory to forget that which kinda sucks... I'm kinda worried that it might affect my future as an aspiring artist though...

PS: I have stopped being a vtuber too, might just be the guilt or smth (I sorta guilt tripped myself into leaving vtubing)"	1chj0aa	i stole assets from a tixic vtubing group for my own	"sorry for any language mistakes english is not my first language

223	I made my brother hit his head when we were playing during childhood	"When I was about 10 and my brother was 6, we were playing a game that was:

1. Throw yourself on the mattress on the floor from the bed (\~50-70 cm from the floor).

For whatever stupid reason I decided to pull a prank on him and removed the mattress after his jump, but instead of him jumping in a more safe position like we were doing he decided to go headfirst, even then I shouldn't have done this. I instantly regretted and couldn't put back the mattress on time and he hit his head on the ground, it probably hurt a lot and until now this sometimes haunts me."	1ch5rs6	i made my brother hit his head when we were playing during childhood	"when i was about  and my brother was  we were playing a game that was

225	I've been working years as a tutor, knowing it's pointless, clients are wasting their money, and I'm a bad tutor	"I've been tutoring for the SAT and ACT tests at a local center for 5 years. During that time I've been able to support myself and save money, even though I only work 20-something hours a week. But something that's always on my mind is that it's a waste of money. There are tons of free online resources. I honestly think there's something wrong with your brain if you're paying thousands of dollars instead of telling your kids to go watch some math videos on Youtube.

Not to be racist, but the director and other employees have pointed out that most (90%) of the students are Asian. I've been told they sign up because tutoring/education are part of their culture, and to them it's the right thing to do for their kids.

In my opinion, if they took the money they're spending on tutoring and invested it instead, it would give their family a much better return.

Most of the kids don't improve their scores. I'm serious. It's rare. I don't know what the parents say- I never have to talk them. That's the director's job. But somehow he gets more sign-ups, and we stay in business.

The SAT doesn't even matter much. I don't care about the test and never have. Some tutors have a bunch of test-taking strategies, but I haven't given them an ounce of thought. Somehow I've gotten away with not even knowing how many questions are on the test or how long it takes. All I do is show them how to do math problems and walk them through texts. I'm a great test-taker but an awful tutor.

I hate having this as my job, but it pretty much fell into my lap, I have no other skills, and I don't know how to find another job. Any other job I could feasibly get would pay substantially less.

226	Inadvertently pretended to be someone else on the telephone 	"Many years ago, when my children were young and mobile phones weren’t common place, one of my kids friends was having a birthday party. 

Now, the kids were all around 7-8 and the birthday boys grandmother was organising the party since she was quite involved in his life and we all knew her well. She had a very distinct voice. 

I was a busy mum of 4 kids of my own around this time and the old land line phone rang as I was cooking dinner and I knew it was her as soon as she spoke. The trouble was she thought she rang someone else, another mum called Mary and I didn’t catch on straight away that she thought she was speaking to other mum, so I sheepishly went along with it, trying to get her off the phone. 
It was too late to tell her I wasn’t the person she thought I was, as I had already started to answer questions about this other ladies family. I don’t know why I didn’t say something to her, I think I was a bit distracted with cooking and wrangling the kids, and embarrassed by that stage. 

She chatted for a few minutes about the party and invited this family to attend and gave all the details, even checking about one of the kids allergies. For all she thought she had invited this family, and checked them off her list. 

Once I got her off the phone I breathed a sign of relief until the phone rang again, it was her, she was now ringing me to invite my kids. 
I answered the phone in a slightly different voice than what she had just spoken to and went through the same motions. Yes, we’d love to come. See you there. 

When the day of the party comes around we attended and she was asking where ‘Mary’ was since she hadn’t shown up. She thought Mary had sounded a bit strange on the phone when she rang her to invite her, but couldn’t understand why she hadn’t turned up with her kids. 

I said nothing and I felt terribly guilty that the kids had missed the party and now the grandmother thinks Mary didn’t turn up. 

I never told anyone what happened and I still don’t understand why I didn’t correct her earlier on the phone  and I let it go on. 
20 years have past now and I hope she and Mary reconciled.

This woman had no love for me and my sister or for her own daughter.
She hardly spoke to us, she insulted us, she went through our things and stole from us.
In her eyes we were nothing, sub-human beings.
She made us eat expired things while she went to restaurants or to friends' houses with my dad. She made us buy our shower gels, our shampoos, our toothpaste. We had to ask her for toilet paper. Even our menstrual products. When my father went away she starved us.
She and my father would make long lists of household chores for us and tell us that homework came later or that we had to get up earlier before going to school to clean up.
Every evening we had to prepare their breakfast for the next morning. Even have the dose of coffee beans already in the cup. And every morning we got up earlier than them so that our tasks were completed. So every morning for more than ten years, after pouring hot water into the cup I spit in it. And she never knew.

231	I chopped a snake’s head off bc it was stuck in a bug trap	"As the title states, I found a small snake in a sticky large bug trap. I cut the trap up to make it easier to get off of the snake. I tried taking the snake off of the trap slowly, but it was taking scales with it and leaving such an amount of sticky residue behind that I couldn’t imagine how this guy would survive. 

I spent awhile trying to come up with solutions to save it, but I resorted to a mercy killing. Exotic animal rescues were closed, and I couldn’t stand the thought of just leaving the thing on the trap until they opened 42+ hours later. I can’t stop thinking about it. I cried when I did it. I’ve cried since. 

I held the thing in my hands for quite awhile while trying to save it. It was living and breathing in my hands. The worst part is I tried to make it quick with scissors. It was relatively quick, but just slow-motion in the moment. 

I just can’t feel right about it. I feel sooooo awful. 

Edit to update: you guys have been so truly kind. I’m really not fully in a place to feel better about it yet, but I’m really so thankful for your uplifting, encouraging and informational comments. Thank you so much!

232	I lied abt going to college for 3yrs to family and friends but really been doing nothing. 	"I am ready for whatever shame or anything that comes my way. I really need to hear it as a wake up call. Wrote this last night. sorry for the grammars I did write this fast

Growing up in a strict Asian household as the eldest child(21f), I've carried immense pressure from my immigrant parents. To cope, I've resorted to a web of lies, culminating in a monumental deceit: pretending to attend college for nearly three years.
This all started back in 2020, I went a community college (So still living at home) but due to covid classes had to be online. Well I lack motivation and my mental health (even now) was terrible. Led me to fail the entire semester, I should have just withdrawn from all my 6 classes I was taking but I thought I could fix my mistakes. Anyways I obviously didn't tell my parents till the end of the semester that I failed. I basically had to confess during New years Eve bc my mom caught on that something was up. My parents have both advocated for school and think its the only way to a sucessful life.
We had a major argument that almost lead my almost dad throwing and hitting something at me. During those times I opened up about my mental health such as depression and well that wasn't fun as my dad doesn't believe in. that stuff and while my mom is a little more sympathetic she still skeptical. That's besides the point, basically I got a job and my parents told me that I only had month to take i guess what was a semester break. It got me in another agrument bc i felt a month was tooo short of a break for me and that I needed at least a year to really get myself together. I lost that argument and went back to school. I did 2 really fast paced online classes.I actually did pretty good in those 2 classes. Managed to get my gpa slightly up, the next stem i did pretty deccent. It wasnt until spring 2022 were the grades came crashing.
I learned something abt myself during those times and its anytime I tend to to rlly well in something I stop trying bc i think everything will workout. I told my parents what happened and that I wanted to drop out. They gave me an ultimatum either I find some job and then move out or stay in school. This is were I fucked up, I wish I took the job offer instead of sticking with school. I mean i told them i'd rather work but idk the guilt i had choose that path ate me up. They looked so disappointed especially my dad bc his dream is for me to get an education. It REALLY had me questioning if im doing this just to please them which I was bc i chose to go back to school. Now this were the lies begin, I basically ""flunked"" out of college. So I couldn't take any classes for 2 whole semesters. ALSO THIS WHOLE TIME IM GOING TO SCHOOL FOR FREE! MY SCHOOL IS GETTING PAID FOR!!

So what did i do... I would pretend to leave for school then I deepen the lie by saying I was able to transfer schools and now my supposed graduation is coming up this week!!

Okay.... well the first half of the year back in fall 2022. I literally did nothing. I would just sit in the car or at my campus library and watch youtube all day. Anyways I ended up getting a new job. Wasn't so bad but I left the job. Fast Forward to January-March 2023 I sent in my appeal letter to my school and got accepted back to like 3 classes over the summer. Did okay? I did withdraw from one I believe but wanted to move school. Start Fresh! So I started looking up online schools or just any school weather it was a trade/vocational, Beauty, and just any sort of program to help at least have something. I told myself once I got that sorted out I'd tell them. I didn't get things sorted out, I still am. I started doing some self learning, I have a passion for film and graphic design, so been studying on that. Learning stuff on digital marketing through youtube bc why not. Maybe get into content creation, be a UGC creator idk? Ive been studying for the Clep exam incase i do want to back to college. I can just take test to get out of retaking all my failed classes, started door dash just a month ago while it isn't some crazy money at least I'm making something. Also go to the gym and been working on my health. Most of the time though it’s just me doing research and not getting into action. Mostly because I’m scared to take risk. I can’t even say the small things about myself to my parents. I don’t even think they truly know me. For example… I have an interest in fashion. I’ve seen these girls online start business where they help style people. They buy items and pieces that match the clients style and aesthetic. That sounds like so much fun and something I’d love to try. Another thing is psychology and even sex psychology. Idk I’ve heard some people say I’d make a good sex therapist with the advice  I give and how open I am about it all. Plus I’ve always been fascinated by these. Industry. Not that I’d ever join just so curious as to why one would choice that life and how as a society we indulge in it. Anyways hopefully I can share that with them when I confess bc i might confess a lot more than this. 

Either due to the depression and anxiety i got which i really should see a therapist for. I desperately need one!! Also considering i might have ADHD due to the lack of focus and commitment I have.

While not being in college or having an actual stable job, did make me slighty happy as I didn't have to worry abt an assignment due or a shift to go to. This 3yrs of self reflect, made me understand how privilege I am, I got to go to school for free and I've just been leeching off my parents for everything. People would probably kill to be in my shoes. I feel like I've been ungrateful and selfish for the lies I've told. You'd think after the first 2 incidents i would learn my lesson but clearly not. I haven't only hurt my parents but my younger sister as well! The amount of pressure she must be in, to succeed bc I ended up becoming the failure. I mean she's told me this recently so I know. I feel like a shitty terrible person like I've committed a crime. I know me feeling bad doesn't make me a shitty person but I just feel like I don't deserve this privilege life ive been given. My parents wokred hard for this and for me to just tear it all down. Like the only reason I ended up here is bc I failed a shit ton of classes in college and I’m not stupid it’s just I’m so lazy that it rlly hit me hard. I need some motivation, Like some good motivation. I have days were I feel strong and determined and most lazy, tired and undetermined. 

. Now, at a crossroads, I grapple with conflicting desires: to please my parents with academic success or to forge my own path towards personal fulfillment. It’s like what do i choose to do?! I’m already 21. I don’t have like a set in stone goals. Like I want to do everything and nothing at the same time. I WANT to turn my life around, I don't want to live with my parents forever but the future scares me! I honestly didn't think I'd be alive right now, not that I've ever kms but I have thought abt it. Even now ive thought abt that or running away instead of facing the truth. 
 
Tomorrow (well today since I just posted it), I must confront them with my truth, armed with a somewhar tentative plan for the future, acknowledging the need to grow up and shoulder responsibility, even if it means severing financial ties. I've read similar stories to mine on here, some got good high paying jobs and some even kept the lie going. Got fake degrees and everything! Wish some gave updates. My reaction is WOW!! It's nice to know Im not alone in this situation. Others have been there!! It feels good to get this off my chest because ive been keeping this to myself for 3yrs. Only one other person knows which I told them recently incase I get kicked out. .I know this is all fault and I really have no excuses. I can't keep lying as much as I want to. I CAN'T! I know they will definitely get angry but I know its out of love and care (hopefully). Im ready to turn my life around even if it’s challenging. Sorry making this so long.

Btw forgot to mention what I was majoring in... Education hahaha ironic. I wanted to be a teacher i guess. It’s weird I still do but don't.

Edit: If anyone has any advice on how I should better my life or if I should stick to college! If anyone knows any resources or recommendations to programs or anything similar! I’d really appreciate it! 

Update-ish: Well I’m gonna tell them when they come home from church or when I do bc I volunteer at the Sunday school. So I have to go to church… While I’m not super religious maybe if I pray to God or Jesus both can give some guidance or a miracle. Who knows? Maybe my parents know this whole time and are letting me keep up the lie till I confess. I’ve had my suspicions, anyways regardless it will be painful. Especially after church… my mom wants to throw me a graduation party and I’m sure right now she’s telling people about it. I wish I had just said something as soon as she brought that up yesterday. The more I delay the more mess it will cause. I’ve already delayed for almost 3yrs. I think I got so caught up in my lie it just never really hit me  that I had to tell them the truth. I’d leave every morning around a certain time and then I’d just do whatever. Forgetting this major situation. Hell I almost was considering buying a fake degree and saying I actually don’t want to go to my graduation anymore. Also I mentioned in the comments about needing school receipts, I was gonna make fake ones that would be crime. This is how mentally fucked up I’ve become 😬

233	I faked a pregnancy and a miscarriage to everyone around me. 	"My fiancé at the time (28 M) and I (22 F) were trying for a baby a few years into our relationship. We were going through a rough patch, and I thought that if we had a baby like he wanted, his behavior would change. Biggest mistake of my life. 

I was immediately regretful. I couldn't believe I had gone as far as faking positive pregnancy results.  I made the decision quickly that I could never let anyone know about this,  and I started making a long term plan to make things look and seem like they just..didn't work out for us. I promised I would take this secret to the grave with me, but it has been eating me alive every day since then. 

It's terrible. What I did was terrible in ways that I cannot describe. It's just so fucked up. And I don't even understand why I did it. I don't understand why, in that moment, that's what I decided to do. 

I know and fully acknowledge that I am much more than a huge piece of shit for putting someone through that. And I can't even honestly begin to describe how bad I feel for doing these things, and I should, to be honest. 

Edit: I've already talked with my therapist about this and we talked about the choices I had and agreed that the best decision is to tell him when he has a second to understand the weight of things. I've already talked with who I need to talk to to understand why I did these things,  and am seeking out the professionals I need. A lot of people here are only looking at things from one side,  but need to realize that I hurt a lot of people in this process whether it was badly or not. I had expecting parents giddy for a new grandchild, friends who were so excited for me and started giving me advice right away. I very much should feel bad about this, but all I can do is take the right steps now to ""repair"" things the best I can.  There really isn't anything anyone can say to convince me to NOT tell him about this for the sake of both of us. I needed to let go of the guilt I've been carrying around for years and that's all this post was. Admitting what I did. 

Second edit: Sorry this ended up being so long. I expected things to be a little busy but definitely not to blow up so quickly. After reading a lot of the comments and thinking about what the majority of what I'm seeing, I understand things from a different perspective now. I understand that bringing things up now would give him something more to grieve about when he's probably already moved past things. I will continue to just talk to my therapist about how to move past it without having to tell him. 

 Some questions answered:
1.) I am no longer with this guy and we don't reach out to each other at all anymore. 

2.) My therapist did not ""convince"" me to tell him anything. I explained how I felt about things and at the time I thought that he would want to know, so my therapist talked me through the risks and consequences,  and how I should approach things if I went through route I wanted to take.  Which is obviously out the window now. So no worries there.

3.) This is not a shit-post. My orientation/username honestly has nothing to do with this at all and all you need to know is that I do have the ability to conceive children. If I didn't, I wouldn't be in this situation.

235	My sister thinks I'm still vegetarian, but I quit 2 years ago...	"I (F22) became a vegetarian in secondary school and was one for about 5 years. When I got to university, I started dating a Chinese guy. We loved cooking together - it was a huge part of our relationship - and he would tell me how he wished he could share more food from his culture with me, but it was difficult because my diet meant I couldn't try most of it. After a few months, I decided to start eating meat again, for that reason as well as others (missing Mcdonalds, for starters).

&#x200B;

My sister (F25) is a vegan, and she hasn't eaten meat since she was 10, mostly on principle. She's a great person, but she's principled almost to a fault about these things and I didn't tell her at the time because I knew I'd never live it down. Well, it's been almost two years now and I still haven't told her. The past two Christmases my family had to save turkey for me for after dinner so that she didn't see me eating it. 

&#x200B;

Everyone knows accept her, and on one hand it's not that big of a deal to keep up the lie since we don't live together and telling her is probably more trouble than keeping it up. On the other hand, she'll find out eventually, either from me or the family, and at the end of the day it's not really her business what I eat regardless. 

&#x200B;

This whole thing is obviously silly, but it still feels impossible to tell her. I thought maybe I'd blame it on the doctor telling me I needed to eat meat for health reasons or something, but maybe I should just bite the bullet. I don't know, but I can honestly see myself keeping this up for years.

236	I have been lying to everyone about my college experience and now I’m starting to break	I (18f) have been at university for my first year- and needless to say I hate it. I’ve struggled with my mental health and I hate going to classes. I lie to my parents and family, pretending that I have good grades (which I don’t) I pretend living on my own is fine (it’s not) and I’m starting to break. It’s starting to affect my physical health too. Everything is just too overwhelming and I can’t help but cry. I’m contractually obligated to be at the university due to the scholarship I went with- but I just genuinely hate it. I came for art education- but realized all my art classes have done was made me hate my artwork- something I spent years teaching MYSELF to do. I also recently realized my sister, my precious little sister who I’ve done my best to be a good role mode and friend to- hates me. To say it broke me- is barely scratching the surface. It also broke me to realize the abuse I experienced at her hands wasn’t normal (I am physically much weaker than her even from a young age and am not confrontational).

237	I've been lying to my parents about uni and how I'm mentally okay	"I'm(18F) and just got into uni . Already I'm having a bad time and I feel very shitty about it . I was photographed in my room while taking care of my pubic area and I have no idea who did this but I've heard this guy talk about uploading something with his friends while hysterically laughing and I think it's him . I've been isolating myself ever since then cause after that I got stares and whispers , I don't know where he uploaded this cause I reckon I would've seen it by now so I'm worried . I get triggered everytime I hear laughter and have been sobbing none stop , at this point I don't want to be in this uni anymore and I've been giving my mother hints that I want to switch unis but she thinks I should stay , I don't blame her cause she doesn't know what's going on , but I really want to get out of this place . I've missed classes every now and then cause I panick everytime I'm outside my dorm , and with every chattering I feel like I'm the discussion. I don't know what to do and this is weighing heavily on my mental health. Should I report this and get the dude in trouble ? Or should I just bear it through . I feel so bad for lying to my mother . 

Edit : I opened up to my my cousin today and we had a long talk about it  ,and I plan on reporting the matter to the school now . Even though I have not told my mother yet , you guys were right about telling at least one person so I don't suffer alone ,I feel a little better now and I'm no longer suffocating as much  .

238	I pay my bills late and I don’t know what’s wrong with me	I make decent money and work a ft job. I’m middle aged. I have a problem being disciplined and hate being broke. So my rent is paid late, I’m a few mos behind, and had court about it today. I’m pretty intelligent and know better, but I don’t seem to DO better. I’m ashamed and have been evicted in the past, which is pretty much my biggest fear now too. I just made an appt with a therapist to see what’s wrong with me. I’m super hard on myself but I’m also a single parent and I’ll admit, my rent is high. I’m in a large city and it’s HARD. My last place was pretty $hitty and had a horrible rodent problem.

 I’m frustrated that my coworkers have been calling off every other day that I thought that I would jump on the bandwagon. It happens frequently, and with the same people. I’m taking the frustration out on somebody.

240	I'm lying to everybody about my mental health and wellbeing 	"*English is not my first language* 
So I've moved out 4 years ago to commit suicide. Well I'm still alive, but damn... it's hard. I thought that if I've convince myself enough I'll learn how to love the life I'm living.
I''m working two jobs, go to school, I'm meeting new people. 
People love me, I'm inspiring them to live, they tell me stuff about them how hard life is for them and I'm like ""nooo you're doing so great, you're strong"" I'm shearing my story like motivation coach. If I survived then you can too type shit. 
I've survived few hard years of abuse. I've beaten alcohol and drug addiction (people don't know that) I'm no longer cutting myself. 
I'm living healthy lifestyle, eating good, working out, going to therapy but it's all distractions.
I'm miserable. I feel like I can't open up to anyone. My ex never wanted me to open up to them about my problems that's on one half and the other is that people don't want to listen. They want to talk about themselves. I don't really mind it most of the time, but sometimes it's too much. I'm also lying to my therapist, cuz I don't want him to know, he's too positive. 
Everybody thinks that I'm so strong and happy but once again I've decided to kill myself. I've already handed my notice at work. My apartment contract is ending soon. I'm giving away my stuff. 
I'm going to overdose so nobody could miss me. Noone from my surroundings would miss addict. I don't know when I'm going to do this but it's just all too much. I should have done it 4 years ago when I had no friends and my family hated me. I shouldn't fight for my life. I'm giving up. I don't want to live anymore

242	I would steal from the cash register at Tractor Supply to buy ice cream 🍦 	"My first job was as a cashier at Tractor Supply. In the adjoining parking lot there was a Tasty Freeze. I was paid minimum wage and all the managers were assholes. So, one day I decided when they were busy to process a fake refund for a small item, around three dollars. Just enough for a small ice cream cone with sprinkles. 

Once I realized there wasn’t any security cameras at TSC, I felt very comfortable doing this for about an 8 month period. I never got caught. I eventually moved on to a better job, where I get paid more and the managers aren’t assholes. I have never stolen from my current employer.

243	I used my medical condition to get out of classes and skip school. 	I have a medical condition that affects my stomach. In middle school, I used this to my advantage and if I was forced to go to school on a day I didn’t want to be there, I would go to the nurse after a certain amount of class periods and I would claim that my stomach hurt. Due to my condition, it was easier for them to let me go home instead of staying in class. So I was able to skip school and many classes because I lied to them. I know my parents knew that I was doing this but because of the condition and because I was a kid, they let it slide.	1cbroiw	i used my medical condition to get out of classes and skip school 	i have a medical condition that affects my stomach in middle school i used this to my advantage and if i was forced to go to school on a day i didnt want to be there i would go to the nurse after a certain amount of class periods and i would claim that my stomach hurt due to my condition it was easier for them to let me go home instead of staying in class so i was able to skip school and many classes because i lied to them i know my parents knew that i was doing this but because of the condition and because i was a kid they let it slide	cbroiw

248	In 6th and 7th grade, I used to stare at this girl everyday	"In 6th grade there was a new girl in my class. I was always looking over at her. At lunch, she tapped me on the shoulder and she said ""hey you, everytime when I'm around you why do you always stare at me?"" I just made up a reason. Me staring at her was only sometimes I did it. And then me staring at her turned into an everyday thing. Everytime I walked past her in the hallway or when I saw her I would look at her. She would always say to stop stop looking at her. One time when we were passing by each other in the hallway I was looking at her again and she said to me ""boo little boy!"" She elbowed me to the wall. In 6th grade she was in my PE class and again I was doing it. She told me I act just like her little cousin. She also road my bus. She sat in the back and I sat in the front. Everytime it was her stop, I'd turn around to watch her go past.

She said to me once ""BOO! Dang, always be staring at me!"" I glaced at the bus driver and I saw her laughing. Someone sitting across from me asked ""why do you keep on staring at her?"" I said ""I don't know!"" In 7th grade she wasnt in any of my classes she was just in the hallway. And again, I stared at her everyday.

249	I was a horrible person in primary school and now I'm trying to make up for it	"When I was in primary school from around yr2-early yr5 I was extremely rude towards this girl i was classmates with-I will call her H. She was that student the entire class was condescending to I'm not sure if this is a common thing but it at least was in that school. I was no better and also treated H badly one thing people would emphasise about her is how much she cried but I think a)going through that at a young age gives you all the more reason to be so ""sensitive"" and b) we're all like 5-9 we all cried  a lot why was she ""overdramatic??? After year 4 our school decided to do a ""shuffle"" up to that point we were all classmates since foundation stage(which is sort of like kindergarten I guess it's just before yr1). By the start of yr5 me and H weren't classmates anymore except for 2 classes. I remember vividly at the beginning of year 5 while we were waiting outside for one of the classes I ""joked"" about how much she cries and when she got mad (rightfully so) I tried to play it off as a joke to avoid punishment but I really wish she didn't listen to me so I could finally understand the consequences of my actions then and there.

After that I don't really remember seeing her if I'm assuming correctly she left the school. I also left that school (for context I'm at my third school rn the situation I'm about to describe was in the second-I'll call it school #2) and in school #2 a similar situation played out. There was a girl a majority of the class disliked and belittled in the end the problem was fixed but it had me start thinking about H. That was a year ago and I keep thinking about her more and more. I'm 15 now and I am grateful I'm able to discern wrong from right now but that still won't change what I did so I hope to give her an apology even though it's long overdue. While I know simple words won't do a great change I think this is only the bare minimum I could do I hope I can get into contact to her so I can at least show her I'm sorry."	1cbapft	i was a horrible person in primary school and now im trying to make up for it	"when i was in primary school from around yrearly yr i was extremely rude towards this girl i was classmates withi will call her h she was that student the entire class was condescending to im not sure if this is a common thing but it at least was in that school i was no better and also treated h badly one thing people would emphasise about her is how much she cried but i think agoing through that at a young age gives you all the more reason to be so sensitive and b were all like  we all cried  a lot why was she overdramatic after year  our school decided to do a shuffle up to that point we were all classmates since foundation stagewhich is sort of like kindergarten i guess its just before yr by the start of yr me and h werent classmates anymore except for  classes i remember vividly at the beginning of year  while we were waiting outside for one of the classes i joked about how much she cries and when she got mad rightfully so i tried to play it off as a joke to avoid punishment but i really wish she didnt listen to me so i could finally understand the consequences of my actions then and there

254	I stole from my parents as a child, and it cost me	"When I was maybe 6-7 years old, I had a bad habit of taking money from my parents whenever I had a chance. I think I had this obsession with cash- I had nothing to spend it on, i had a happy childhood.  

I would keep it in a book bag in my closet, which is also where I kept any money that was actually mine like from birthdays and chores. I don’t know why, but one day my parents came across the book bag. 

Perhaps they just instinctively knew a 7 year old has no business having so much money (maybe $200 or so), or they put 2 and 2 together remembering all the money that had gone missing lately. Either way, they assumed all of it had been stolen and they took it all back. 

At least $50 or so was honestly my money, but I lost it all because I was a thief. Needless to say, my fingers lost all their stickiness after that.

256	I have everyone convinced I’m a sweetheart and I sometimes use that to my advantage more than I should	"In my defence I genuinely usually am a decently  pleasant person to be around. Im pretty chill with most things and make an effort to avoid confrontation. 
I’m kind to everyone as a default but I do feel dislike towards a few people based on experience.

I hate to admit it but on occasion that someone has really rubbed me the wrong way for whatever reason, I’ll 100% take advantage of the fact that everyone sees me as the girl that is never involved in an argument and can do no wrong. 

It’s a rare occurrence but when I have been catty with someone i will do so quietly and rely on them causing a big show of how rude I was,at which point I’ll just blink obliviously and let them blither as no one believes them.

It’s a tactic I use sparingly and only with good reason, but I am fully aware that I have created a few instances of social downfall for a couple of popular stereotypical mean girls etc over the years. It’s absolutely terribly manipulative of me but honestly I have never regretted it.

I do feel bad that so many people are convinced I’m a completely innocent and lovely person who would never say anything mean ever to anyone but I also know that the few times I  have it has been completely morally justified. Oops

its a tactic i use sparingly and only with good reason but i am fully aware that i have created a few instances of social downfall for a couple of popular stereotypical mean girls etc over the years its absolutely terribly manipulative of me but honestly i have never regretted it

i do feel bad that so many people are convinced im a completely innocent and lovely person who would never say anything mean ever to anyone but i also know that the few times i  have it has been completely morally justified oops

257	I took the blame for stealing her stickerbook and I had to earn money and pay for the book even though I never destroyed it.	When I was in 5th grade I had a best friend,  she and I were literally inseparable.. one day thinking stupid thoughts we decided to steal the sticker book of a fellow classmate because hers was bigger and better with more stickers and better stickers than ours. I was the look out, she stole the book, I took 3 stickers she took the book home. The next day all hell broke loose in the classroom the girl was so extremely much more upset than I expected and I felt so bad. My bf felt bad too, the girl was affluent and I couldn’t understand but maybe it meant as much to her as my Barbie collection meant to me.. I told my bf we need to sneak the book back in her desk- but she had done a number on it by taking ( and ripping) stickers off , it looked horrible. I put the 3 I took back in as near as I could .. so now she’s the look out and I’m trying to get this big sticker book that was more like a large photo album back in her desk and my bf took off and I didn’t know and got caught.. I took the entire blame, I don’t know why.. a lot of classmates exiled me and shunned me because of it I was labeled a thief. Not a soul defended me, my bf ended up not even talking to me ..I never told it was her that took it, I knew about it which made me a part of it too, she destroyed it when I had to come all summer long to summer school and earn money to pay this girl what it was worth and I didn’t destroy it but I did keep my mouth shut.  A few years later in junior high I had broken up with my boyfriend and this stickerbook girl started dating him and she spoke with me that one time in all the years following this incident the remainder of the years we went to school together .. small towns don’t forget.. never did anything near like that again .. ever.. but I never did speak up about who else was involved.. 	1c9cbva	i took the blame for stealing her stickerbook and i had to earn money and pay for the book even though i never destroyed it	when i was in th grade i had a best friend  she and i were literally inseparable one day thinking stupid thoughts we decided to steal the sticker book of a fellow classmate because hers was bigger and better with more stickers and better stickers than ours i was the look out she stole the book i took  stickers she took the book home the next day all hell broke loose in the classroom the girl was so extremely much more upset than i expected and i felt so bad my bf felt bad too the girl was affluent and i couldnt understand but maybe it meant as much to her as my barbie collection meant to me i told my bf we need to sneak the book back in her desk but she had done a number on it by taking  and ripping stickers off  it looked horrible i put the  i took back in as near as i could  so now shes the look out and im trying to get this big sticker book that was more like a large photo album back in her desk and my bf took off and i didnt know and got caught i took the entire blame i dont know why a lot of classmates exiled me and shunned me because of it i was labeled a thief not a soul defended me my bf ended up not even talking to me i never told it was her that took it i knew about it which made me a part of it too she destroyed it when i had to come all summer long to summer school and earn money to pay this girl what it was worth and i didnt destroy it but i did keep my mouth shut  a few years later in junior high i had broken up with my boyfriend and this stickerbook girl started dating him and she spoke with me that one time in all the years following this incident the remainder of the years we went to school together  small towns dont forget never did anything near like that again  ever but i never did speak up about who else was involved 	ccbva
258	I am that girl who innocently insults people and doesn't realize it	"All my life I have hated those (typically middle aged) ladies who talk too much and say horrifically insulting things to others innocently. I am in my 20s and I am realizing that I am that person unfortunately. I can assure you that I am, on the inside, a very loving person. I hate passive aggressiveness, and appreciate frankness. I am genuinely happy to meet most people I do, and the ones I don't like, I just avoid. I don't backbite or gossip. I give people sincere advice when they ask for it, and many friends have told me I give them a comfortable older sister vibe so they feel comfortable asking me for advice. Maybe it's that I don't think through what I'm about to say and choose to speak impulsively rather than thoughtfully, but over the past few years, it's become more and more apparent to me that I am unintentionally kind of a b****. This isn't really a confession. It's a realization. And it makes me really sad. 

I try to give in charity, volunteer my time, offer a smile and kind words to neighbours, always bring my best self for family and friends, mind my own business, focus on self improvement, but mistakenly end up saying things that could be seen as passive aggressive insults. I don't really know how to be kinder. I don't know how to be more thoughtful when I'm speaking. Sure, starting out in a conversation, I can be mindful, but once that flow starts going, I'm just flowing with the conversation without thinking about what I'm saying. I struggle with valuing myself as it is and carry a lot of guilt in general, I don't know how to get past this. I kind of hate myself for being this way. 

Examples of statements I've made completely innocently that were offensive to others:

1. Met an indigenous girl, I was fascinated by her culture and asked her permission to learn more about her culture from her. She was cool with it so I started asking more about their lifestyle, hunting, the foods they eat, etc. In the context of this, I asked her if igloos were a real thing. She responded normally, but later posted about me completely tearing me apart for daring to ask her something like that (about igloos specifically). 

2. Saw a friend being bombarded with verbal conversations on different topics with 4 different people at the same time and keeping up with them successfully. I popped in to ask him if he had ADHD because I found it amazing that he was able to do that. (In my mind, I saw it as a very valuable skill that he was able to keep up with so many conversations, and I thought it might be because he is able to maintain different streams of conversation - said as a compliment, if you're able to follow my train of thought) 

There have been so many of these kinds of instances in my life. It really sucks to be that person. I don't want to be seen as the person who is always hurting others with random hurtful statements. Any advice?

260	I faked my nationality and made a whole different personality to make friends…	"So I am in my first year of college, and before joining I was determined to actually make friends and be part of a friend group, considering I was alone most times during high school. 
The thing is I am Indian, like pure Indian except that I was brought up in another country. Currently I have so many friends and life is good. Problem is, they don’t know the real me. On the first day of orientation, some of the international students from our friend group were discussing about how much they detested Indians because of their lack of hygiene which is portrayed in instagram reels. As an Indian, I can guarantee myself that foreigners are the ones that film only the bad parts of the cities, post in social media and claim that this is what the whole of India looks like. We do have hygiene maintained, and most of our cities are pretty clean too. We are not surrounded by smelly sewers, dirt water or drains. Or else 1 billion people wouldn’t have been living there. 
Anyways, I decided to introduce myself with a different name and say that I am from Indiana(sounds pretty to close to the word “India”) and I also told them how I hate Indians and I hate eating traditional Indian dishes but loved Korean and Chinese cuisines like they do(so not true). I honestly felt a strong guilt, but I really want to fit in for once. It’s already been 8 months in college and all my friends are so amazing. Do you think i should tell them the truth or just wait for the next 3 years and 4 months? 


EDIT: it’s not just the international students in my friend group hate Indians…literally EVERY SINGLE international student that I know hate Indians. Also I am from the north side, Jammu, so like I don’t have the typical brown skin more of the fair side so maybe because of that they believed that I am from Indiana.

261	I accidently knocked someone's drink out of their hands and didn't do anything about it	"Some girl was walking either from or to the dance floor and I was walking adjacent to it and we collided and she dropped her drink. I didn't do anything about it and walked away. I don't know if she was drunk (it's safe to say she was considering the place we were at) and I was definitely drunk. She didn't confront me for some reason and I walked away.

262	I let a kids pet beetle free in preschool because it was ugly	When I was 4, in preschool, I showed up to class as usual, and a kid has a crowd around him. I go to see and a CRUSTY BEETLE was in the styrofoam cup he was holding. I was disgusted but whatever. Later, I find out that he left for a couple hours for swim practice and left the beetle in the cup on a picnic table. It was the perfect opportunity to unalive it! So I sneak up to the table and make sure nobody's watching. I open the cup and low and behold the beetles inside. I release the beetle and try crushing it with the cup a few times. It obviously didn’t work so I was sitting there wondering what to do. I let the beetle crawl away for a second before I get the bright idea to just let it go free. I put the cup back where it was and run off unnoticed. When he gets back, he starts yelling “WHERES MY BEETLE? WHERE IS IT!?” and I can’t hold it in anymore. I run away giggling and a crowd starts forming around him. Till this day no one knew it was me.	1c8k5fc	i let a kids pet beetle free in preschool because it was ugly	when i was  in preschool i showed up to class as usual and a kid has a crowd around him i go to see and a crusty beetle was in the styrofoam cup he was holding i was disgusted but whatever later i find out that he left for a couple hours for swim practice and left the beetle in the cup on a picnic table it was the perfect opportunity to unalive it so i sneak up to the table and make sure nobodys watching i open the cup and low and behold the beetles inside i release the beetle and try crushing it with the cup a few times it obviously didnt work so i was sitting there wondering what to do i let the beetle crawl away for a second before i get the bright idea to just let it go free i put the cup back where it was and run off unnoticed when he gets back he starts yelling wheres my beetle where is it and i cant hold it in anymore i run away giggling and a crowd starts forming around him till this day no one knew it was me	ckfc
263	I had a hit and run in a Wal-Mart parking lot. With many witnesses	"I had to do long distance traveling after working a 12 hour night shift. After reaching my destination city, I worked out and showered. Even after this I still had time to kill, so I found a walmart and slept for 1.5 hr. Upon waking up, I had to use the washroom. I found a parking space relatively close to the Walmart entrance so I could quickly step in and out. Upon pulling into the space, I hit a new Cadillac SUV. People saw, told me I hit the car like I wasn't aware, and took photos of me and my car. I was going to wait for the owners to get out of Walmart and I did a 360 visual inspection of each car. I've never hit a car before after 8 years driving and idfk what came Upon me but I saw more people approaching our cars and I got spooked. All I could think in the moment was, I'm 3 hours away from home, it's a parking lot and insurance is vague on crashes in parking lots and I left. Afterwards, not even a minute after leaving I felt horrible and was shaky and even went onto a no exit street unintentionally.  I didnt realize it was a dead end until i reached it. Is that a sign from the universe? That I fucked up and should turn around and go back? Kinda like, ""there's no way out of this, dead end, go back now!"". But I fucking didn't. I felt and feel brain dead, hours after. I don't know what I was thinking at the time. 20 mins after crashing into the car, I found a spot to calm down. I googled the consequences of my actions, too scared to be truthful with anyone in the world. If found guilty for leaving the scene, this is a hit and run and seriously illegal. My car has some serious damage to it, will cost a nice penny but I can't get over the idea of how I left the scene like that.

265	I tried to change my hermit crab’s “outfit” when I was 5…	"When I was 5, I had a hermit crab who had a shell that was painted pink with a power puff girl on it, Blossom, to be exact. 
I had her for a while, and thought she may be tired of her “outfit” (shell), and decided I should change her into something else. I found a cute shell from a collection of sea shells I had, and decided that was the one for her night out on the town. 
Now getting her out of her outfit was the issue; I didn’t know what to do, and didn’t want to yank her out, but somehow thought breaking her out would be better. So, I got my hands on a hammer (don’t know how), took her out to the front porch, and smashed her shell open with it, trying to get her out to “change her”. My dad came out because he heard me screaming after I broke the shell open, and he screamed too, not knowing what to do, and what the fuck his daughter just did, lol. 
Long story short, I brutally murdered my hermit crab at the age of 5. This still haunts me to this day, and I feel so much guilt, 19 years later.. My dad, boyfriend and I are the only 3 that know about this, until now.

266	I accidentaly broke my 2yr old little sisters leg 	"This happened about 13yrs ago, I was about 10 at the time and she was 2

My whole family was at the mall where they had a playplace, my mom was shopping and my step-dad was supposed to be watching us. Well my little sister wanted to climb this small bridge thing they had there. The issue was the material it was made out of, slippery plastic-foam-cloth like film over it (I have no clue how to describe it). She couldn't climb it because she was so small and her socks made it too slippery for her, so trying to be a helpful big sister I picked her up to try to put her on the bridge (mind you, this bridge was maybe 3ft tall at its highest). Well then I FELL and I think I landed on her, I caught myself to some extent but obviously not enough. She started bawling her eyes out and my step dad ran over asking what happened. I told him I didn't know and that I thought I saw some kid run into her and knock her over. I lied because if I did tell the truth I would have been severely punished and berated despite it being an accident. They took her to the hospital, then came back to the mall to get the security footage of what happened. The whole time I'm quietly crying because I felt bad. Turns out the mall did not have working security cameras over the playplace area. I still feel bad about it but ultimately it was an accident.

269	I sabotaged my friend’s motorcycle in order to stop him from potentially hurting himself	So my friend has always made those stupid jokes where he makes up scenarios in his head that he can run from the cops because motorcycles are difficult to catch. (In reality it’s because they don’t want to cause a crash so they’ll call off the chase most of the time.) I mean most people have made up those scenarios before so it’s really not that concerning. However he seemed very serious about this and he has a reputation for committing to an act he claims he will do, so it was somewhat concerning but still not enough to sabotage someone’s stuff. However when he bought a bike I asked him why in specific and he said he wanted to try and run from the cops. Now this kid has done some pretty idiotic things in the past but this is on a new level of stupidity. I wasn’t really sure whether or not he was joking however I work as an EMT and I have seen exactly what happens to people who try to run from the cops on bikes and I would never forgive myself if I was the one scraping his guts off of the road all because he wanted to do something he thought was “cool.” (Don’t ask me how committing a felony is cool but whatever.) So one time when he was out me and my friend pulled a stakeout and when the time was right we screwed around with the motor enough to the point where we thought it would be unable to drive. However turns out it wasn’t and he crashed on the highway… sorry buddy but he was completely fine, which is why you always wear a helmet. So I suppose task failed successfully. I suppose this is more of an am I the asshole thing but I think what I did was one of those wrong things for the right reason sort of things.	1c7ng8j	i sabotaged my friends motorcycle in order to stop him from potentially hurting himself	so my friend has always made those stupid jokes where he makes up scenarios in his head that he can run from the cops because motorcycles are difficult to catch in reality its because they dont want to cause a crash so theyll call off the chase most of the time i mean most people have made up those scenarios before so its really not that concerning however he seemed very serious about this and he has a reputation for committing to an act he claims he will do so it was somewhat concerning but still not enough to sabotage someones stuff however when he bought a bike i asked him why in specific and he said he wanted to try and run from the cops now this kid has done some pretty idiotic things in the past but this is on a new level of stupidity i wasnt really sure whether or not he was joking however i work as an emt and i have seen exactly what happens to people who try to run from the cops on bikes and i would never forgive myself if i was the one scraping his guts off of the road all because he wanted to do something he thought was cool dont ask me how committing a felony is cool but whatever so one time when he was out me and my friend pulled a stakeout and when the time was right we screwed around with the motor enough to the point where we thought it would be unable to drive however turns out it wasnt and he crashed on the highway sorry buddy but he was completely fine which is why you always wear a helmet so i suppose task failed successfully i suppose this is more of an am i the asshole thing but i think what i did was one of those wrong things for the right reason sort of things	cngj
270	I touched a girls thigh a year ago and guilt overwhelms me, as it should.	"As the title says, I (12 at the time, 13 now) touched a girls thigh. I had a crush on her, and I for some reason thought that was an ok way of showing it. I know I should have just told her, I know I should have realized what I was doing. I hate myself for what I did. I had, and still have, thoughts about cutting off my hands to ensure it will never happen again. She’s traumatized because of me. I would do anything to repay her for what I did. I know I should have been a better friend to her, I should never have done what I did to her. I’m a monster.

It wasn’t just that that I did, I also did some other questionable stuff during that time. I asked her if she had a snapchat on the first day of meeting, which was weird of me. Later on I asked if we could turn on snapmaps to see if we were close to eachother. And there was another time when I spammed the groupchat with borderline porn.

it wasnt just that that i did i also did some other questionable stuff during that time i asked her if she had a snapchat on the first day of meeting which was weird of me later on i asked if we could turn on snapmaps to see if we were close to eachother and there was another time when i spammed the groupchat with borderline porn

272	I've been lying about recycling our trash for 15 years 	I've been in an off-and-on relationship with some one for 15 years or so. Sometimes we've co-habitated, other times we've had our own places and just chose which house to stay at. Either way, taking out the trash and the recyclables has always been my responsibility. But the thing is, the general bin is always a few steps closer than the recyclable one.  My partner takes their carbon footprint very seriously, and if they were to find out, it probably wouldn't be grounds for another breakup but I'd definitely be sleeping in the guest room for a bit. Anyway, I decided to take the extra few steps this morning and dispose of it properly, and I feel like I did a really good thing today.

273	I broke a large glass door at the airport and nobody noticed	I was the last person getting off of the plane and the wheels of my carry on got stuck in the gap between the plane and the floor of the loading bridge. I didn’t even bother looking behind me to pull it out because I was in a hurry, so I just yanked harder. Apparently I yanked too hard because once it was free I heard a large crack. I looked behind me and the back wheel had hit this very large glass door next to me. It was still in tact but very much shattered. I just maintained a completely neutral face, and calmly caught up with my boyfriend to catch our connecting flight. Nobody saw it happen, nobody went after me, and this is the first time I’ve acknowledged it in any way shape or form since it happened. That was around December, so I feel it’s been long enough to come clean	1c7724p	i broke a large glass door at the airport and nobody noticed	i was the last person getting off of the plane and the wheels of my carry on got stuck in the gap between the plane and the floor of the loading bridge i didnt even bother looking behind me to pull it out because i was in a hurry so i just yanked harder apparently i yanked too hard because once it was free i heard a large crack i looked behind me and the back wheel had hit this very large glass door next to me it was still in tact but very much shattered i just maintained a completely neutral face and calmly caught up with my boyfriend to catch our connecting flight nobody saw it happen nobody went after me and this is the first time ive acknowledged it in any way shape or form since it happened that was around december so i feel its been long enough to come clean	cp
274	I faked having Epilepsy, but it turned out I actually did have Epilepsy.	"Weird one. When I was a kid, probably about 13 or so, I was awful in school. I had bad grades because I mucked about so much (I was diagnosed with ADHD) Eventually the teachers pulled me and my parents in and basically in short just said I was a shit show at school and they wanted to know why. I didn't want to tell my parents that it was because I spent all my time messing about, so I made up some bullshit about having spells where just blacked out and couldn't remember anything. I think I'd actually just seen an episode of casualty where someone was having absence seizures so I probably just thought that would fit. Looking back obviously I know this was a very wrong thing to do, but in a way it probably saved my life. 

My parents took me to the doctor about these ""black outs"" and I remember I was absolutely shitting it, because I knew my parents would be finding out I'd lied as soon as I got the tests. (they definitely knew I was lying already) But it turned out on the EEG I actually did have bursts of seizure activity when I hyperventilated. The MRI also showed something on the brain that is harmless, but that is a common feature in epilepsy patients. So when all these tests came back I was absolutely in shock, but I remember I was actually buzzing that I did have epilepsy because my parents wouldn't find out I lied. I was having black outs, I just didn't know I was having them and when I couldn't remember stuff I just put it down to the ADHD

I got put on medication and got extra time in all my tests, so for 13 year old me having an epilepsy diagnosis was a big win. Now at 20, I know that it really is not a big win. Epilepsy is horrible and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I'm lucky to only have focal seizures but even they are difficult to deal with. But anyway! Lucky me eh.

275	Going inside a women’s bathroom at a planet fitness gym	During the summer of 2023 I signed up for the free summer planet fitness membership. I never been there before and wasn’t familiar with the layout. One time I went inside the bathroom and as soon as I went in I stood there confused for about 3 seconds and realized I was in the women’s bathroom. lol. Thankfully nobody was in the women’s bathroom when I walked in. My heart was racing and I left the bathroom immediately. The men and women bathroom were very close together. I walked out and thankfully everybody that was in the gym were busy so nobody saw me walk out or walk in the women bathroom(im a guy).

276	I hit and ran a parked car, came back to give information but it was too late	I scratched a parked bmw while picking up food for an ubereats delivery. The feeling of impact was barely noticeable but enough to make me check. I saw the scratch on the other car but didn’t see an equivalent scratch on my own car so in my rush and panic I told myself it must not have been me who did that and drove off (I think I would’ve left a note right there if I had a pen and paper and wasn’t in a rush, I had left notes before. It was stupid of me not to regardless). It was only as I was on my way to deliver the food that I realized how stupid of a decision that was and when I went to check, I noticed a scratch on my own car that might’ve lined up. I returned to the restaurant but they were already gone, so I left my information with them and told them to give it to them if they came back and asked. I feel horrible and I’m extremely paranoid that I’ll still be charged with a crime even after returning to leave the note because I don’t know if that’s enough.

280	I used to get my little brother to sleep in bed with me	"Throwaway here

I'm a dude and when I was between the ages 17-22, I used to get my little brother who was between the ages 5-10 to sleep next to me.

It wouldn't be actual sleep, just light naps. He would come to me wanting something e.g the TV remote control. I would tell him he has to sleep beside me for a little if he wants it. He'd be reluctant and annoyed but would eventually agree

So I would lie in my bed and he'd be next to me. I'd be on my side and he'd usually be on his back. Sometimes I'd try and be the big spoon and cuddle him. He'd lie there frustratingly waiting for the 'nap' to be over and constantly ask if it's enough. Sometimes when he tried to get up, I'd pull him closer

I would then let him go and give him whatever he came to get. Idk why I ever did this. It was nothing sexual, I've never gotten aroused by it or anything. I just liked having him there close to me especially since he was so adorable.

I'm sure he thought I was weird as hell. Looking back, that was fucking weird and I'm horrified that I ever did that. I feel like a p-phile even though I never touched him inappropriately or even thought of him in a sexual manner ever. I have also never been sexually attracted to kids or looked at child p***.

Anyway, this was very infrequent. Just happened here and there. Probably like 6 times in total. I stopped eventually for some reason.

I feel really bad for him that I ever did that. Am I a freak? 

Edit: Our relationship now is great. He comes to me whenever he has issues, wants somebody to talk to. He's my favorite family member and I'm his, going by his words."	1c5ut7l	i used to get my little brother to sleep in bed with me	"throwaway here

281	I lied to my parents about applying for masters' programs and now its backfiring real bad (obviously)	"Note: I know lying is bad but please hear me out

TRIGGER WARNING: anxiety, depression, sexual assault. 

So let's start from the beginning. To sum it up: I'm an Indian girl with brown parents who had high expectations of me while I grew up.  Since I was younger the seed was planted for me to become a doctor, and that's all I strived for. The only problem was that I was diagnosed with depression at 14, 10 years ago. But no one took it seriously, not me either. 

The only subject I enjoyed in school was biology and maths, so I was like sure, I can become a doctor. My first mistake was I wasn't good at chemistry so I couldn't apply for UK medical schools. I also sucked at studying without external help so that should have been a sign. Still, managed to get A\*AA in my A Levels. 

Things were all good until I transferred to UofT in 2020. Uh yeah, everything went downhill. I was doing a double major and a minor in life sciences, which sounds like ""oh you're so smart"" while saying it but I was struggling to say the least. Got really sick in 2021 while doing summer classes and MCAT prep, took months to recover and whoop back down again due to resurfacing sexual trauma. Basically, my mental health was splattered on the floor, I was so anxious I would burst into tears at anyone raising their voice in my vicinity, I could not meet any deadlines. 

I was desperately trying to salvage good grades without taking time off or another semester cause I was already a year ""late"". I genuinely was so burnt out I scraped the bottom of the barrel and graduated with a 2.0 GPA. Yeah, that's where I ended up. In 2023 I lied to my parents saying I applied for Masters' at UofT and said I just didn't get in. 

Went home from June to October 2023, my mental health declined even more due to my parents berating me (didn't know it was even possible?) and I took like 3-4 months to recover after coming back to Toronto. Mind you, I'm financially dependent on my parents. Have been applying for jobs but no luck as of yet.  

Uh but I repeated my mistake of telling my parents' that I applied for Masters. Again. This time all over Ontario and the US. But haha, my GPA and lack of work experience cause I was chasing med school led me nowhere. I was too scared so I didn't apply anywhere cause I won't get in anyway.

Fast forward April 2024, of course my father is asking questions. He doesn't believe I applied anywhere (accurately) but now I'm screwed cause he's asking for evidence that I applied. Please give advice, and if you're telling me to just say the truth at least tell me how.

Thanks, save me I'm pretty terrified. But I think telling the truth will also be freeing. I'm so exhausted. "	1c5sodh	i lied to my parents about applying for masters programs and now its backfiring real bad obviously	"note i know lying is bad but please hear me out

283	I unintentionally destroyed a Girl's life and I regret it 	"Some people are quite influential in school and they can quite literally make or destroy ur school life  . When I was 14 I was pretty popular in school  as I was in basketball team . 

There was a girl in other section,she always seemed like this narcissistic and self obsessed girl .she asked me out and I rejected her . Later that day as  I was abt to go home I checked my bag and my phone was missing ,mostly every student was gone (it was a big thing for me to carry phone that time ) I checked everywhere asked teachers but nth  I was really scared cause of my father . My father scolded me really hard . The next day teachers asked everyone abt it but nth was found , but the day after when we had game's period the teacher who was helping me find my phone saw an other section girl in our class putting my phone in my bag . Yes she was the girl who proposed me , she confessed in front of principal that she only wanted to scare me she had no intention of stealing it .(Her mistake was she came back to return my phone ) Her parents were called . I was pretty relieved I got my phone back . I told everything abt it to my parents .my mom told me to forgive and ignore and  don't seek revenge. I was furious why shouldn't I .

Next day I told my friends what happened, told them to not talk to her  and it spread like wildfire . She didnt even said sorry,  For a week atleast ,after that she started approaching me whenever I was alone she apologized , she wanted to be friends, she didn't have that smerk look which she had before . I got to know that she is being bullied like students  eating her lunch , taunts in classes , writing with marker on shirt and all it made me angry that she is only being kind cause she want this to end . I started ignoring her more blatantly, idk if this gave motivation to others or what but her bullying only worsen it became a fun thing for everyone . I was aware but didn't know it was this severe until I was called in the office . 

My teacher and that girl's mother was sitting there as teacher explained me that it's been really tough for that girl past a year and as she was continuing that's when her mother snapped  she started scolding me that  it's all my fault , u r heartless u should be in prison and started crying and just left the room . I was on the verge of crying(I was 15 that time ) and I was angry too like she did bad to me and  I thought to be the bigger person and I'm getting blamed . I was too childish to realise she just wanted to vent out .My teacher realised my emotions, she calmed me and  she also said that other kids look up to me so If I just be friends with her maybe her bullying will stop . I was still angry why everyone is taking her side forget abt being the bigger person I will do the worse to her . 

As I was returning from office it was already past half an hour the classes ended as I was going to get my bag I met her in the alleyway.
And I just can't erase this image of her from my mind . She didn't have that confident posture like she used to  the two cuts in her left wrist  was clear and there was a linear bruise in her bicep it  seemed like from a stick . She was just looking down . My whole anger just vanished .
""Are u ok"" I stuttered. ""Ya ya I'm good ...thnx for asking "" she replied smiling and then rushed down the alleyway . I was  confused like just moment ago I was so angry now this,  what should I do . After a week or two her father got transferred as he was in defence and never got to meet her again . 

Now that I recall school it was really good mostly happy memories but what about her ,maybe I could have helped her.

284	i abused our pet whwn i was a kid and it haunts me	"Hey everyone, I've got a story to share that's been weighing on my mind for a while. Back when I was 7, I used to play some pretty silly pranks on our family cat, Rose. I'm talking about stuff like feeding her ketchup (yeah, I know, not my finest moment) and even shutting her out at night. Not cool, I know. But there's one thing I did that I can't shake off. One day, I thought it'd be fun to toss Rose into our backyard jacuzzi while my parents were inside. It was supposed to be a harmless game, but things went south real fast. Poor Rose didn't make it out, and I was left with a whole lot of guilt.

I panicked and hid her body in our attic, thinking I could bury the truth along with her. But man, that smell... It stuck around for way too long, a constant reminder of what I'd done.

Fast forward to college, and I'm rooming with someone who has a cat named Rose. Crazy coincidence, right? Seeing that name again hit me like a ton of bricks, making me realize just how much I regret what happened.

I've been carrying this guilt for years now, but I'm determined to make things right.

285	I scratched someone's car and left without letting them know	"I'm a new driver (I've had my licence for less than a month and I failed my exam once before I passed) and I'm terrified of my drivers being taken away because of how expensive it is.

I'm working part time at a school and I had my car parked in the school parking lot, and when I was leaving the parking spot I scratched another car. It was not very noticeable (I went and checked) and logically my drivers licence wouldn't be taken for this, but I was so scared it would I just got back in my car and left.

I need to go back tomorrow (yknow, job) and I'm so scared someone saw me and the person I did that to will be angry and ask me to fix it. (I'm barely managing to survive on the money me and my family make and this would break the bank)

I didnt scratch it on purpose, but I was fully aware that leaving without even a note was wrong and I should have just gone back inside and ask for the car owner or just wait for them to leave too.

I've been sobbing none stop since I got home, I spent the entire drive home considering going back and knowing I'm too much of a coward and too afraid to do so.

I just need to let this out, I'm so sorry to the person who's car I scratched. If it were me I'd probably be pissed, but I can't pay or risk having to pay. I just hope no one saw me and that I can take this to my grave, I don't wanna tell this to anyone."	1c4rrnz	i scratched someones car and left without letting them know	"im a new driver ive had my licence for less than a month and i failed my exam once before i passed and im terrified of my drivers being taken away because of how expensive it is

286	I faked having a friend by making a separate account 	"Last year, i was itching trying to get some attention from my friends. They're my closest friends, but sometimes its just the two of them. So i tried to make myself better and made them ""jealous"" as if they would even notice. 

I made another separate account on my insta and me and well, myself had matching profile pictures. Nobody seemed to notice, and i got kind off mad. But I wasn't really expecting somebody to notice either, i mean it is just a matching profile picture. 

So i talked to myself and screenshotted the messages and put them on my stories. Eventually they catch up and asks me who that was. I had to come up with a fake name and told them it was my ""online best friend""
They told me i finally got another friend other then them. 

I was craving for even a bit of their attention and i never seem to get it. So i kinda gave up, told my friends my ""friend"" ended our friendship and it was back to normal again.

I deleted that account, of course."	1c4nig5	i faked having a friend by making a separate account 	"last year i was itching trying to get some attention from my friends theyre my closest friends but sometimes its just the two of them so i tried to make myself better and made them jealous as if they would even notice

287	I made a girl quit school and it still haunts me to this day	"Back in 6th grade I went to school with a girl who was slower compared to the rest of us. Like she had difficulty learning and reading and her performance during exams was  below average. Once we had to submit our notes for correction and mine were incomplete, out of fear I said that the girl had borrowed my notes but was absent that day. When infact she hadn't. The next day when she heard of it she screamed at me and said I lied. I being the little twerp I was started crying and acted like the victim. Everyone took my side for whatever reason. For the next week or so she got a lotta shit for ""stealing"" my notes. Both the teachers and students ignored and dissed her. After a while she left the school and got held back a year. 
It's been 7 years since the incident. I never saw or talked to her again.

288	I purposely made my injuries worse so my mum would punish my brother	I (15f) have always been kinda sensitive, I regret what I did but at the time I thought it was justified. My brother (11m) and me were fighting verbally but he took it too far and hit me with the studs of his football boots. They’re new and he was really excited to get them, but I hated that he could use them against me. So I told my mum what he’d done and she just said to both of us “guys stop fighting” . He smirked at me and said some remark about me being a looser, which really set me off. I was on my period that week, so I was a lot more emotional but I went upstairs and was crying. I don’t know what came over me but I just wanted my mum to pity me and understand how unfair I found it. So I got my phone, and I started hitting the mark with it. Soon, it was very purple and I guess I hit it too much but I didn’t care. I showed my mum and she got really really mad at my brother. I hadn’t ever seen her properly yell before but she was screaming at him that my wrist could be broken. In the end, she took his new football boots away because he “couldn’t be trusted”. I feel awful about it, but I also can’t come clean, otherwise my mum will make me seek help.	1c444bj	i purposely made my injuries worse so my mum would punish my brother	i f have always been kinda sensitive i regret what i did but at the time i thought it was justified my brother m and me were fighting verbally but he took it too far and hit me with the studs of his football boots theyre new and he was really excited to get them but i hated that he could use them against me so i told my mum what hed done and she just said to both of us guys stop fighting  he smirked at me and said some remark about me being a looser which really set me off i was on my period that week so i was a lot more emotional but i went upstairs and was crying i dont know what came over me but i just wanted my mum to pity me and understand how unfair i found it so i got my phone and i started hitting the mark with it soon it was very purple and i guess i hit it too much but i didnt care i showed my mum and she got really really mad at my brother i hadnt ever seen her properly yell before but she was screaming at him that my wrist could be broken in the end she took his new football boots away because he couldnt be trusted i feel awful about it but i also cant come clean otherwise my mum will make me seek help	cbj
289	I used the opposite genders bathroom at work and didn't get caught	Everytime when I have to pee, it comes suddenly and the urge is very strong. When I have to pee I have to use the bathroom NOW! It feels like if I hold it I'm going to pee myself. At work we only have single use bathroom and only one person can be in there. One time when I had to pee really bad, I needed to go in the bathroom but somebody was in there. Went to another one and somebody was in there too. Like literally, it was so intense I felt like I wanted to piss my pants, or go use the women's bathroom. I didn't know how long these people would be in there, but I got extremely irritated how people were in the bathroom and I couldn't use it. I decided to just go in and use the women's restroom. I didn't get caught using it though. And like literally no joke everytime when I get this intense urge in public, there's ALWAYS something wrong with the bathrooms. Once I was at a gas station and couldn't use the men's restroom because it was down for maintenance. I just went to the back of the gas station and peed. It was at night and nobody saw me. Even though my house is 3 mintues away, I couldn't hold it until I got home.	1c3xjze	i used the opposite genders bathroom at work and didnt get caught	everytime when i have to pee it comes suddenly and the urge is very strong when i have to pee i have to use the bathroom now it feels like if i hold it im going to pee myself at work we only have single use bathroom and only one person can be in there one time when i had to pee really bad i needed to go in the bathroom but somebody was in there went to another one and somebody was in there too like literally it was so intense i felt like i wanted to piss my pants or go use the womens bathroom i didnt know how long these people would be in there but i got extremely irritated how people were in the bathroom and i couldnt use it i decided to just go in and use the womens restroom i didnt get caught using it though and like literally no joke everytime when i get this intense urge in public theres always something wrong with the bathrooms once i was at a gas station and couldnt use the mens restroom because it was down for maintenance i just went to the back of the gas station and peed it was at night and nobody saw me even though my house is  mintues away i couldnt hold it until i got home	cxjze
290	Me and my friend bullied a girl when we were 13 and to this day it haunts me	"Now there is absolutely no excuse for this, but at the time I was being severely abused by my father (like being punched and stuff) and I am autistic and ocd diagnosed.

Again not an excuse but just to give some context.

I lived in a seperate country as my best friend at the time and my friend told me about a girl at her school who had been calling black people the N word and shouting it at them in the street. Me and my friend then had the idea to make an Instagram account bullying this girls badly drawn on eyebrows. The account was literally called (girls name)‘s_eyebrows or something like that. 

It started off as ‘light’ stuff (well not light at all but idk how else to put it) just posting this girls eyebrows everyday with a stupid caption until the girl and her friends found it and got involved. My friend started calling this girl mean names like slut, telling her to kill herself, calling HER the n word and I joined in. 

We got quite graphic with it too like giving them ways they could end their lives for being racist (while saying the n word ourselves to ‘give them a taste of their own medicine’) (we were really fucking dumb) It was really bad. Really really bad.

Then the girls friend got involved. I’ll call her E. E was a practicing Wiccan and told me she cursed me and made a video of her doing it. She put things like rusty needles in a jar with my name in it.

She didn’t target my friend who started it, just me for some reason. In fact the girls other friends still follow my friend to this day and act like she didn’t do anything. 

I have made multiple attempts to apologise (sincerely, genuine guilt) to the girl and her friends but everytime I do I get blocked or they start commenting stuff on my Instagram account about how I’m a bad person. 

It’s been a few years now since it all happened and the last time I even spoke to their friends. However the guilt doesn’t stop.

I have prayed to God almost every single day for my actions, I have cried, I have asked my Muslim family to pray for me to get the curse to leave, I am convinced I have been cursed. I have bad OCD and I have constant thoughts about E and the curse she put on me.

I’m 17 now and E is 19 now and I doubt she even remembers it but it still makes me want to throw up. I’m scared that the curse is the reason things go right in my life then go wrong. 

I’m scared she will find my account one day and message my boyfriend telling him what I did. 
The last time I tried to apologise to her and explain the situation I was in at the time she just said it was good my dad beat me and then got her friends to comment on my page about how evil I am and that I’m racist etc. 

She is also the scariest person I’ve ever seen in my life. She’s about 5’10 tall and just idk looks really really scary. Like her face literally haunts me everytime I see it and I see it a lot because I stalk her Instagram and tiktok every single day to see if she’s posted about me. I’m also just weirdly obsessed with her to the point I want to be her. I compare myself to her all the time because yeah she looks scary but it’s in a pretty way like she’s drop dead gorgeous. Way more gorgeous than me.

It takes everything not to message her now apologising and telling her I wish I was dead for what I did but I know that if I did she’d harass me and my boyfriend or message him convincing him to break up with me.

My boyfriend doesn’t know about any of this and I’m so scared he’ll think I’m evil if I tell him even though I think I should so that he knows who he’s dating and how horrible I am. He deserves to know.

How do I get over this? Should I just end my life at this point for what I did because I don’t think I will ever, ever get over it.

291	I falsely claimed ££££’s in late train compensation 	"Anonymous for obvious reasons. 

I used to work for a company and was put on a job where I’d have to travel by train to various sites across the UK. These journeys were normally always around 3-4 hours. 

I’d never know how long I would be needed on site that day so my workplace would book me an open return ticket. The open return was valid for 1 month and came with a hefty price tag of around £400. But it was great for peace of mind knowing I wouldn’t miss my train home.

I started to get cheesed off and extremely exhausted of all the travelling. I was one of the lowest paid at my company but had to do the furthest and most travelling. Nobody else would get put on these jobs. 

One particular week in the middle of summer, the heat caused some significant delays to train journeys where tracks had melted (yes, melted!) and other various heat related problems. 

I was stuck on a boiling hot train, at the end of a long day, stood up (because open returns don’t include a seat reservation). The train had left the station but got stuck just outside so nobody was allowed to leave. The beads of sweat were dropping off me and several other people who I was squashed in like sardines with, stood in the vestibule of this train. 

I was around 4 hours late home that day.

Throughout the journey there were tannoy announcements about claiming compensation for the delayed journey via train companies website. I thought I’d look into it so I could let my company know. 

This is where it got interesting.

You could claim for the delayed journey and either get the money refunded straight to the original payment method OR get the compensation sent to you via cheque in the post to a chosen address. With a 4 hour delay I was entitled to a 100% refund. All I had to do was fill in the online form and attach a photograph of my delayed ticket. 

A few days later a cheque for £400 arrived to my home address. I waited to see if my company were notified and if they would mention anything but they didn’t. So I cashed it. 

My next few trains went along with no hiccups but I knew of other trains that would be delayed for whatever reason. I found a website that documented all train times. Actual times, delayed times, length of delays, you could filter it to certain stations and certain train journeys and you could search up to the previous 3 months. 

With my open return ticket which was valid for a month, I started watching this website for updates on delayed trains. Specifically from the station my ticket would be to / from. I’d find a delayed train that would fall within the time frame of my ticket and put a delayed compensation form in, claiming to be on that train, and get the compensation via cheque straight to me. 

In total I reckon I made around £4k-£6k doing this over a relatively short period.

I no longer work for this company and they have no idea I was doing this.

I kind of saw it as compensation for the shitty jobs I was given and my low pay, but it was at the expense of the rail company, not my company, and I do feel somewhat guilty for that.

293	I ratted out my best friend and to this day she doesn’t know that it was me.	"This happened roughly 3/4 years ago. 

When my friend begun highschool (she is two years younger than I) she unfortunately joined the wrong crowd. She started vaping, smoking weed and drinking all at the age of 12-14. I, unfortunately at the time was also vaping and drinking and although she wasn’t initially influenced by me I can’t help but feel as I somewhat encouraged the behaviour as whenever we hung out I would occasionally be the one providing the alcohol and vapes. During this time, her parents were having issues and her father left the family. She fell into a deep depression and was diagnosed with several other mental illnesses that I won’t be listing. Her behaviour became very destructive and her family became increasingly worried with her actions. Her mum and brother went through her belongings and found several vapes and bottles of alcohol and she was grounded for a very long time causing her to become even worse. Her older sister at the time was friends with my older sister and had come over for my sisters birthday. I joined them as they talked in my sisters room. There her sister confessed her severe worries towards my best friend and I came to a realisation as to how bad things really were. I told her everything. From the very beginning. All the times she had smoke weed, when she drank, where she had gotten the vapes from, how the people she hung out with were not the best, etc. I even showed and sent her multiple photos with evidence of her having vaped, drank and smoked. Her sister was insanely grateful for all the information and she later showed her mum. When my best friend found out that someone had revealed all her secrets she had an „episode(?),” which I’m not even quite sure wether that’s the right term for it. My friend told me how she would never forgive her sister and their relationship was ruined forever, which they previously had an insanely good bond. I felt so insanely guilty and horrible knowing I had been the one to do that to her. Eventually things got better and her mental health improved significantly. Her bond with her sister was repaired, however, she still tells me that it’s something she will never be able to forgive her for. 

To this day she doesn’t know it was me. She has absolutely no idea who it was. Yet, the worst part is that she has literally zero suspicion of me because she wouldn’t be able to image that I would betray her trust to that degree and that leaves me with a pit in my stomach every time I think about it. I’m so torn on wether it’s something to eventually confess to her or just leave it be.

294	My mother gave me pills and now I'm an opioid addict	"I've been keeping this secret for about four years. All those years ago, I was going through what was at the time the most serious and traumatic breakup. I was vulnerable. I had been through years of this toxic relationship. 

I lived with my mom at the time, and she has quite the slew of back and health problems. She got prescribed Percocet and very often tried to give me them. I had tried them before but they made my stomach hurt, so I often turned her down. She continued to offer them to me. 

One day I decided to take one, I was hurting from work or something. And I snorted it. It was great, my stomach didn't hurt and I felt better. She continued to give me pretty much as much pills as I wanted, and even offered some when I didn't ask. 

She moved into my grandmother's house once she went to assisted living. My mother gave me her old pills too. 

Now four years later I'm a ""functioning"" addict, as much as I can be. Nobody at work knows. And I only just realized how fucked up it is to give your child prescriptions. Idk if this is my fault or not but opioid addiction is a helluva thing. I've gone from Percocet to Oxycodone, to morphine, hydrocodone, lortabs, anything like that I will do to stave off withdrawals.

I got some fake oxycodone 30s one time and did them anyways. They were fentanyl. Coming off of that put me in the hospital. It was the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. I cried so much, and the morphine they IV'd me in the hospital barely touched the pain. Unfortunately I guess I'm so far gone that wasn't even a wakeup call for me, although I refuse to touch fake pills again. 

I've lost myself so much because of my drug use, and wasted so much time. I really do want to quit and I hate that I've ever done them. If I would've known how bad they were I would've said no, never done them. But I was ignorant to the true seriousness of it until it was too late. 

I'm at a breaking point and have been for a long time. I don't know what I will do but I have to move past this. I'm tired of keeping this secret from the world, from my friends, my family even. It's time to let them go. Somehow. 

Edit: there's been a lot of negative comments and assumptions here, no I am not blaming my mother for MY mistakes. I did not include ALL details here. It's a confession. To get off my chest. And if you can't be nice you'll be reported and blocked.

one day i decided to take one i was hurting from work or something and i snorted it it was great my stomach didnt hurt and i felt better she continued to give me pretty much as much pills as i wanted and even offered some when i didnt ask 

she moved into my grandmothers house once she went to assisted living my mother gave me her old pills too 

now four years later im a functioning addict as much as i can be nobody at work knows and i only just realized how fucked up it is to give your child prescriptions idk if this is my fault or not but opioid addiction is a helluva thing ive gone from percocet to oxycodone to morphine hydrocodone lortabs anything like that i will do to stave off withdrawals

i got some fake oxycodone s one time and did them anyways they were fentanyl coming off of that put me in the hospital it was the worst pain ive ever felt in my life i cried so much and the morphine they ivd me in the hospital barely touched the pain unfortunately i guess im so far gone that wasnt even a wakeup call for me although i refuse to touch fake pills again 

ive lost myself so much because of my drug use and wasted so much time i really do want to quit and i hate that ive ever done them if i wouldve known how bad they were i wouldve said no never done them but i was ignorant to the true seriousness of it until it was too late 

im at a breaking point and have been for a long time i dont know what i will do but i have to move past this im tired of keeping this secret from the world from my friends my family even its time to let them go somehow 

edit theres been a lot of negative comments and assumptions here no i am not blaming my mother for my mistakes i did not include all details here its a confession to get off my chest and if you cant be nice youll be reported and blocked "	cef
295	I was being a little weeb and broke my friends nose	"So when i was like 11 or something i was into naruto and stuff and i thought it would be pretty fucking sweet to put on some naruto music and chase my friend around the house with some shitty foam scythe thing 

He was hiding in a closet and i could see his legs sticking out from underneath a rack of clothes and because i wanted to be scary or something I pretended I didn’t know where he was.

(Some background info is I had this, like, foam scythe thingie i got from a halloween costume a couple years prior. It was pretty soft but the interior had this like hard pvc pipe in it.)

I then proceeded to yell some cringe shit and throw the scythe in a perfect spiral of the likes of Peyton Manning. It hit him and I hear him start crying and he comes out with blood dripping down his face and into his hands. 

What followed was the worst thing i have ever experienced in my life and probably ever will. My mom came down the hallway and saw him bleeding all over the bathroom sink and asked me what happened. 

We both agreed to never tell her the truth and we told her he ran into a door. 

I still have not told anyone about this in years and have lost contact with that friend.

Also p.s: I don’t watch anime anymore because everytime I do i get secondhand embarrassment thinking about what i did.

EDIT: I also never turned the music off so my mom walked into two 11 year old boys huddled around a sink, one bleeding profusely out of his nose- all while some like dramatic action music was playing "	1c0wnew	i was being a little weeb and broke my friends nose	"so when i was like  or something i was into naruto and stuff and i thought it would be pretty fucking sweet to put on some naruto music and chase my friend around the house with some shitty foam scythe thing

297	I was a successful underground fraudster at the age of 13.	"I was watching one of the Smosh Reddit Stories episodes (the Chaotic episode) and someone confessed on here to faking being sick to get out of going to school, and while I never did that, it triggered another memory. 

When I was about 12 or 13 in the late 00s (before I knew what I was doing), I would often use a sickness I had a few years prior to get out of P.E. class, and my mum would just believe me and send me to school with an excuse note and I'd be able to get out of class. 

But one day she didn't sign a note and I really didn't want to do the activity that day, so I forged my mum's signature. I traced it, and practiced it over and over again until eventually I had something that could pass for her handwriting. It worked. My mum was none the wiser. And so, I did it again. I didn't abuse my power too much because I knew the teacher would get suspicious and call my mum and I'd get in trouble and I really didn't want to, so I would participate in class more often than not and only use my newfound power as a last resort. 

Because of this (and the fact that my usual handwriting is cursive and no one can understand it) I've been able to develop a talent for writing in different fonts and styles.

But one day, one of my friends saw me faking a letter and asked about it. Because we were close, I told her the truth and she asked me to do one for her. I did and we both got out of P.E. Eventually, word spread around my year group that this was something I could do, and so some people would come and ask me for help. To the point where I had rules. 

1) Come prepared with a viable excuse.
2) Come with an example of your parent's handwriting/signature.
3) Grass me up and I lie. I'm very good at it thanks to a life with narcissistic and emotionally unavailable parents, and my older sister's goodie two-shoes reputation passed down to me, too. Who are the teachers going to believe? The well-behaved, heavily bullied, younger sister of a straight A student? Or a kid who barely does their homework and has a record of detentions for misbehaviour? 

The third one never would have happened anyway, given that my secondary school was in a working class neighbourhood in the UK, and you learn from a young age that no one likes a tell-tale. 

And so, I developed a small business. Every lunchtime, breaktime, or periods before class, I would charge 50p per letter and forge my classmate's parent's signatures to help them get out of class. I would use that money to buy myself snacks at school, or at the bakery or convenience store down the street after school.

The teachers never confronted me about this. My mum, 15 years later still has no idea. ""Well, why did you stop?"" I hear you ask. Well, it did end up becoming too risky. Someone from a different year group who had a sibling in my sister's year found out what I was doing and I didn't want the heat. So I only did it for me and my best friend again and I kept it on the dl.

298	Used to throw ice cream bars and eggs at my friends neighbors house 	When I was in high school my friend “J” and I used to raid his freezer for those mini dove ice cream bars. We would go stand on his deck in his back yard and chuck them across the street at the house across from him. We would occasionally switch it up with eggs. I have no clue how we never got caught cause we did it like every day. I even remember one Saturday we saw the guy power washing his siding.

299	My twin brother and I used to shoot spit wads at our uncle’s forehead, who was paralyzed and wheelchair bound.	"When my twin bro and I were 7 or 8, we used to roll up a bunch of paper as ammo and maneuver around the living room furniture with our straws like we were scout snipers, and take turns shooting soggy spit wads at our uncle’s forehead while he was propped up in his wheelchair in front of the television. He was slow to react, so when he’d start turning his head in the direction of our shots, we would low crawl to a new position for our next shots.

She died two and a half months later and thats the only memory i have of her.	1bzszwm	i made my demented grandmother watch two girls one cup 	i know it sounds fucked up it kinda is but i was a kid and i thought it was a scary video so i played it next to my grandmother in her hospital bed she died two and a half months later and thats the only memory i have of her	bzszwm
301	I am am a terrible pet owner and don’t know what the right thing is anymore	"Going into this just know that I already know how awful this makes me sound. But I am at such a loss and just don’t know what the correct, kind, responsible thing to do is. 

So for context I am a 33 year old mom to 4 kids who are amazing, literally the light of my life and source of Joy. I work part time from home and homeschool 2 of my kids. So I am home pretty much all of the time. We have a nice little fenced in back yard. We have a little house. 
We are the poster family for people who should get a dog right? 
So for Christmas the year before last my husband and I got the kids a pup from my bosses dog who had puppies. She is a black labradoodle and we brought her home when she was 10 weeks old. 
It started with normal puppy stuff which was fine, teething and jumping but a normal pup. We cleaned our basement and turned it into the “dog room” so we wouldn’t have to put her in a kennel when we are gone or asleep. We put a tv down there and she has a nice bed and toys. My husband worked with her so much the first year and honestly his work schedule picked up and she won’t listen to me. She really only will listen to him and he’s only home for a few hours a day. 
This dog has been the biggest challenge of my life. My hands are so full and I didn’t expect this to be the way it is. 
This dog will go at almost any length to eat poop. I mean she will chew a hole in the side of the trash can to get to a dirty diaper. She is obsessed with our cats litter box and I had to go buy a 75$ little box so she couldn’t get inside and she just gets her head stuck in the hole and boom, giant cat litter mess. She won’t eat dog food, like any kind except the most expensive stuff from the vet so I started making her food from scratch and it’s a lot of work. She not only loves poop but literally anything within 2 miles that’s dead she will find and roll in. She is a long haired dog and gets so gross I have to give her a bath at least once a week and it’s hard to do with 4 kids under 6 trying to catch some of the action. She stinks andI hate it. Now’s it rains like every single day and it made it SO much worse. I thought her and my cat would get along after a while but it’s been almost two years and they still can’t be kept in the same room. Now our cat is getting older and because our dog is so obsessed with her littler box now she won’t even use it and I’m so paranoid about my house and kids and clothes smelling like cat pee that I am uncomfortable in my own home. She dug a hole under the fence and got out for three days while we were on vacation and had a house sitter she got picked up and when we brought her home she was covered in fleas. We spent over 600$ treating her, our cat and home and I still see them once and a while. Keep in mind, we are a lower income family. My husband works and i do what i can but we aren’t rich by any means. It’s so much to keep up with every day.  My mental health is suffering. I always feel this glooming sense that I am a bad person for not liking this animal as much as I should.  I know everyone says you are supposed to get so close to your pets but I just can’t. It’s always something. And there’s so much more I could type but you probably get the picture. But here’s my problem. My kids LOVE this dog. They want her around all the time but I can’t handle it all day every day. We can’t get school done, we can’t eat our meals, we can’t have shoes out or a trash can or laundry basket out. Sometimes I wish that when she gets out of the fence a better family will find her and keep her. She deserves better.

I’ve done a lot of wrongs primarily due to my temper. I’m trying to do right by them and also working on my temper issue. 

I wish I was a better person. Im lucky I have them to support me when im down. I’ve started to find ways to spend more time with them instead of friends because I’ve started to understand things better.

303	I grabbed a girls butt at a party when i was 16 and her reaction the next time i saw her was so weird	"So i was in first year of highschool, trying weed and loving it, first big parties, ect...
I was super shy and borderline crippled about girls, but still had friends. Got invited in a huge shisha party, and started to drink a lot. I ended up in the backyard (we were at least 20-25 there) talking with a group of friends. And that girl that i didn't know was super drunk like me. We were all from the same highschool i precise.we were standing next each other while in a circle of ppl talking. I just placed my hand on her ass for some fking reason. It felt wrong doing it but I couldn't help. She then raised her eyes to me, and then looked somewhere else like nothing happened. The worst is my hand stayed there for soo long it felt like several minutes. I cringed and felt horrible over that story for years, especially since some friends noticed. Anyway i saw her maybe a week later. The scene felt like some higher entity planed it. I was coming back in the highschool for class, and she was coming out. The entire front and inside court of the place was dead empty, not a bloody sound even if losts of ppl hang out there usually. She walked out on the front bridge as i engaged on the other end, she saw me, i looked at her and felt super bad, was awaiting disgust, hate or fear... But then she gave me a bright smile. We never met outside of the party, no common friend, so she can only remember me from the party. This is one of the most bizarre stuff i ever witnessed in my life.
I mean she probably just didn't care but damn that's some serious level of chillness

Edit : wow i didn't expect a storm of conflicting thoughts like that. I have written this fast, in a one shot idea, just because i discovered this sub, not thinking i could reach so many people. I would have definitely not have taken such a light tone if I had known. I want to say i know there is nothing right about it. Those who called me a creep are correct, i acted like a creep back then. I'm sorry about those of you who lived a sexual assault and might have been hurt reading this. I'm in no way saying that it was okay or anyone should do this. I was a frustrated and anxious kid and that led me to touch a girl without her consent. Alcohol is a big factor but doesn't excuse anything. Be sure of one thing though, i didn't only ""cringe"" at it, i hated myself and found myself disgusting. I never did anything like it again. Discovering sexual pulsion and alcohol at the same time as a boy is dangerous for girls. I understood how strong alcohol was and how bad the consequences of my actions could get if i let my pulsions be stronger than my values.
Now for clarity, the whole point of my post was the instant on the bridge. What i couldn't wrap my head around was the timing. She raised her head from her phone, saw me and instantly smiled. I don't know how she could have felt then, but i expected a first negative reaction, at least some fear or discomfort before she put up a defense mechanism...

I'm astounded at how some would kill me if they saw me rn, and some saw this as a potential start of romance or hookup.

304	Today I lied to my mom about how I'm doing in life	"As title. I'm in a bad place mentally. My own incompetence has led me next to financial ruin and I'll soon be homeless. Someone I dearly care about has effectively told me to kick rocks (should be clear these are separate issues) which breaks my heart. Over the last like 24hours I've gone and walked the line from suicidal ideation to actively making plans and arranging affairs for killing myself. I feel live even if I were to keep living I'd just repeat this process and its not worth it. The stress was making me bug out and I felt like I *needed* to speak to someone who I could voice my thoughts to.

So I called my mother. Who is completely unaware at my current state of affairs. She lives in a different city and I'm known for going radio silent for awhile so she's not aware of what going on in my life until I tell her what's happening. I didn't think about what I was gonna say when she picked up. So when she picked up and asked me how things were going my brain blanched. I couldn't tell my mother about all in my life. I couldn't just.... throw that stress on her. She's too loving and she's worked too hard her whole life explicitly for her family. She's getting closer to 60 and the stress of hearing all that would take years off her life. 

So I lied to her. I told her I was doing fine. In fact I told her I was working hard and just got a new apprenticeship. That things were looking good even though I had a lot of work in front of me. I checked on her and all confirmed she was okay and had a good week and we finished the call.   It hurt so bad to say and honestly I don't know that what I just did was any better than if I told her everything. Mind you I'm no saint. I'm not above lying in most situations. But I love my mom and I don't want her to worry that she missed all the signs and could have done something. 

I felt a lot better having a normal conversation with my mom. But I also feel the dissonance of lying to her to such a degree splitting my skull in half. Right now I'm just.... hollow. I feel like there's a lot I'm doing wrong but m maybe I can avoid lying to my mom.  Or maybe not.  Idk. But I needed to get this think off my chest. 

Edit: Adding my update comment to the main post

As an update I called her back. I didn't tell her everything. I couldn't tell her how close I was to killing myself. And I probably never will. I told her about my situation and I told her that I'm exhausted and my head is probably not in the best space. She told me I could always go back to the family home and that she was glad I came back and told her the truth. She also pushed for therapy again and I told her I'd go. I'm not keen on it. But at this point it's probably better than what I've been doing."	1bytf4q	today i lied to my mom about how im doing in life	"as title im in a bad place mentally my own incompetence has led me next to financial ruin and ill soon be homeless someone i dearly care about has effectively told me to kick rocks should be clear these are separate issues which breaks my heart over the last like hours ive gone and walked the line from suicidal ideation to actively making plans and arranging affairs for killing myself i feel live even if i were to keep living id just repeat this process and its not worth it the stress was making me bug out and i felt like i needed to speak to someone who i could voice my thoughts to

so i lied to her i told her i was doing fine in fact i told her i was working hard and just got a new apprenticeship that things were looking good even though i had a lot of work in front of me i checked on her and all confirmed she was okay and had a good week and we finished the call   it hurt so bad to say and honestly i dont know that what i just did was any better than if i told her everything mind you im no saint im not above lying in most situations but i love my mom and i dont want her to worry that she missed all the signs and could have done something 

i felt a lot better having a normal conversation with my mom but i also feel the dissonance of lying to her to such a degree splitting my skull in half right now im just hollow i feel like theres a lot im doing wrong but m maybe i can avoid lying to my mom  or maybe not  idk but i needed to get this think off my chest 

edit adding my update comment to the main post

as an update i called her back i didnt tell her everything i couldnt tell her how close i was to killing myself and i probably never will i told her about my situation and i told her that im exhausted and my head is probably not in the best space she told me i could always go back to the family home and that she was glad i came back and told her the truth she also pushed for therapy again and i told her id go im not keen on it but at this point its probably better than what ive been doing"	bytfq

306	I used to physically assault my sister when we were children. 	"Growing up I was regularly hit by my parents, left on the side of the road and my dad was always high or drunk. This context explains where my behaviour stemmed from, but it does not forgive it. I would chase her and beat her regularly, and I feel absolutely awful about it now. I know how much I made her life a living hell, and I wish I could fix it. I wish there was something I could do to go back in time and stop myself. This was from when I was first able to throw a punch till I was 13 and kicked out for the first time. 
Edit: my sister and I have a wonderful relationship now, 10 years on from this with a shared understanding of how fucked up our parents were. I am very grateful to be her maid of honor at her wedding next year, and amazed to see the beautiful person she's become.

311	I remembered I abused my pets as a kid and I can’t live with myself	"I’m shaking with stomach pains as I write this, but if I don’t share it now I might actually not survive. The guilt has gotten too unbearable. I’m not looking for sympathy because I don’t deserve it. I know this will get tons of hate and that is all deserved. I’m the worst type of person in the world and I don’t know how or why it happened but I can’t live with myself anymore.

When I was a kid, young enough to not know any better but old enough that I should’ve I guess, I abused my pets, one cat and one dog. I won’t sugarcoat it, I occasionally used them for sexual gratification. I’m female so there was was no penetration of any kind, but I essentially used the warmth of their body and rubbed up against them. This went on for I think roughly two years, mostly with the cat. And I’m fucking disgusted by it. I hate myself every second that goes by. 

I never, ever thought what I was doing was animal abuse. I loved animals and I still do. But for some reason I thought what I was doing was harmless and wouldn’t affect the animals at all, that it was weird but not bad. When I got older and learned that what I did was bestiality and that it is animal abuse, I felt my body start to reject itself in a sense. I honestly can’t tell you why I did it. I don’t think I was ever sexually attracted to them, just curious and lonely and sexually frustrated. I had/have intrusive thoughts and couldn’t make them stop and decided to act on them out of desperation. Looking back I also suspect previous sexual encounters as a child (I’m hesitant to say SA, as I have experienced that relatively recently, karma I suppose) may have contributed to my skewed understanding of sex, consent, and morals as a whole. But NONE of this is an excuse. I didn’t even really connect the pieces until this year. 

It doesn’t matter though. I can’t tell anyone, can’t apologize to the animals because it’s been so long. I was able to convince my parents to send the cat away when I got older and I can only hope she found a better, more loving family, but I blame myself endlessly for letting it get to that point. I think my recent SA has made these memories come out of hiding, or at least is making me face the music. Because no matter what happened to me, I deserved it. I deserve every bad thing that happened and is going to happen to me, because how much more disgusting, more dangerous, more horribly morally fucked up can you get? People tell me I’m kind and a good person and deserve to be happy but they have no idea what I’ve done and how wrong they are. I’ve disappointed everyone, lied to everyone about who I truly am. It doesn’t matter how remorseful I am, how different I am today and how long ago it was, I can’t go back and change it. I did it, I’ll have always done it, and that makes me want to die more than anything. The only reason I haven’t is because I’m too scared of death.

To anyone who has taken the time to read all this: thank you, and I’m sorry. I hate the thought of exposing people to this fucked up shit, but I’m lost. I can’t lose my therapist, other counselors are on a waitlist, I can’t go to confession because I’m not religious and if I told my friends or family, I would lose every single one of them, and I’m too much of a coward to lose more people I care about in my life. I’m just so fucking sorry…"	1bwqkzh	i remembered i abused my pets as a kid and i cant live with myself	"im shaking with stomach pains as i write this but if i dont share it now i might actually not survive the guilt has gotten too unbearable im not looking for sympathy because i dont deserve it i know this will get tons of hate and that is all deserved im the worst type of person in the world and i dont know how or why it happened but i cant live with myself anymore

312	I no called no showed a dentist office twice. And it’s biting me in the ass. 	"Recently, my wisdom teeth have become an issue. One top back one is basically crumbling in my mouth. Way back, about a year or two ago (before this tooth was ever an issue), I scheduled a dentist appointment because I hadn’t been to one in 1-2 years. I figured I should go. 

I also assumed my husband would go with me, but he had work. I’m scared of the dentist. Im *terrified* of the dentist. And the doctor. Anything healthcare related, I’m scared. He wasn’t interested in going, he said I was an adult, etc. So, I did the adult thing and chickened out. Instead of being a decent human being, I didn’t call and cancel because I didn’t want to know if they were going to be upset with me about canceling with such short notice. So I did what would make anyone upset and just didn’t show up. 

My teeth became an issue, so I called and made an appointment. Fingers crossed, maybe they wouldn’t remember I NCNS my last appointment. This was a year after the NCNS. I go in, alone again, and the receptionist tells me I’m on a list. So the dentist won’t see me that day, but I can reschedule. Awesome, I’m mortified. So embarrassed. I debated not rescheduling, but at the time, my tooth was bothering me. 

I didn’t go to that appointment. I chickened out because I figured everyone there would know me as the serial NCNS-er, and be angry at me. I don’t want angry people working on my teeth when I’m already terrified of being there, especially when I’m alone too. 

That brings us to what’s going on now. My back top wisdom tooth broke, I couldn’t ignore it. It’s stabbing and scratching my cheek and it’s broken. I ignored it for a month before it broke again and began stabbing my cheek. So it’s infected and painful. 

I went to a different dentist and they did X-rays. I need to go to an oral surgeon. They gave me a reference for an oral surgeon that’s in network for my insurance, but they’re about an hour away. My husband cannot legally drive, so that’s… a bummer. It’s gonna be impossible getting someone to drive us when I have my wisdom teeth taken out. I don’t have anyone that can do it, and he doesn’t know of anyone who would be willing to do that. And according to my husband, I 100% cannot drive after. Even if I’m not sedated or put to sleep. They 100% have to do either and I can’t drive after.  

So, he heard that the dentist office I NCNS will take wisdom teeth out. I don’t know why the dentist office I went to yesterday didn’t tell me about it. Not that I want to go, I very much want to avoid this place as much as possible. This place is about five minutes away from where I live. I’m willing to drive an hour to avoid it because I am so embarrassed. 

But I might have to go there and I don’t know if they’ll even be willing to schedule and work on me since I’ve done this twice. Serves me right, I got what I deserve for doing it. But damn. I’m even more scared of going.

313	My Dad Blames My Brother for the Car Crash, But It Was Me	"Hey Reddit,  
  
I've got to confess something that's been eating away at me for a while now. When I was 18, I crashed my dad's car. But here's the kicker – to this day, my dad thinks it was my brother.  
  
Let me set the scene for you. It was late at night, and I was out with some friends, cruising around town in my dad's car. I made a stupid mistake, took a turn too fast, and ended up crashing into a lamppost. Classic teenager move, right?  
  
But instead of owning up to it, I panicked and ran. I left the scene, hoping nobody would find out it was me. And you know what? They didn't. Instead, my dad found the wrecked car the next morning and immediately assumed it was my brother's doing.  
  
Now, my brother isn't exactly known for his stellar driving skills, so it wasn't much of a stretch for my dad to believe it was him. But deep down, I knew the truth, and the guilt has been eating away at me ever since.  
  
It's been two years, and my dad still blames my brother for the crash. Every time he brings it up, I can't help but feel like a total fraud. My brother doesn't deserve to take the fall for my mistake, but I've been too much of a coward to come clean.  
  
So, why am I telling you all this? Because I can't keep living with this lie weighing me down. My brother doesn't deserve to be blamed for something he didn't do, and my dad deserves to know the truth – even if it means facing the consequences of my actions.  
  
To my dad, if you ever read this (which I doubt), I'm sorry. I'm sorry for lying to you and letting you believe that my brother was responsible for the crash. And to my brother, I'm sorry for letting you take the fall for my mistake. You deserve better.  
  
Thanks for listening, Reddit. It feels good to finally get this off my chest.

314	I sexually assaulted a woman on a night out and now feel terrible several years later.	"This is something that has been heavily weighing on my mind for the past couple weeks. I simply forgot about it but am now coming to terms with how gross and disgusting my actions were that night. For reference I was 25 at the time. I also apologize if I seem to ramble on in the story, Just trying to get all my thoughts out.

A couple years ago some buddies invited me to go out drinking with them, and while I am not a heavy drinker nor enjoy the ""nightlife"" at all, I decided to be open to something new and get out of the house. At first I'm not really enjoying myself, but as the night progresses and the drinks flow even an introvert like myself will become social.

At some point I bump into a mutual friend of a friend, let's call her Sam. She's a couple years older than me and we've always had pleasant interactions in the past. I never thought twice about her since she lived in the next town over, but tonight we're really vibing and there's some light flirting going on. I end up hanging out with her and her friend group for the next hour. She buys me drinks. I buy her drinks. We're just having fun and everything's going great. Eventually everyone starts heading home and she invites me to hang out and stay at her place for the night, which I happily accept.

Once at her house she turns on some music and we continue our conversation over glasses of wine. Honestly, I'm not expecting anything at this point. I'm really just enjoying her company and we end up really connecting over the same music artist we like. I also haven't had much experience with girls and am still a virgin, so I decide to take things slow and let her make any moves (that said, I'm thoroughly drunk by this point and my memory of that night is a little hazy, but deep down there's no doubt how I wanted the night to end). After 30 minutes or so she suggests we watch a movie and we move to the couch.

Let me preface this by saying we haven't kissed or done much touching throughout the the whole night. About 10 minutes in I decide to move closer and put my arm around her. I'm generally a very passive person, but in my drunken state I figure fuck it, let's actually make a move.  She leans into me a bit, so I decide to go in for a kiss. I mean there's just no way she isn't somewhat interested in me right? Surely all the signs were there (turns out everything is a sign when you haven't been in a relationship and a girl is being nice to you). Instead, she pulls back, tells me she thinks I'm cute but she isn't into me like that. Ok fine, I'm a little confused and hurt, but we go back to watching the movie. She really was just being nice and we were just connecting as friends. That should be great. No harm, no foul.

Except not. My mind is spinning from the alcohol, and I can't tell up from down. I still have my arm around her, and for some fucking reason, move my hand lower to her thigh, then slowly to her inner thigh, and then continue up. I don't know what I was thinking. She rejected my advances once, so obviously this is NOT okay. She's frozen this whole time, and then shouts ""NO"" before my hand goes all the way. I move away from her on the couch, and after an awkward silence, I profusely apologize and blame the alcohol. She says it's okay (obviously it's not) and she goes to bed while I stay on the couch.

As you can imagine the next morning was extremely awkward. I break the silence and again apologize for my actions, again blaming the alcohol, which while impacted my decision making, is no excuse for what I did. She again said it was okay and that she wouldn't tell any of our friend groups what happened. I left and that was that. We haven't seen or spoken to each other since.

I quickly forgot about that night and moved on with my life, thinking I'm an honorable and good human being and trying to live my life accordingly. But I'm not. Deep down everyone has evil lurking, and I witnessed mine. I read stories about rape and sexual assault on reddit all the time, and it's so easy to judge those people from behind a computer screen and think ""I would never do that"", or ""I would do x and y differently"".  These past few weeks I've been doing some soul searching and needed to get this all out. I don't drink anymore, if that means anything. I feel like shit, even if it happened years ago. As far as I know Sam hasn't told anyone about that night. I'm debating if I should I reach out to her and really explain how fucked up it was and really apologize that yes, I sexually assaulted her. But maybe this would hurt her more. I don't know. I guess that's it for now.

&#x200B;

EDIT: There seems to be differing definitions of ""sexual assault"", and I don't need people commenting that I did nothing wrong, or that she said ""it's okay"" after, or that her not saying anything leading up to the act is consent. Please see the following definition and do with it what you will: [rainn.org](https://www.rainn.org/articles/sexual-assault#:~:text=The%20term%20sexual%20assault%20refers,or%20penetrating%20the%20perpetrator's%20body). Note the term ""explicit consent"".

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I appreciate the many comments from everyone, including DMs from people who've both been a victim and perpetrator of SA. I wasn't looking for any justifications for what I did. I was a horrible person and know it, and likely still carry a bit of that inside me which I will have to deal with for the rest of my life. I mostly was just venting and needed a place to get this story out, but lots of people ended up giving great advice along the way.

General consensus seems to be that I absolutely should never contact her again, as the risk of further trauma and pain to her is likely, and it would just be to make myself feel better. I can only hope she heals and gets the support she needs, and I don't deserve her forgiveness. It sounds like professional help in therapy may also benefit me and help me grow, even if it's just a couple sessions to reaffirm what I need to do. I will also never get drunk again, especially around women, which is basically a given if I want to be better.

This has been an eye opening experience into understanding myself, and I hope no one makes the same mistake I did, which isn't necessarily about sexual assault. You should already know SA is bad and never do it. I mean doing things you never thought in a million years you would do, whether under the influence of any drug or not, or under any extenuating circumstances. Learn who you are to the core of your being, both the good and bad. I promise you one day the bad impulses might take over in an irreparable way, and you will be shocked and recoil from yourself. It doesn't matter how easy it is for you to say otherwise and pretend you have it all figured out. I was that person too.

Always do the right thing by yourself and others."	1bw4pqc	i sexually assaulted a woman on a night out and now feel terrible several years later	"this is something that has been heavily weighing on my mind for the past couple weeks i simply forgot about it but am now coming to terms with how gross and disgusting my actions were that night for reference i was  at the time i also apologize if i seem to ramble on in the story just trying to get all my thoughts out

except not my mind is spinning from the alcohol and i cant tell up from down i still have my arm around her and for some fucking reason move my hand lower to her thigh then slowly to her inner thigh and then continue up i dont know what i was thinking she rejected my advances once so obviously this is not okay shes frozen this whole time and then shouts no before my hand goes all the way i move away from her on the couch and after an awkward silence i profusely apologize and blame the alcohol she says its okay obviously its not and she goes to bed while i stay on the couch

as you can imagine the next morning was extremely awkward i break the silence and again apologize for my actions again blaming the alcohol which while impacted my decision making is no excuse for what i did she again said it was okay and that she wouldnt tell any of our friend groups what happened i left and that was that we havent seen or spoken to each other since

i quickly forgot about that night and moved on with my life thinking im an honorable and good human being and trying to live my life accordingly but im not deep down everyone has evil lurking and i witnessed mine i read stories about rape and sexual assault on reddit all the time and its so easy to judge those people from behind a computer screen and think i would never do that or i would do x and y differently  these past few weeks ive been doing some soul searching and needed to get this all out i dont drink anymore if that means anything i feel like shit even if it happened years ago as far as i know sam hasnt told anyone about that night im debating if i should i reach out to her and really explain how fucked up it was and really apologize that yes i sexually assaulted her but maybe this would hurt her more i dont know i guess thats it for now

xb

edit there seems to be differing definitions of sexual assault and i dont need people commenting that i did nothing wrong or that she said its okay after or that her not saying anything leading up to the act is consent please see the following definition and do with it what you will rainnorg note the term explicit consent

xb

edit  i appreciate the many comments from everyone including dms from people whove both been a victim and perpetrator of sa i wasnt looking for any justifications for what i did i was a horrible person and know it and likely still carry a bit of that inside me which i will have to deal with for the rest of my life i mostly was just venting and needed a place to get this story out but lots of people ended up giving great advice along the way

general consensus seems to be that i absolutely should never contact her again as the risk of further trauma and pain to her is likely and it would just be to make myself feel better i can only hope she heals and gets the support she needs and i dont deserve her forgiveness it sounds like professional help in therapy may also benefit me and help me grow even if its just a couple sessions to reaffirm what i need to do i will also never get drunk again especially around women which is basically a given if i want to be better

this has been an eye opening experience into understanding myself and i hope no one makes the same mistake i did which isnt necessarily about sexual assault you should already know sa is bad and never do it i mean doing things you never thought in a million years you would do whether under the influence of any drug or not or under any extenuating circumstances learn who you are to the core of your being both the good and bad i promise you one day the bad impulses might take over in an irreparable way and you will be shocked and recoil from yourself it doesnt matter how easy it is for you to say otherwise and pretend you have it all figured out i was that person too

315	I'm a registered nurse and I used to have Munchausen syndrome (aka factitious disorder).	"**I'm a registered nurse.** I started doing this when I was in nursing school. I stopped when we started clinicals.

I actually posted this here once before but took it down since the comment section turned into a dumpster fire of hate. I'm reposting because it might give you some insight into the mind of someone who has FD. I also just want to get it off my chest.

**If you're curious about anything, you can ask it in the comments.** As long as you're polite and don't ask anything too personal, I will try to answer.

I don't think I have FD anymore. In the last three years, I have only been to the doctor 5 times. Three were just me being responsible and getting my annual checkup and the other two were for legit issues. Before that, I was a professional patient. I'd be at the doctor's at least once a month with made-up symptoms. If I couldn't see my PCP, I would go to urgent care or even the ER. I faked symptoms and knew just what to say so they'd take me seriously, not too much that they'd know I'm lying.

**How did I pay for all this?**

My insurance covered it. I never had to pay more than a $10 co-pay. I did my homework to make sure I wouldn't get hit with any nasty surprises after-the-fact. Well, except this one time something weird happened and I had to pay an ""affiliate"" for x-rays (even though it was in the same hospital). I had a $30 bill for that.

The only advice I can give you from this hot mess is to know your insurance policy like the back of your hand. Start reading it today. They usually have people who can help you understand it. Take notes. Trust me, you don’t wanna be learning the hard way and end up with bills that make you wanna cry.

**WHY DID I DO THIS?**

For the thrills, babes. It felt like a free trip to the theme park. First, medical stuff has always felt cool to me (hence, the career I chose). Second, I was just really immature. Immature young adults do immature things. Some people speed down the highway thinking they're in ""Fast & Furious."" I was over here getting my kicks from playing patient.

**Did they ever catch on?**

I really doubt it. Now that I'm a nurse with some miles on me, I honestly don't think I could spot someone pulling the stunts I did. Sure, I've seen patients try to pull one over on us, but it's not always black and white. Sometimes it's super obvious, and other times it's just a little sus. Most of the time, we give our patients the benefit of the doubt because they don't have a reason to lie. I was never overly dramatic, and I never wanted way too much treatment. I don't think they suspected anything from me.

The real FD alarms go off when the patient's a frequent flier in the hospital with no clear diagnosis, or when someone's a regular in the ER that all the staff recognize. That's not how I did it. I made sure never to overplay my hand, never got too familiar with any one ER. The one time they wanted to admit me, I refused. That felt like the opposite of what someone with FD would do.

I think way more people with FD are probably flying under the radar because they're not going full soap opera with their symptoms.

**WHAT CHANGED?**

I grew up. Working in a hospital and seeing how insanely busy everyone is was a real eye-opener. I already knew it was hectic, but I didn't truly get it until I worked on the other side. I saw nurses barely having time for a bathroom break. I understood my behavior was causing real harm and stopped.

**I don't think it's any deeper than that**

I know everyone loves a good backstory, like some deep-rooted trauma that was the root cause of my antics. I don't think my case was like that. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, like Freud said. For me, it was just a weird phase, an immature hobby that I outgrew. That's it. I wasn't trying to fill some emotional void or anything.

One more thing. I barely have enough free time to watch my favorite shows anymore, let alone indulge in any other hobbies. Back then, I had way too much free time, and you know what they say about idle hands.

**DID I EVER GET TREATMENT FOR FD?**

No. When I was doing this, I didn't want to stop or get help. When I stopped, I didn't get treatment because I didn't think I'd need it anymore. And now that I’ve got my stuff together, I don't want ""Factitious Disorder"" stamped on my medical records. If it ever happens again, I will get help, but it won't happen again.

With FD, it's not like you're delusional. You know you're faking it. I managed to leave it in the past, but if it ever makes a comeback, I'll be getting a therapy session booked ASAP.

**Pro tip for my fellow health pros**

We could totally notice more patients with FD if we kept an eye out for the red flags. If someone's only sick on weekends and holidays, you should notice that pattern. And I think we should pay more attention to medical records. A little detective work might not just spot FD, but also catch a bunch of other shady stuff going on."	1bvy48d	im a registered nurse and i used to have munchausen syndrome aka factitious disorder	"im a registered nurse i started doing this when i was in nursing school i stopped when we started clinicals

316	Always been lying to parents to hangout with friends 	"So I'm 26 and extrovert. I like to make friends and hangout with people. My parents being bit of orthodox, they wanted to know that whom I'm hanging out and I'm not doing anything wrong. So earlier I used to tell them that I met this girl from college or I met few guys on ground and we are good buddies - something like that. So my parents didn't allow much in the earlier days, telling me to focus on studies. Later on, I realised that if I didn't lie to parents, I'll miss fun in college life or I cannot hangout with friends. 
So today even, like after 5 yrs passing from college, sometimes that feeling gives me bit of guilt that I used to lie to my parents, just to hangout. Now, if I come across some situation where I've to lie, I apologise to them in my mind only and proceed for that thing. It doesn't make much impact, but just let me feel bit lighter."	1bvtymq	always been lying to parents to hangout with friends 	"so im  and extrovert i like to make friends and hangout with people my parents being bit of orthodox they wanted to know that whom im hanging out and im not doing anything wrong so earlier i used to tell them that i met this girl from college or i met few guys on ground and we are good buddies  something like that so my parents didnt allow much in the earlier days telling me to focus on studies later on i realised that if i didnt lie to parents ill miss fun in college life or i cannot hangout with friends

317	I stole two books from my school’s local library and i haven’t returned them for months…	"I’m in JHS and I was browsing on the shelves in the STEM section one day because I wanted to do research purposes related to it, since it’s my top #1 strand for marine biology.

I stumbled upon two interesting books that caught my attention, they were just silly fun facts about animals and biology but I enjoyed reading them. 

So I searched them up online in hopes I could buy and afford a copy, but I was way out of budget and they only had 1/2 in stock.

I acted on my impulsive thoughts instead of borrowing them, I was reading on a corner, surrounded by bookshelves with no witnesses and CCTV cameras.

I stuffed the two books inside my messenger bag cautiously before leaving the school grounds immediately. (for context: I did not skip, It was dismissal time already and I’m a commuter)

Months have passed by and the books are still in my possession, just chilling on top of my study table, knowing that it has my school’s logo stamped on the back. 

I do feel a sense of guilt every time I read them all over again, the SY is near to an end and I’m honestly surprised that I haven’t been caught just yet.

318	I let a bullied classmate take the fall for something I did	When I was 9 years old, we had a male cat that marked his territory everywhere. By the time I realized he did it my book bag, it was too late. I was already in class and that potent, cloying smell filled the classroom. Some of my classmates assumed it was the “weird” girl they didn’t like, and picked on her mercilessly, while I sat there and said nothing. I was a child, but I still feel terrible 40 years later. 	1bvnbf8	i let a bullied classmate take the fall for something i did	when i was  years old we had a male cat that marked his territory everywhere by the time i realized he did it my book bag it was too late i was already in class and that potent cloying smell filled the classroom some of my classmates assumed it was the weird girl they didnt like and picked on her mercilessly while i sat there and said nothing i was a child but i still feel terrible  years later 	bvnbf
319	Told people I got hit by a car but I actually ran myself over 	"I was out to dinner with my friends and one of them asked for an adderall. I keep it in my car so I excused myself and went out to the parking lot. I’d already been drinking as we’d gone to the winery first and I was still having wine. I get in the car, open the bottle to get one and spilled them everywhere, including on the asphalt (the car door was open cause I expected to quickly be in and out)
The parking lot has no lights so I decided to turn my car on and back up a little then use the headlights to find the pills (my phone was inside and I was drunk so this made sense to me at the time ). I put the car in park (found out very quickly I actually left it in neutral) and then got on the ground to look for pills. Car started rolling back and I get up to chase after it.  It looked like a scene from Mr Beans Holiday. I get around the door and manage to put one foot in, I’m trying to stomp on the break when I somehow tumble out the car and end up underneath it. My 2900 pound suv rolled over the back of my left leg. I was so drunk I hadn’t even processed what just happened and I got back up to keep chasing after it. It slowly backed into another vehicle and finally stopped. 

Nobody was outside or saw me. I drove to a different parking spot, and went inside and told my friends we need to get the check. They said I looked disheveled and asked me what happened. I said someone hit me with their car and they demanded security footage and to “find out who did this to you!”. Luckily there is none and they don’t know that I’m both the victim and main suspect in my own hit and run. 

Before you ask, yes, the next day I went to the ER to get checked out. No broken bones but I did get a bad muscle injury so doctor monitored my CPK levels (which were double what they should be) and he also thinks I should press charges on whoever ran me over 😬 "	1bv998u	told people i got hit by a car but i actually ran myself over 	"i was out to dinner with my friends and one of them asked for an adderall i keep it in my car so i excused myself and went out to the parking lot id already been drinking as wed gone to the winery first and i was still having wine i get in the car open the bottle to get one and spilled them everywhere including on the asphalt the car door was open cause i expected to quickly be in and out

324	I called my mom ugly and it's my biggest regret to this day	"I can't remember how old I was but probably between 5-8 years old. My mom was on sick leave because she had been burnt out. It was me, my older sister and my mom at home. We were all watching TV, kinda crammed up in our small couch. My mom was laying on her side and me and my sister were sitting next to each other. I looked at my mom and asked her if she wasn't wearing makeup. She said no and I regretfully remember that I thought I was being funny when I replied with ""you look so ugly"". I also remember with horror that my mom started crying. She wasn't mad, she didn't say anything, she just cried silently. I looked at my sister and she kind of shook her head at me as if saying ""no, you can't say that"". This is the worst memory of my life. I hate myself every time it comes to mind. I wish I could erase this from my memory. 

Context: When I was a kid I was very shy and sometimes didn't speak to people at all. I kind of struggled around people and just how to fit in/act normal. I was a ""good kid"" but I had a lot of anxiety at a very early age and was also very sensitive. I would say or do things that I picked up from my piers because I thought that was normal or even cool. Then I would get in trouble and people were disappointed in me and I would feel really bad. Why could I never get things right? Is there something wrong with me? I just struggled a lot with how to be a human.

326	Stole from my 2nd grade teacher more than one time.	"6 years ago I was an annoying little 2nd grader. My 3rd grade teacher, Mrs. F, was a really sweet teacher. She had pencils that smelled of fruit on her desk one day. Noone was looking and I put them in my backpack. She didn't realize they were missing, if she did she didn't say anything. A little letter I took a cinnamon scented pencil. This was a not so cheat pencil. She confronted the whole class about it but I never got in trouble.

327	I used to steal little things from other people when I was younger. 	"I had all the makings of a little kleptomaniac but thankfully I grew out of it.

I would steal small toys or jewelry when I was over at friends’ houses. I would steal little things from students in my classroom like their fun erasers, any little toys they would bring, or other small items like crafting supplies or mementoes. I even stole an apple shaped eraser from a book fair. I remember taking a pendant from a friend that had pressed flowers in it. I remember taking a popper toy from a student in my classroom and the teacher even had this student make an announcement in front of the class about it missing to see if anyone has found it. I had it in my possession when that announcement was made.

I don’t know why I did it. It wasn’t even really because I wanted the items. It was mostly because I just wanted to perform the act of taking the items. 

As I said, I grew out of it. This all happened probably under the age of 10. Not sure why I had to do it but I guess I’m glad the compulsion didn’t persist or turn into something worse.

331	I've been a terrible friend and family member for most of my adult life. 	"I'd never really had depression until I became an adult, but it got bad FAST. At 21, I went through an abusive relationship and my partner drugged me with some botched acid tabs, which sent me into psychedelic psychosis for several months and my depression became much worse. Some of the effects seem to be permanent such as loss of memory and brain function; I really miss how smart I used to be :( After that I was SA'd and some repressed memories of being SA'd in high school came up too, so I kinda dealt with both of them at once. All my friends moved away so I had to live with people I didn't know or trust during college, and the living conditions ended up being very chaotic and dangerous. None of my family lived near me. I was in college studying a difficult degree I had no interest in, it just sounded practical. When I wasn't home, I was working long hours in an extremely toxic work environment that I won't even go into, but TLDR the place should've been shut down for many reasons such as labor law violations, sexual harassment, understaffing yada yada yada. 
The stress eventually gave me stomach ulcers which made me feel sick or in pain 24/7, unable to eat which caused fatigue and rapid weight loss, and obviously worse depression. The symptoms always got worse after I experienced high stress, so when I was stressed I was also in great pain and discomfort, which caused more stress, and it was just a hellish cycle. No treatments worked and doctors told me it wouldn't get better unless I got my stress under control. Mountains of medical bills just to inevitably get that advice. Started self harming everyday instead. 

I got to that point of depression where you just lose interest in EVERYTHING, even the things you once adored. I started half assing everything in my life because I didn't have passion anymore and tbh thought I'd kill myself soon anyways. My best friend of 15 years got engaged and I was the maid of honor; my absolute dream. But I barely thought about it, barely put any effort into the bachelorette party, during the huge wedding only 2 people did speeches and I was one of them. I wrote the speech the day before and it sucked. I made one joke and made cliche generalisations about the bride and groom being perfect for each other. 

My mom lived a couple hours away and completed what was basically a beginners triathlon - but she was almost 60 years old! It was a huge event and the whole family attended, except me. I was a wage slave who couldn't get that weekend off from my shitty job, so I didn't show up. I barely ever called my parents and put no interest into my relationship with them, even though they're AMAZING parents. Same with my brother and sister. I missed my brother's military graduation for the same dumb reason. My siblings have always been huge role models and supporters to me and I barely reached out to them during all of college. I'm crying just typing this. 

This is how I treated every friendship and family member during those times. After years of therapy and self healing, my head is FINALLY clear and I feel like my actual self again. I can't believe it. 

If I could go back in time, I'd absolutely spoil my best friend throughout her whole engagement, write the most passionate wedding speech to celebrate her and her husbands achievements and love, include some stories. I'd quit my job just so I could attend every family members event and talk to them everyday. I'd treat every friendship with passion and speak my mind instead of withdrawing. 

I've never told my family about anything i went through, partly because of shame but mostly because it would devastate them and I can't bear to do that. But as a result it feels like they don't understand me anymore, and I've felt like the odd one out for a while. They're very close to each other but when I'm with them I feel so out of place, like I'm just kinda....there. now I get such bad anxiety when I'm with them it's painful just to be around them. 

I hate the person I've been since I became an adult. I'm so grateful to be better now, and I'm committed to being a better person. People around me have noticed the difference. But I grieve the once in a lifetime moments with my loved ones that I wasted because of my shitty mental state. I barely remember those times now because I was so out of it during. 

Anyone else struggle with forgiving themselves for the way they acted when they were low?

332	I never paid for my patio set, and the store associate loaded it into my car and my MIL car for us. 	"Back in the day when me and my husband just married, I was looking for a patio set. I went to a big box store and found a set on clearance as it was end of season and open box. I asked if they could hold it for me as I needed my husband to be off work so he could pick it up in his truck. They said no. So I asked if I could make multiple trips and the inside store associate said yes. So I grabbed the  big clearance sign and went off to pay.

I went to customer service to pay. The person was on the phone. I placed the sign on the counter in front of them. They walked to a different part of the customer service desk. I followed them and stood in front of them. They moved back to where they were originally standing. I followed them there. And crickets, I just wasn't acknowledged by the customer service person. They looked at me and then avoided me.

As I was standing there, still waiting to pay, the inside store associate said let's load it up. I thought f**k it and would go pay when they asked for the bill. Well as they were loading up my car, I saw my MIL there and we loaded her car. We drove to her house to drop it off as she lived close to the store. Then I drove back and picked up the rest of it and they helped me load that up as well. 

Not once was I asked if I paid for it. I truly did try, but got irritated the CS person didn't even want to speak to me. That is how I got my patio set, many a year ago. It is older than my child and it should be replaced, but it didn't cost me anything, so I am not letting it go till it truly gets gross, then I will save it for my dog so they have a place to lay on it in the summer.

335	I became rich by selling adopts for more than I bought them for	"Edit : thank you everyone for your honest responses. I have decided that I’m going to keep doing that since both parties benefit from it. 

I became rich by selling characters for more then I bought them for

For any people unaware what characters I am talking about — there is a culture in art community of drawing images of creatures that you made up and later selling them, which is called an adopt. 

So, how exactly did I become rich? I am from a relatively poor country with dogwater of a currency, where 10 USD could feed you well for a week. Therefore, there are a lot of people selling high quality pieces that they spent 10+ hours working on for measly 1 dollar or so. 

However, in international spaces, due to the inflation of USD the price for even the lowest quality adopts from noname artists varies between 10-50 USD. For relatively popular ones it only goes up.

So, as you might have guessed, I just buy those HQ characters for cents and then resell them for what would be considered big money in my country. And even if I were selling them for lowbal in the US, I would still be making profit either way.

Usually there are TOS to characters, like «don’t sell for more than bought unless spent money on art», «notify about the new owner» and etc. I avoid those because I don’t care for those characters besides reselling them for more than I bought them for. 

I really feel sorry for those designers as they most likely could get a lot of money if they just learnt English and made a toyhouse/ychcom/etc account, but capitalism is a game with survival of the fittest.

Something feels deeply broken in my life, but I shouldn’t author texts or tell people so many twisted statements about how the world ought have more of what it’s been getting.  I may have lost my care of what happens but broadcasting it is not the way.  I shouldn’t curse people.  

I should do my part to contribute instead.  I simply feel like old paths were ripped from out beneath me, and I’ve been rebuilding.  I feel far behind in life, and it’s beyond jealousy of peers, I just want stability and authenticity in what I do and for there to be reward in life for innovation individuals can manage so we can all be a little more relaxed and artful about how we live.

I deeply want to get back to positivity.  There are so many things to be positive for!  I just feel ashamed for some of things I’ve said.  I think they were if conveyed in person clearly intended to suggest a mockery of what has gone on.  Some of my statements I do sincerely believe but the way I expressed everything was well over the top, too much, and needlessly without civility of expressing some really twisted ideas.  There might be legitimate claims in what I said but what I said was in passionate fiery anger for feeling so repeatedly screwed over the last 6 months.

I’ve been given so much already, this is a period of having less for me.  I am gonna just smile, try to think friendlier thoughts, be at ease, think more before speaking or writing.

We’re talking a guy who left me without desperately needed $16k during holidays without diligent apology and to repay.  A woman who wanted my kids also took money from me because she had me sign on a lease for her that I didn’t want.  She then said some foul things against me and I had to leave.

And this is sad and all but not worth the things I said.  I do keep getting screwed but I just have to keep holding out there is gonna be a job for me here soon.  I am gonna do more internal work first before externalizing garbage from my mouth and in things I communicate.

Couldn’t be more sorry.  Apologies 🙏🏻

347	I used to frequently steal from lockers in high school	In my freshman year of high school, people would put a pencil in their locker when they didn’t want to put the combination in so often. I used to open peoples lockers and take food, homework, or even just random things like pencils just so somebody would be sad. One day I took a students cell phone and hid it all the way across the school (mind you, i went to a big ass school) and he never found it. I feel so bad because if my phone was stolen from my locker, I’d be incredibly distraught, but the fact that i got away with it fuels me sometimes. 	1bldw89	i used to frequently steal from lockers in high school	in my freshman year of high school people would put a pencil in their locker when they didnt want to put the combination in so often i used to open peoples lockers and take food homework or even just random things like pencils just so somebody would be sad one day i took a students cell phone and hid it all the way across the school mind you i went to a big ass school and he never found it i feel so bad because if my phone was stolen from my locker id be incredibly distraught but the fact that i got away with it fuels me sometimes 	bldw

(Update) Omg I wasn't expecting people to actually relate or even tell me it was okay. Y'all made me day istg.

349	I’ve lied again to my parents about college for the past two semesters.  	" I signed up for classes and my parents have been
 paying for them for the last two semesters. They think I’ve been going to my classes and getting decent grades due to me lying whenever they ask about it and making them believe in a completely false reality.

 I have withdrawn from every class the last two semesters (with no refund) and their money has gone completely down the drain because of me. My parents would’ve been more understanding if I was honest from the beginning but now I feel like I’m in too deep.

 I know this all is pathetic, but I just want to take the easy route and run away and lose contact. I don’t know why I can’t bring myself to talk to my parents. I don’t know what to do. 

I legitimately don’t have any excuses for myself and my behavior. I can’t put any blame on anxiety or depression. I’ve been feeling pretty well for the past year of pushing guilt aside and only caring about short-term happiness. 

It’s not even the first time I’ve done this. When I first went to college when I was 17 I also failed some classes one semester. And a year later I failed all my classes. They found out those times and did what they could to help. Which included some very expensive therapy. However, this is the third time I’ve done this and the third time I was dishonest to my parents and I believe it’s unforgivable. 

I know I need to come clean about this, but I want to take an easy way out again. I want to start using harder drugs, so I at least have some sort of reason for being terrible. I don’t know what to do. 

Edit:

Thank you for all of your comments. It was hard to stomach reading most of them and to come to terms with the shame I’ve been feeling. Hearing your guys advice was extremely helpful and gave me a lot of courage to finally call my mom and come clean to her about all the lying and the betraying I’ve done to her. I think things are going to be okay. I know it will take a long time to deserve her forgiveness and trust again but I am hopeful I can change. My plan now is to go back home for a bit, work, and then try to enlist in the military to learn discipline and have gratitude for all that I have been given. I know I will spend a long time feeling terribly guilty and an equally long time trying to make it up to my parents.

351	Stole someone legos out of their locker in 4th grade 	Ohh 2010 i was just bad during those times took 20$ from my dad and when he came to the school to get it from me i gave it away to some random kid in the bathroom, cause i thought it was save me from the troubles. But anyway i felt justified cause we were in the bathroom and he was just flexing his legos and wouldn’t let me touch them but talk how mighty they are, like we were kids i was letting him play with my bakugans and you turn around and do this to me??? So i waited from him to leave the bathroom and watch him put it in his locker then walk to his class, i then walked out straight towards his locker opened it, saw it sitting on the base of the locker grabbed then closed it. BROO why is his class a straight shot view of the lockers he literally saw me. Then saw him he raised his hands and i can see him mouthing what just happened, i jetted diagonally to my class and threw them away lol if all went to plan I would’ve kept them but after they came to my class and didn’t find them on me i was to scared to reach in the trash for them and by then too much trash was on it, that was our last interaction i can remember lol	1bkazk1	stole someone legos out of their locker in th grade 	ohh  i was just bad during those times took  from my dad and when he came to the school to get it from me i gave it away to some random kid in the bathroom cause i thought it was save me from the troubles but anyway i felt justified cause we were in the bathroom and he was just flexing his legos and wouldnt let me touch them but talk how mighty they are like we were kids i was letting him play with my bakugans and you turn around and do this to me so i waited from him to leave the bathroom and watch him put it in his locker then walk to his class i then walked out straight towards his locker opened it saw it sitting on the base of the locker grabbed then closed it broo why is his class a straight shot view of the lockers he literally saw me then saw him he raised his hands and i can see him mouthing what just happened i jetted diagonally to my class and threw them away lol if all went to plan i wouldve kept them but after they came to my class and didnt find them on me i was to scared to reach in the trash for them and by then too much trash was on it that was our last interaction i can remember lol	bkazk
352	I was such the liar and thief as a kid and teenager	"I lied a lot as a kid. My father died when I was young and my mother, albeit mentally unwell was quite chaste and honest. We were very poor. So I misbehaved and then lied about it. I stole money from her, from our housekeeper (more like an IHSS worker) and influenced my best friend to steal from her mother (then got caught). I once changed prices on an item in a store and the clerk discovered it and my mother was not a happy camper. I had an old radio with bulbs so I put my thermometer on one and conjured up a fever to get out of school; she was nurse! I wrote about it in a diary that had no lock on it. She read it and believed that I wrote it because I knew she'd read it. She was naive.

I stole cigarettes from my aunts who smoked at the time, a little piece of jewelry from my cousin (that I'm not sure she even knew was missing). I stole pills from my cousin's medicine cabinet and shared them with my friends. I stole clothes from stores and of course, my girlfriends all ""gave it to me"". I even lied to my girlfriends that I had my period a year before I actually did!

Although this is something I grew out of and had an old boyfriend who was a pathological fabricator, my life is so fantastical, I have no need to make stuff up anymore. I cannot stand a liar! I don't steal since then but do feel guilty when I walk through a store and feel like I want to take something and the guards eyeball me like they know."	1bjklgu	i was such the liar and thief as a kid and teenager	"i lied a lot as a kid my father died when i was young and my mother albeit mentally unwell was quite chaste and honest we were very poor so i misbehaved and then lied about it i stole money from her from our housekeeper more like an ihss worker and influenced my best friend to steal from her mother then got caught i once changed prices on an item in a store and the clerk discovered it and my mother was not a happy camper i had an old radio with bulbs so i put my thermometer on one and conjured up a fever to get out of school she was nurse i wrote about it in a diary that had no lock on it she read it and believed that i wrote it because i knew shed read it she was naive

353	i used to try to poison people when i was a little kid	"When i was between 7-9 years old we had a housemaid that used to bother me so i used to put a tiny bit of cleaning disinfectant in her empty water cup, thinking she’d fill the cup up with water and drink it without noticing. 

One time she told my parents that her stomach hurt and that she drank the disinfectant (i’m assuming she saw me put it in or something) and they told me to stop doing that because i could go to prison so i just stopped. 

Just wanted to tell someone.

Yeah thats the whole story even if i wanted to tell her i could we’ve lost contact with each other.

355	My Mom fired our House maid because of some money i took	"Im 19M five years ago our house maid got kicked out because of me and i regret it  
One day i came back from school  with couple of my friends then we decided to rent a PS4 for that day so i needed some money my dad wasn’t home and my mother was sleeping so i looked under one of the carpets and found some money (my mom kept it there it was more than i needed but said lets just take it and buy some extra stuff with it and was planning on telling mom when i get back) so when i finished playing i went back home and found my mom yelling at the maid and when i realised it was about the money i couldn’t say it was me because she would’ve killed me(bc why didn’t you tell me before i yelled at the poor maid…) so she kicked her out (the maid really needed that job and her family too) … now after five years i still visit her family and bring them food to help them and haven’t told anyone yet.

edit:  
i should've clarified that my mom never told anyone(like putting she's a thief or something on her file) she got a new job and im still a friend with their family and always trying to help them and everybody moved on and forgot about it so i don't think telling my mom is gonna change anything... am i right or what idk anymore.

another EDIT:  
the money wasnt that much its like 30$-40$ my mom didnt kick her out because of the amount she dosent care about it its about the concept of ""steeling"" (i think she put it under the carpet for special use because she dosent usually keep cash)

another one:  
one of the reasons for still not telling anyone is that before the pandemic i used to to be a bad student and stuff but since then i changed my life in every section and my family is finally proud and i think by saying this story its gonna bring me back

MORE CONTEXT:  
Thnx everybody for your opinions but im gonna give more context  
first of all i'm not an american (if u can't see it from my english) ... so where am from having a maid doesn't mean necessarily that ure rich or something... so im not some rich boy... i live a normal life 

and about the money and the amount (some ppl said i probably faked the amount and what i did with it like buying drugs or something) i converted the amount to dollars from my local currency thats why its sound small and drugs and drinking isn't that popular in my region so no i did not buy drugs i rented a PS4 and YES we do rent them here

and for ppl who said my mom shouldn't go the maid directly for the money is because the maid used to take foods and some clothes without telling us but never money or something like that my mother never told her anything bc she  obviously needed so OK 

when the maid left us she just went for another family like nothing happened. "	1bj9n4z	my mom fired our house maid because of some money i took	"im m five years ago our house maid got kicked out because of me and i regret it

356	I talked about my best friend's behaviour with other people	"I know it doesn't sounds as much but I think I did really bad. In short, during last year's summer break, my best friend renewed contact with his old friend and started to act really mean towards me even though I asked him to stop, I started to tell my other 2 friends about his behaviour, not to make him look bad in front of them (they also are friends with him), but because these were the only people that would help me to calm down or let me know how to act in this situation.

Fast forward to back to school and my best friend found out I talked about him, of course he was mad and I cried and begged him to forgive me because I was really emotional back then and I didn't want to lose my first real best friend. He forgave me I think but he started to slowly drift apart from me, talking to one of the friends more, spending more time with her and sometimes even ignoring me. He also started to talk with one person from our class that was really shitty towards us some time ago, also he still is mean to me. I try to talk to my, i guess now, friend everyday how i used to but he finds ways to taunt me or simply be mean to me without apparent reason. I apologized to him a lot of times for things I ever said and I did let him know that I'm really not doing it anymore and it was a way for me to cope back then and I'm different now. It seems like he gets it and we're able to joke around and talk normally but he really did prefer to talk with anyone other than me and I don't know if I'll ever get a second chance

Though he accepted my invite to go eat something out, the two of us, like we used to, so I really hope we can revive this friendship if he'll be engaged enough in it"	1bizbd3	i talked about my best friends behaviour with other people	"i know it doesnt sounds as much but i think i did really bad in short during last years summer break my best friend renewed contact with his old friend and started to act really mean towards me even though i asked him to stop i started to tell my other  friends about his behaviour not to make him look bad in front of them they also are friends with him but because these were the only people that would help me to calm down or let me know how to act in this situation

When we got to my house I told my dad that my mom had given the OK for the sleepover, and a few hours later when my mom came home I told her that my dad had said it was alright.

We watched Finding Nemo and ate cantaloupe on the floor of my livingroom, and the whole night I was dreading the morning, expecting to get in trouble once my friend left

362	When I was 18/19, I over shared my problems with a child	"This is something I feel a lot of guilt over.  When I was 18, I joined an online Twitch community for a streamer.  They had around 40 people regularly around in the community.  These people ranged from age 12-40, with most being around 18-20.  After a few months, I had a falling out with the streamer who's community it was, but since I had spent a lot of time there I felt like friends with a lot of the community members.  I started to talk to a handful of them afterwards.  One of them was someone who was 12.  I think they had lied about being 13 but told me at one point they were turning 13 soon.

I was 18 at this point, and I didn't see it as a big deal.  We bonded over being the only people interested in American sports.  (NFL, MLB, NBA)  We would send each other memes, talk about sports games, banter each other's teams.

The darker side was a few times, I would talk about my problems.  The drama within the community, how it was affecting me, my depression and I think at one point I even alluded to not wanting to live anymore.  These are heavy topics to share with anybody, but in the context of a 18/19 year old adult sharing this with a random 12/13 year old online, I feel it was extremely inappropriate and I feel guilty for any effect my actions may have had on him.  We haven't talked in years, I don't plan to.  I thought about reaching out and apologizing but I figure it's best I move on and leave him be.  I can only hope my behavior didn't leave a lasting impact on his life."	1bgzh4j	when i was  i over shared my problems with a child	"this is something i feel a lot of guilt over  when i was  i joined an online twitch community for a streamer  they had around  people regularly around in the community  these people ranged from age  with most being around   after a few months i had a falling out with the streamer whos community it was but since i had spent a lot of time there i felt like friends with a lot of the community members  i started to talk to a handful of them afterwards  one of them was someone who was   i think they had lied about being  but told me at one point they were turning  soon

363	I put my parents in medical debt after lying about being in pain from crashing my moms car	I got my drivers license when I was 16 years old. I was never allowed to touch my mother’s car because it was pretty expensive and fairly new. When my parents left to go on their wedding anniversary, my mother repeatedly told me not to touch her car. I did anyway. I decided to skip the bus and drive my mother’s car to school. School was only about 10 minutes away so I didn’t think she’d notice a difference in the gas. When I got there, so many people crowded around me asking “when did you get a Porsche”, wanting to sit in the drivers seat, calling me cool and all. I thought I was the coolest kid. After school was over, my friend asked if I could drive her home, to which I agreed. Her home was about 20 mins away and required me getting on the highway. On my way home from dropping her off, I was going about 80 mph when I lost control of the car and hit the barrier. I was completely fine with just a few scratches and a little bit of pain from the airbag but nothing concerning. My mom’s car on the other hand was completely totaled. The only thing I could think of was pretending to feel way worse than I actually was, so I could avoid being disciplined. I called for an ambulance and told them I had severe chest and head pain and i even went as far as to pretended I didn’t remember the date and my name. My parents were contacted by the hospital and had to leave their vacation to come to the hospital. While I was there they did a CT scan and found nothing, they did a few other checks that I don’t know the names of but eventually I was cleared to go home. We had to take an Uber and on the way back, my mother couldn’t stop crying about how she could have lost me. A couple weeks later, I overheard my parents talking that they had gotten my medical bill and it was over $10k. My mother also had to purchase a new car on top of that and it had left them with little to no money. My parents ended up having to rent out a room, to hopefully make up the money to pay my bills. I was a stupid kid, and I think about how I ruined everything that day. I’m now way older and have been paying them back the money in increments and when I’m done, I plan on confessing for what I did. 	1bg075l	i put my parents in medical debt after lying about being in pain from crashing my moms car	i got my drivers license when i was  years old i was never allowed to touch my mothers car because it was pretty expensive and fairly new when my parents left to go on their wedding anniversary my mother repeatedly told me not to touch her car i did anyway i decided to skip the bus and drive my mothers car to school school was only about  minutes away so i didnt think shed notice a difference in the gas when i got there so many people crowded around me asking when did you get a porsche wanting to sit in the drivers seat calling me cool and all i thought i was the coolest kid after school was over my friend asked if i could drive her home to which i agreed her home was about  mins away and required me getting on the highway on my way home from dropping her off i was going about  mph when i lost control of the car and hit the barrier i was completely fine with just a few scratches and a little bit of pain from the airbag but nothing concerning my moms car on the other hand was completely totaled the only thing i could think of was pretending to feel way worse than i actually was so i could avoid being disciplined i called for an ambulance and told them i had severe chest and head pain and i even went as far as to pretended i didnt remember the date and my name my parents were contacted by the hospital and had to leave their vacation to come to the hospital while i was there they did a ct scan and found nothing they did a few other checks that i dont know the names of but eventually i was cleared to go home we had to take an uber and on the way back my mother couldnt stop crying about how she could have lost me a couple weeks later i overheard my parents talking that they had gotten my medical bill and it was over k my mother also had to purchase a new car on top of that and it had left them with little to no money my parents ended up having to rent out a room to hopefully make up the money to pay my bills i was a stupid kid and i think about how i ruined everything that day im now way older and have been paying them back the money in increments and when im done i plan on confessing for what i did 	bgl

I ""passed out"" for long enough that she called 999 and by the time I realised the paramedics had arrived, after this seizures were brought up by the hospital and I figured ""hey I have to keep this consistent"". I kept faking these to get out of things I didn't want to do including in school. this gave me the ability to move to classes with people I knew and get a free pass to my schools sensory rooms to reduce stress. I kept gaining from this and all I had to do was flop for a bit. recently I was too tired to flop for long enough to get out of lesson so I simply said that my legs weren't working.  from there it progressed to faking repeated temporary partial paralysis. its gotten me the attention I've been craving but I'm fed up of all the medical tests they've been putting me through to find an explanation.

I understand that what I've done is terrible and I now bear immense guilt for everything I've put my friends and family through. none of them know I'm faking and I don't know where to go from here  


edit to add: ive stopped, still no further on the therapy situation so stop screaming at me abt it. im going to work through as much of my mental shit as i can whether i end up in a psych ward or not, to those who have reached out with kind/ reassuring words that i can change, that this is my first step, that this isnt me, or has just been soft with their words in general i thank you, your probably the reason im here. to those telling me i need to be institutionalised, that im an asshole, wack-ass, childish, i say im 14, this is not an excuse and most of the stuff your telling me i already know.

In August 2021, I was living in a small village in Anatolia. We were building a long concrete wall around our house in our village. For this reason, we worked with someone who is good in this field. Me, my brother my father and that man. We worked from morning to evening for 2 weeks. At the beginning of the second week, my mother had prepared lunch and we took a break from work. The man had his own VW Polo and it was very dirty inside. My mother invited us to dinner. We went too. I was stealing a lot at that time. The man was parking his car in our garage and there were only tractors and agricultural machinery in the garage. Before dinner, I went to get my headphones that I had forgotten in the tractor the night before. I saw the man's car as I was getting out after picking it up. There was a phone in the passenger seat and someone was calling. I didn't care. Then I went to dinner and saw the man talking on another phone. The man had 2 phones. After eating, we drank tea and went back to work. I was used to stealing because I was stealing a lot at that time. I was doing it for my own benefit. Under the pretext of going to the toilet, I went to the man's car and took his phone. I took it home. I went to my room and formatted it because it had a password. Then I removed the SIM card and smashed it. I threw the phone into my bag that I use for school. I had my books in it and I thought no one would suspect it. The man realized that he lost his phone 3 days later and could not find it. He said that he was scolded by his wife. We're finally done. The wall was completed and the man was gone. I never saw the man again after that. School started in September and I was staying with my other brother. He had his own workshop. The rest of my family was farming in the village. During the first week of school, I advertised the phone on a website and found a customer in 2 days. I sold the phone for around 4000 TL (125 USD). I used the money as my own pocket money and nothing bad happened to me."	1bfo79o	i stole someones phone at village and i sold it                                                         	"sorry for my bad grammar i got help from google translate

367	At school, I closed my teachers laptop and my classmate got the blame for it	"This happened in my art class. My teacher was telling some of my classmates that she just changed their grades after a test. One of them said he wanted to see he grade now, and he went over to the teachers desk and looked off her computer. 3 others followed him, and I followed as well. She told us to come away from her desk and not look off her computer, because it's not appropriate. As my classmates walked away from her desk, I stayed and made sure they weren't looking. Then, I closed her laptop. About a minute later she noticed her laptop was closed and asked the 3 who closed it. They were all confused and said they didn't close it. She said ""One of you guys had to have done it, the computer didn't close itself!"" They all just claimed they didn't do it. And then she said ""well whoever did that it wasn't okay!"" She went back to her computer and started working.

The funny thing is, one of my classmates saw me do it but he didn't say anything.

368	When I was eleven or twelve I had a nosebleed all over a library book and returned it	"I had chronic nosebleeds as a kid, especially in the winter. I was also an avid reader and I would check books out from the library in my hometown all the time.

I panicked because I didn’t want my parents to make me use my allowance to pay to replace the book so as soon as I got the bleeding under control I just kinda closed the book and hoped nobody would notice. I put the book back in the return slot the next week and never heard anything else about it.

I realize now that that was a biohazard and I shouldn’t have done it but considering I live in Canada now there’s not much else to be done at this point.

369	I lost my mom’s pure saudi gold earring at school.	"Hi, I am a teenager and I lost my mom’s pure saudi gold earrings at school. Not a while ago, I decided to wear my mom’s earrings that she let me borrow to school, and I did something stupid that may have triggered the earring to become loose, however I didn’t notice until I felt that one of my ear’s felt lighter. And at that moment, my stomach absolutely sunk to find out that the earring was gone. I cried and panicked, I grabbed a few friends and we looked everywhere for hours, yet we found nothing. I also filed a report to the guidance council office, janitors, and security guards, but I have absolutely no hope left. Even though my mom has many expensive jewelry already, I’m still very regretful and sick to my stomach. 

One thing that I know now, is to never trust myself with expensive jewelry and to only stick to simple accessories, regardless of the occasion. 

The only option that I have left is to confess to my mom about the earring, but I don’t know how. I know that I can’t expect much, and that she will most likely lash out on me, but my anxiety has gotten so bad and I have so much problems already, I really need to let go. Please help.

371	I realize how easy shoplifting is and now I can’t stop.	I don’t remember exactly when I first started, it had to be around 7th grade. it was seen as cool to shoplift so I did it. In 8th grade I would take the bus (it was right outside the school) multiple times a week to walmart and steal tons of makeup and snacks. I would go to dollar tree and get a lot of snacks and other stores too. I didn’t have the money for the items I was stealing since I was so young. Don’t judge me for this but around that time is when I started drinking alcohol too. Since I had no way to get the alcohol I would just steal it. I was already good at stealing other things so I was really good about stealing alcohol too. In the summer of 8th grade I would drink and sneak out a bunch. And of course I stole the alcohol or was apart of the group that was stealing. I have never gotten caught shoplifting alcohol but I don’t know how to stop since it’s just so easy. I understand the stores keep contact on you and the price of things you have stolen then once it’s a high amount they get you into trouble. I’m trying to get out of that but I don’t have a job It’s really my only option. . I’m currently in highschool and haven’t been going out to the stores often as I use to (I go maybe once a month now). And I quit alcohol but whenever I go to the store I have this feeling I have to shoplift since it’s so easy.	1be0m45	i realize how easy shoplifting is and now i cant stop	i dont remember exactly when i first started it had to be around th grade it was seen as cool to shoplift so i did it in th grade i would take the bus it was right outside the school multiple times a week to walmart and steal tons of makeup and snacks i would go to dollar tree and get a lot of snacks and other stores too i didnt have the money for the items i was stealing since i was so young dont judge me for this but around that time is when i started drinking alcohol too since i had no way to get the alcohol i would just steal it i was already good at stealing other things so i was really good about stealing alcohol too in the summer of th grade i would drink and sneak out a bunch and of course i stole the alcohol or was apart of the group that was stealing i have never gotten caught shoplifting alcohol but i dont know how to stop since its just so easy i understand the stores keep contact on you and the price of things you have stolen then once its a high amount they get you into trouble im trying to get out of that but i dont have a job its really my only option  im currently in highschool and havent been going out to the stores often as i use to i go maybe once a month now and i quit alcohol but whenever i go to the store i have this feeling i have to shoplift since its so easy	bem
372	I submitted a corrupted file for my final in Uni and still got an A	"A few months ago i had to do a final video presentation for a class in Uni. This includes filming myself present a 15 minutes presentation, upload it to Drive or Youtube and link it, plus submitting the screenshots of slides used in the video. 

I ended up doing it last minute and since I didn't want to submit it late, I just uploaded all the slides I had made and create a corrupted file on Pinetools, using the video file option and everything to make it looked like a real video file, it just that it can't be opened since it's corrupted.

I know it's a stupid decision but this was the last assignment I had to submit and I was way too exhausted and unmotivated. At first I was thinking that since it'll take awhile to be graded, I can make the real presentation video and send it once my professor asks about it. I waited weeks then a month and I didn't get contact at all. Last week I looked up my student record and saw that I already got an A for that class, which meant they finalized it. I guess they couldn't mind the trouble since I have pretty good grades throughout the semester already, and did submit some slides even though there were nothing on there but some graphs.

Now I'm so relieved that I don't have to make the long ass presentation anymore, but felt so guilty because many of my friends had to work so hard on it and I got away with actually not doing much at all.

i ended up doing it last minute and since i didnt want to submit it late i just uploaded all the slides i had made and create a corrupted file on pinetools using the video file option and everything to make it looked like a real video file it just that it cant be opened since its corrupted

i know its a stupid decision but this was the last assignment i had to submit and i was way too exhausted and unmotivated at first i was thinking that since itll take awhile to be graded i can make the real presentation video and send it once my professor asks about it i waited weeks then a month and i didnt get contact at all last week i looked up my student record and saw that i already got an a for that class which meant they finalized it i guess they couldnt mind the trouble since i have pretty good grades throughout the semester already and did submit some slides even though there were nothing on there but some graphs

i had been expecting to be contacted this whole time even thinking of the excuses i was going to use now im so relieved that i dont have to make the long ass presentation anymore but felt so guilty because many of my friends had to work so hard on it and i got away with actually not doing much at all

373	I tell homeless people I have terminal cancer in order to avoid small talk	"# (Disclaimer: I do not actually have cancer.)

TL:DR at the bottom.

Long story short I'm autistic as shit among other things and have zero, ZERO social skills for conversation, which tends to make people very uncomfortable.

And often times when I see a homeless person asking for food or saying they're hungry I approach them and offer them if they'd like a footlong sandwich or something tasty, they always say yes.

There's no real reason I do this other than the fact that I can. I don't feel sad for them or believe in karma or God or whatever. Someone is hungry and I can help, I don't need any other reason. *(That explanation has been met with a wide range of reactions by friends, family members and a psychologists, ranging from respect to outright horror)*

*This is fine and all.* ***HOWEVER***, as we walk to the store or whatever they always try to make small talk and ask me **WHY** I'm doing this, they ask if I'm religious or if I believe in a greater good or something or they try to explain why they are in this situation (I don't care, but it has been explained to me that people feel kind of ashamed in those situations. Boy have I said the wrong thing before learning that).

And things get awkward as all hell as I don't know what to say when someone tells me they lost their job and things ""didn't go their way"" in some way or the other because my go to response ""Oh man that sucks"" has been met with visible discomfort.

So I've come up with the solution of just sledgehammering them as soon as they ask ""Why are you doing this?"" with: **""I have terminal cancer, I don't have much left so... I guess I'd do something nice before I go""** and they always get really quiet and mournful of my ""situation"", so I get them the food (sometimes i ask how many family members they have and buy food for the whole family) and afterwards they cry and wish me good luck and tell me I'm going to heaven or that they'll pray for me, I laugh nicely and say things like ""Haha, thank you for your kind words.""

Sometimes I have brain cancer, sometimes i have lung cancer, whatever cancer I feel like having. I have noticed it's a great way to skip smalltalk and get out of that situation quickly. No one knows I do the cancer thing.

tl;dr i like feeding homeless people but I make them uncomfortable when making small talk so I just tell them I'm dying of cancer to skip the conversation."	1bdtb1i	i tell homeless people i have terminal cancer in order to avoid small talk	" disclaimer i do not actually have cancer

375	I sold a biohazardous camper for a crazy price to a pregnant couple	"This is a burner account because I need this off my chest but don't want it tied to me.

A relative died gruesomely in a camper. I was next of kin, so I was saddled with the responsibility of getting rid of it. I was told outright that I can't legally sell it until it's remediated, although I'm not convinced that was true. 

I was also homeless at the time but gahhh, this camper was nasty, and the fact that it was my own relative's *organic matter* all over it, and it had been sitting closed up for weeks... I didn't want to mess with it. 

I tried calling remediation services but found them to be expensive, and there was really no assistance that I could find for poor people, such as myself.

After a month of getting nowhere, one of my friends convinced me to put it on Facebook Marketplace for $1000. I said they were insane, nobody will pay that! 

I was completely honest in the listing, even with detailed photos. I have no idea how Facebook let me post it with those photos. It was something that would be covered if it was in the news feed. I didn't even take the personal effects out, because none of it was untouched.

Within a day of posting, a pregnant woman and her boyfriend showed up and bought it. They said they weren't afraid of some deep cleaning, and they paid $150 below my asking price.

I used the money to get into the house I'm still living in now, years later. I still feel like a total POS for putting the couple/baby at risk for my own personal gain."	1bdelpb	i sold a biohazardous camper for a crazy price to a pregnant couple	"this is a burner account because i need this off my chest but dont want it tied to me

376	I used to be a terrible person and I owe everyone and everything an apology	"This is not as serious as many posts here but I used to be a pretty bad kid. I would harass people I deemed annoying, which many were. I would intentionally annoy and harass them because I thought it was funny and getting ""revenge"" on them. One time, I kept saying some kid's name in a funny way which I knew would make him cry in 2nd grade. He was special needs and I didn't even realize it at the time.

I would lie to my friends about having things happen to me and make up fake stories. I would make up situations to my friends that never happened to me just to seem cool and have a feeling of satisfaction.

When I was 14 I knew there was some kid who had trauma happen to him (not by me), and I had mental issues happening at the time (not an excuse). I purposely harassed this kid knowing that it would make him feel PTSD. I might have not wanted him to feel bad but idk for sure.

I used to lightly hit my brother until he raged and then we got into fights from it. I would also be a hypocrite and do stupid things to him like take away his iPad and then I would get really mad for some reason when he did something back.

Now I look at my past-self and think how bad I was. I apologized to my younger brother, I have no idea where the kid with disabilities is and I don't think he even cares/remembers but I would like to still apologize. To the kid with PTSD I'm very sorry I hope you're doing better and found good in life. Just wanted to get these off my chest.

So I ran, ran and ran. I had done it. 


Months months months later, I went there again, this time the display was covered with glass (bless the owners heart) but then I saw the figure again. they had replaced it. I felt so bad for stealing it, I just left the store ( I bought something of course) and never went back again.

378	I walked out on a guy in a bar and left him with a bill he couldnt pay	"When i was out on my own in the city this one guy approached me. He asked me if i wanted to go to a bar with him and as i had no other plans i agreed to come with him. When we were at the bar, he kept asking me how much money i had with me. I told him i had 10 €s  and he said he had that much too. We then ordered drinks and i noticed that he couldnt really hold a conversation and i got annoyed by that. He didnt understand my questions either, kept telling me the same things (he wanted a woman who was good and who he could go on walks with and to have children). He also kept showing me pictures of himself and his family and that was basically our interaction. I eventually grew tired of this and grabbed my stuff, saying i was going to go to the bathroom. He kept following me into the ladies' room and when i told him he couldnt come in he waited outside. We then went back to the bar and he proceded to pay the bill, asking me for money. I then faked a phonecall and told him i had to go outside to talk. Then i just left and walked away, leaving him with a bill he probably couldnt pay. I was angry at him for wasting my time, also at myself for agreeing to come with him out of boredom. 
Looking back at it, i feel kinda shitty for doing that, but also think i would probably do it again if i was back in the situation. Any thoughts on that?

Edit for clarification: he invited me for drinks, the 'drinks' he paid for me was 1 redbull and i took my belongings with me to the toilet because i dont leave my stuff with people i dont know, not because it was my plan to not come back. And i didnt feel obliged to pay because he had invited me in the first place and i felt like it is a shitty move to invite so and then to change your mind once drinks were served. Also during conversation i repeatedly told him that i felt like the conversation was going nowhere/we were kinda crosstalking which he did not pick up on anyways."	1bb36sn	i walked out on a guy in a bar and left him with a bill he couldnt pay	"when i was out on my own in the city this one guy approached me he asked me if i wanted to go to a bar with him and as i had no other plans i agreed to come with him when we were at the bar he kept asking me how much money i had with me i told him i had  s  and he said he had that much too we then ordered drinks and i noticed that he couldnt really hold a conversation and i got annoyed by that he didnt understand my questions either kept telling me the same things he wanted a woman who was good and who he could go on walks with and to have children he also kept showing me pictures of himself and his family and that was basically our interaction i eventually grew tired of this and grabbed my stuff saying i was going to go to the bathroom he kept following me into the ladies room and when i told him he couldnt come in he waited outside we then went back to the bar and he proceded to pay the bill asking me for money i then faked a phonecall and told him i had to go outside to talk then i just left and walked away leaving him with a bill he probably couldnt pay i was angry at him for wasting my time also at myself for agreeing to come with him out of boredom

379	I Lost $100 During the First Month of My Very First Job	"I feel like enough time has passed that I can get this off of my chest and not fear repercussions of anyone at my job finding this out. While home from college, I decided to get a job at a retail store near me. The Covid lockdown was finally lightening up and no one in my household was immune compromised, so I jumped at the chance to get back into the real world. Though past 18 years old, I had never been employed at a steady job. I had done summer camps in the past, but those were seasonal obligations and they were more like volunteering gigs if anything. Since I had slim to nothing on my resume, I decided to lie and say that I had two years of receptionist experience from working at a family member’s business. They didn’t check my recommendations deeply enough to see the total lie and I was practically hired on the spot. Two weeks in, they began training me on register. I HATE math. I have always been horrible at it no matter how many hours I dedicate to improving. It usually ends with me getting super embarrassed and shutting down. The first week was tough. I was practically throwing random coins at customers hoping that the register would be even and that the change I gave was accurate enough to not raise any eyebrows. By the second week, however, I had really improved. By the end of the month, I actually looked forward to being on register. That premature surge of confidence turned out to be my undoing.

When on register, we are required to scan all $100 and $50 dollar bills to ensure they are indeed real. While on register, a customer handed me a $100 dollar bill. I tried to use my scanner to check the bill, but my machine wasn’t working. I asked the girl next to me to scan the bill on her machine and to hand it back if approved, which she did. After that, I can only describe my next few steps as a complete and utter blur. I had been so tired and had not needed to take my ADHD meds since high school, as my major in college did not rely heavily on math. I remember slamming the register door closed, helping the next customer in line, and then getting a surge of absolute dread. There had been two $100 dollar bills before that transaction and I could not remember if I had put the additional third bill in the register. The registers lock once closed and only managers can open them. I refused to inform the manager of my fuck up and decided to stay quiet until I could check myself during the next transaction paying with cash. To my horror, there were still only two $100 bills. I went into full panic mode. I asked the girl next to me if she had handed me back the bill, which of course she had. That I had remembered, but I was so desperate for her to say “Oh, whoops! I have it right here. Here you go!” She did not, and now I had a witness in the missing $100 bill caper.

I checked my section multiple times, which only stressed me out more because I known the cameras were capturing my every move. At the end of my shift, I had successfully gaslit myself in to believing that maybe the register was only supposed to have to $100’s after all. To this day, I do not know what happened to that $100 bill.

The next time I worked was two days after the incident. We were all sat down in a very serious meeting. They told us that $100 had gone missing and the managers had spent all night recounting the registers in hopes of finding it only to be reprimanded by their superior for losing so much money in one night. Pissed off by getting chewed out by the higher ups, they stated that they were determined to find the culprit. It took everything within me to not start crying right then and there. All that I could think of was the cameras on the register. They would see me panic on camera, not to mention the coworker that I had mentioned to $100 to could expose me at any minute. I was screwed. 

I spent my break crying on my phone with my mom in front of a Popeyes as I prepared to come clean before they caught me first. I knew it would look bad. No way they would believe that I accidentally “lost” the $100 bill. I was going to get fired at my first ever job after only less than a month. My family finally convinced me to stay silent, ensuring me that they were bluffing and had no clue. Years later, I am still at said job in a managerial position and spend every shift working my hardest to make it up to my fellow managers.

380	I took the life of an innocent pet rabbit when I was 11/12	"This wasn’t too long ago either, I’m only 16, and this hangs heavy on my conscience every time I think about it.

I can’t even think of a way to make sense of it. This was during the lockdown during to the pandemic, so I may have not been in the best state of mind due to the isolation. That’s far from an acceptable excuse and/or reason for my actions. I can’t even go into detail remembering it without breaking down, so I’ll save us all the trouble and won’t.

I guess it may have come from a feeling of power or something. Feeling superior or whatever. It was just an innocent little animal and I just took its life with my own hands. For no fucking reason. I can’t even deal with the fact that it was me, but it was and it fucks with me every day. I mean I’ve heard stories of like little kids terrorizing animals because like maybe of the same reasons or they don’t know any better or are fucked up in the head. But I wasn’t a little kid, I was a preteen, so it makes it so much worse. 

And if it wasn’t already bad, I remember when I was with my mom at the pet store getting the rabbit. I was a little brat always begging for a little rabbit that I wasn’t nearly ready for, let alone wasn’t to be trusted with apparently. Anyway I digress, I remember talking to her in the store, and the worker said the cage plus the animal all added up to like $400, and my mom said “it’s this or a ps5” since they roughly cost the same. And I adamantly chose the poor animal.  

I don’t even feel like I deserve to say I’ve changed as a person because of how short time has passed, only about 3-4 years. But I feel like have, so much has happened for me I feel like a totally different person than I was. And I hope I’ve grown past the deplorable person I was.  

I’m catholic, and every time I go to confession i think about confessing it to a priest, though I never have the courage to admit it. I just sit there and tell all my stupid sins without telling the actual thing weighing on my soul like a coward due to the feeling of being judged. 

I’m crying while typing this from the sheer shame I have. Even telling this to complete strangers is difficult but I have to get this off of me. 

Any criticisms and judgements on my character are well deserved, and any tips on how to cope with this are welcome. I’m deeply remorseful and I try everyday to be better than who I was. I’m so sorry. 

I should’ve chosen the ps5.

381	I made thousands off a side hustle website without ever going to the jobs	Years ago I signed up for an online side hustle job for extra income. It was mostly for people who needed help mounting a TV or fixing stuff or doing simple work around the house. I signed up saying I had a little knowledge in Electrical work and every offer I received was towards electrical work with some other smaller jobs. First job I accepted was for a clogged tub in some guy's house. I went over with a drain snake and draino (I paid $10 for everything) and got the tub unclogged in 10 minutes and made $120 for it. Next job I accepted was installing an outlet for $250 however I stayed up late and overslept, missing the job but I still got paid the $250 expecting it to be taken out. It never did.. I accepted another simple job the next day for $60 and purposely missed it, still got paid for it.

382	I slapped a nurse who was just trying to do her job.	When I was 14 I had to get a minor operation, and I was very nervous. That anxiety increased as I was preparing, and by the time I was about to be put under I was full on panicking. A nurse came up to me with an oxygen mask and tried to put it on me, but I went into fight or flight mode and slapped her. I don’t remember what happened after that. 	1b89o4h	i slapped a nurse who was just trying to do her job	when i was  i had to get a minor operation and i was very nervous that anxiety increased as i was preparing and by the time i was about to be put under i was full on panicking a nurse came up to me with an oxygen mask and tried to put it on me but i went into fight or flight mode and slapped her i dont remember what happened after that 	boh
383	When I was in 1st grade I braided boogers into a girls hair because she was mean to me.	When I was in first grade there was a girl who was pretty mean to me and long story short, I just kinda thought she was a bitch. She was one of those girls who would be mean to you and expect you to be okay with it and nice to her and whatever. Obviously now that I’m grown and I work with kids that age I understand that they can just be that way and it’s usually just a reflection of their parents behavior. Anyways, I don’t really feel like what I did was so awful, not because as an adult I still think she deserved it, but just because it’s generally just kind of funny and harmless. She let me braid her hair while we were all sitting in a group on the floor watching a movie or something like that. As I I braided, I picked my nose and purposely braided my boogers into her hair. I still laugh thinking about it, because I’ve thought it over and the way the other kids treated me at that age was despicable (kicking me to the ground on my birthday, not letting me play on most playground equipment unless I agreed to play the “ugly girl” or boy in pretend, telling me I was “lower class,” convincing me I couldn’t be their friend unless I decided to become a Christian, constantly telling me I was going to hell, breaking into the bathroom stalls while I was using them, racism etc….. our teachers saw most of this behavior and did nothing so it really was on them), so my small retribution led to nothing besides the likely possibility that when she got home and her parents went to comb her hair, they were probably like “what the fuck” when the comb kept getting stuck in the snot I’d braided in. So I’m kind of proud that I resorted to braiding boogers into a girl’s hair instead of violence, prejudice, bigotry or exclusion like they did. I do feel bad, however, learning that this same girl went on to abuse substance so badly that she’s (apparently, from what I’ve been told) now pretty much a vegetable. I don’t blame myself for that, my booger braiding was not the reason why she got to that point and I’m really not sure why it ended up that way for her. I assume she probably fell into the wrong crowd or what have you; I’d never be one to shame someone for that, I have no place to speak, but thankfully I am doing better and recovering. Like I said though, regardless of all of that, I do feel sad to know that she landed in such an unthinkable situation and I still have empathy for her. I hope she’s being taken care of well and of course, I forgive her for her past meanness. She was nicer in high school. I always hope the best for people. But in a vacuum, I do think it’s pretty funny that I braided boogers into a girls hair when I was like, 7 years old. 	1b7opbr	when i was in st grade i braided boogers into a girls hair because she was mean to me	when i was in first grade there was a girl who was pretty mean to me and long story short i just kinda thought she was a bitch she was one of those girls who would be mean to you and expect you to be okay with it and nice to her and whatever obviously now that im grown and i work with kids that age i understand that they can just be that way and its usually just a reflection of their parents behavior anyways i dont really feel like what i did was so awful not because as an adult i still think she deserved it but just because its generally just kind of funny and harmless she let me braid her hair while we were all sitting in a group on the floor watching a movie or something like that as i i braided i picked my nose and purposely braided my boogers into her hair i still laugh thinking about it because ive thought it over and the way the other kids treated me at that age was despicable kicking me to the ground on my birthday not letting me play on most playground equipment unless i agreed to play the ugly girl or boy in pretend telling me i was lower class convincing me i couldnt be their friend unless i decided to become a christian constantly telling me i was going to hell breaking into the bathroom stalls while i was using them racism etc our teachers saw most of this behavior and did nothing so it really was on them so my small retribution led to nothing besides the likely possibility that when she got home and her parents went to comb her hair they were probably like what the fuck when the comb kept getting stuck in the snot id braided in so im kind of proud that i resorted to braiding boogers into a girls hair instead of violence prejudice bigotry or exclusion like they did i do feel bad however learning that this same girl went on to abuse substance so badly that shes apparently from what ive been told now pretty much a vegetable i dont blame myself for that my booger braiding was not the reason why she got to that point and im really not sure why it ended up that way for her i assume she probably fell into the wrong crowd or what have you id never be one to shame someone for that i have no place to speak but thankfully i am doing better and recovering like i said though regardless of all of that i do feel sad to know that she landed in such an unthinkable situation and i still have empathy for her i hope shes being taken care of well and of course i forgive her for her past meanness she was nicer in high school i always hope the best for people but in a vacuum i do think its pretty funny that i braided boogers into a girls hair when i was like  years old 	bopbr
384	I fed a kid a orbee and told him it was a fish oil tablet	"When I was around 8, I really didn’t like this boy (for no apparent reason) and I would pick on him. I fed him shavings of rubber and told him it was chewing gum, I kicked him in the balls and then I told my mum he bullied me, so she told the principal. I remember somebody gave me a clear orbee and it reminded me of the pills my mum would give me. I told him to take the supplement and he believed me and ate it. After I told him what it was, he had to go home and I think he avoided me after.
Looking back, I do feel guilty about everything and wish I hadn’t been such a mean kid. I’ve learned from my mistakes and I’m trying to not be quite so evil now lol. I did see him a couple years back and apologised for the whole ordeal, but he seems to have forgotten about it?

385	I have been ignorant towards my rudeness and derogatory remarks and insensitive about others.	"Hello, so essentially, I’ve had an extreme moment of self reflection/awareness.
 I was gaming as I normally would and was exposed to what it’s like to be on the receiving end of insults or being unaware and respectful to others feelings and emotions, thoughts and ideas. 
Being 25M, it had occurred to me to be courteous to others at a much younger age, but with time I’ve lost sight of how kind and considerate, but not weak, I could be to others. I suppose this was a “wake up call” to learn to watch what you say and remember I’m not some edgy 18 year old anymore and I’m a fully functioning human and so are others. I’ve been on this path of self improvement and care for a while, and while this should be one of the first things to learn off the bat, it’s easy for me to be short sighted on the basics of understanding.

386	When I was eleven, I let my parents think I chipped the TV because I was angry that they were arguing. The truth was that I was hyped up and swinging around a broom while watching Mortal Kombat.	I chipped the TV while they were out of town. I waited for them to get home, worried the entire time. When they arrived, I expected to get screamed at, maybe even attacked. I thought that day was going to be the last day I ever saw my Nintendo 64.

387	I hid the tablespoon measure from my flatmate who had an ED.	She would always measure out peanut butter for sandwiches. I totally understand measuring it out once to see what a serving looks like, but this was excessive and I was tired of the measuring spoons always being dirty. The measuring spoons were mine, so I started keeping them in my room and bringing them out when I wanted to use them. Nearly 10 years later, this still makes me cringe regularly. I knew very little about EDs at the time, but it was so unbelievably petty. 	1b4yv21	i hid the tablespoon measure from my flatmate who had an ed	she would always measure out peanut butter for sandwiches i totally understand measuring it out once to see what a serving looks like but this was excessive and i was tired of the measuring spoons always being dirty the measuring spoons were mine so i started keeping them in my room and bringing them out when i wanted to use them nearly  years later this still makes me cringe regularly i knew very little about eds at the time but it was so unbelievably petty 	byv
388	I bullied a girl in my class when I was in second grade	"So, it's been about 14 years I was in 2rd grade and there was this girl who once accidentally (probably idk if it was intensional) threw ink on me. I cried almost instantly since I thought my mom would be mad regardless of what I tell her. I went to home but my mother wasn't mad and she understood but I was still stressed. So, on the next day I decided to stick bubble gum on her hair causing her to cut it really short. I was really sorry about it since after this incident she became quite sad for next few days she had really beautiful long hair that she was really proud of. We became friends the next year and we have been friends till this day. We even attended the same high school and had the same friend group and she is one of my closest friends. But she doesn't know I was the guy who did that to her and I can't seem to find the courage to confess this to her.

Update: so I finally confessed to her about it. And her reaction was what you guys expected but I didn't. She laughed ""so you were that guy"". I was stunned and she told me it was okay she was indeed mad at the time but as we grew older that incident become a faint memory she no longer londs it against me.

389	I used the candy gram system to spread chaos in my middle school	"Lighthearted confession here. In middle school, we had an evening party once a quarter with dancing, sports, bingo, etc. They also sold candy grams for 50 cents which would deliver a little note with a bag of candy to the recipient. 

I learned that if you purchased candy grams at the end of the night, they would be delivered during school the next day, and my plan was born. I would spend 2-5 dollars and send anonymous I like you notes to random people and watch everyone freak out the next day and check handwritings to figure out who sent it.

392	I went on a bender after figuring out I might’ve been pregnant and caused my own miscarriage 	"This had happened a few months ago, so timing might be a little off. This is also my first time using Reddit so apologies, i’m not quite sure how everything works yet. I am 17 and a child of a teen mom. Not long after a break up with my long term boyfriend,I was not in the right mindset and needed a distraction. I slept with my coworker and tried to be careful but didn’t use protection. I already knew a mistake was made, I just wanted to feel something, even for a couple of minutes. After a couple of weeks, I started feeling uneasy in the mornings and felt some firmness around my pelvic area as well as my period being late. I doubted the possibility and just started partying a little more than usual, my friends and coworkers at the time assumed my drinking was from my breakup and didn’t pay any mind. After a little more time, I noticed some bloating and started to genuinely freak out. This caused me to spiral and start to drinking heavily and cause damage to my abdomen like purposely running into tables and punching myself. After some time of this constant punishment, I noticed bleeding and blood clotting that was consistent for a few days. During this time, I was a wreck. I had terrible cramps and the whole thing made me go into a deep depression. I knew what I did was bad and that it would haunt me for a while. After everything was done and my next period came and went, I still thought about my nonexistent/potential baby. What if I didn’t go out of control, if it was going to be a boy or girl, etc. I know I don’t want children, now or ever, but I had a dream that I was playing with this little girl. She was maybe around 5/6, calling me mama and such, which is the whole reason I needed to get this off my chest. I know I should’ve taken a test but I was so overwhelmed and I thought that if I never took a test, I wouldn’t have the confirmation I dreaded. I’m so used to being alone and doing everything myself that I thought I could fix my mistake alone. I never told anyone what happened, why? I’m not sure and I don’t think I ever will.

[EDIT] I just wanted to answer some of the questions I’ve seen in the comments. I know some were concerned about the age of my coworker, he was older than me being 20 at the time and yes I know that was wrong and I have addressed it in my life. Others were wondering about my mom involvement during my bender and my childhood, my mom does have some mental health issues and she was not very present while I was growing up and she struggled a lot with her own addictions and such, in no way am I blaming her or using this as an excuse, I was a very sheltered child and was didn’t have access to sex ed until around the beginning of hs but due to some family stuff I was never actually educated on the subject. My mom is much better now and works most of the time, she allows me to drink but I’ve only ever drank with her before my bender, I’m not a big drinker and it’s not something I’m interested in doing in the future. I am planning to do to the doctors to make sure everything is okay, the situation was stressful and I take full responsibility for my actions and used this as a learning lesson. I have since done my best to educate myself on sex and all its variables. Thank you to those who educated me and for the kind words.

393	I just cashed a lottery scratcher I didn't pay for.	"I decided ""fuck it"" and threw $10 into a scratcher machine and bought one $10 ticket.  This is even worse considering I'm unemployed and using state resources.  I've spent $300 in Food Stamps this month, have gotten 3 free prescriptions, and just this week I've had 3 free doctors' appointments.

Instead of one ticket, the machine accidentally spit out three.  They were all folded together so the machine didn't tear them off like it was supposed to.

I scratched the first ticket (the one that I paid for) and nothing.  So I scratched the second and third tickets, the one I didn't pay for, and I won $50.

I said to myself, ""Is this right?  Should I throw it in the trash?""  Well, I didn't throw it away, I got my $50.  

I justified it in two ways.  First, the lottery is fucking predatory.  With slogans like ""Hey, it could happen!"" and ""Imagine what a buck could get you..."" it's selling false hopes and dreams to people who will never get out of a shitty situation.  Second, I once couldn't cash in a $10 winning ticket while in another state (at the airport) because there was no fucking attendant next to the machine selling the tickets.  How can you sell tickets but not allow people to cash them in?

394	Sent a girl to the ER When i was in kindergarten .	"When I was in kindergarten (currently in 11th grade(female) ), We went outside for recess. My elementary school had the tiny oval rocks on the playground so when it was time to go in as i was walking through the doors i noticed i had some rocks still in my shoe. Since I was in kindergarten, I had a long walk back down to the kindergarten class rooms. I don’t know if any of y’all schools had nap time after recess but that’s what my school was like so I put my sleeping Mat next to my friend and I laid down. I remembered I had rocks in my shoe so I took the rocks out (there were two) I threw one across the room, and I shoved the other one in my friends nose. it apparently got stuck in her nose canal and she had to go to the hospital and they had to get it out.

395	I keep digging myself into deeper debt because I am a shopaholic	"To be honest, the title says it all. But, for more context, and to give an understanding of just how bad this has gotten, I suppose I should elaborate. 

I come from nothing. I grew up with nothing. I endured awful things just to keep me and my siblings safe and alive. But this post isn't about that. This is just context.

Ass I grew up, I learned how to make the most of every situation. And ended up with nice homes and decent cars and basically was just about spoiled with whatever I wanted, within reason.

But I decided I didn't want to live as a dependent anymore. So I started to truly build a life for myself. I got certifications that allowed me to work decent paying jobs and then got into better jobs as I earned better certifications. Finally, my ""big break""came. I opened many credit cards with decent starting lines of credit. I bought a fairly expensive car. I moved into a bigger place. And then I started shopping. 

First it was for ""necessities"" like new furniture because I didn't have any. Then nice appliances because the other ones were just so old. 

I had, throughout my efforts to become a better person, lost a lot of weight. So, naturally, I needed a new wardrobe. I started buying hundreds of dollars worth of clothes and shoes every week. And accessories. And anything that caught my eye, really. I bought a PS5 and new OLED Steamdeck on the same day. I continue to buy more and more... collectibles, clothes, games, electronics, etc.
My room looks like a literal shipping warehouse - full of unopened packages that I've bought and have no space for, nor the energy to go through in the first place. 

The issue is that I cannot afford to keep this up. My cards are all nearly maxed at this point and while I haven't missed a beat in paying them and I do pay more than the minimums... how long can I keep up this sort of lifestyle?

I feel ashamed of myself. I very much knew the consequences of my actions. I know how credit works. Even if it was bipolar mania or depressive shopping therapy or whatever kind of excuse my therapist could throw at it, it was wrong. It is wrong. 

I wish I could have stopped myself even 2 months ago and said,  ""that's enough."" I don't have anything to prove to anyone so I don't know why I'm doing this. And I'm far too prideful and stubborn for debt relief or debt settlement programs. I don't see myself that far gone yet...

I guess I just wanted to get this off of my chest. I'll be working on paying my debts down from here on and controlling my spending. 

Thank you all for reading my ramblings. "	1b2ukdz	i keep digging myself into deeper debt because i am a shopaholic	"to be honest the title says it all but for more context and to give an understanding of just how bad this has gotten i suppose i should elaborate

i guess i just wanted to get this off of my chest ill be working on paying my debts down from here on and controlling my spending 

thank you all for reading my ramblings "	bukdz

397	I borrowed 1000$ from a friend and never paid her back	"21f. Anonymous account because I am ashamed but need to get this off my chest.

Ok so this is way longer than I thought maybe I should've written it in r/vent sorry

So I've been struggling with depression and probably other mental issues for years. As in I can't keep a job, I got kicked out of college for failing all my classes and I basically became the archetype of the bum kid that spends their days in their parent's basement . Sometimes I would isolate myself and not talk to anyone for monthes. Sometimes I was almost in a catatonic state just staring at my ceiling day in, day out as the days blended together in a numb trance for monthes. My parents wanted me to get an appartement so it could motivate me to grow up so I did. They thought I had savings but I spent it all (mostly car repairs and glasses🥴) so after paying the deposit I moved out with 0$ in my bank account. 
I didn't wanna get roomates I didn't know so I asked my friend who'se lease ended soon if she wanted to move in together and she agreed even tho I knew damn well I wasn't ready to move out. Now I feel extremely guilty about it. I should've let her be.

So at first we both paid rent late because we were forgetful and the landlord was really chill about it but I didn't pay for 2 monthes because I was very broke and I do doordash and had to repair my car and it cost 1000$+ So of course, my once chill landlord got sick of it and took us to court to get me to pay and evict us. I honestly knew it was coming but I naively thought I was the only one that would go to court and get evicted and I just accepted it. Turns out we were both liable and it was her name too that was called for court. I was so anxious that I litteraly only told her 1hour before court we had to go to court which is so fucked up I know. I asked her if she could pay the 2 monthes I didn't pay because the landlord said if I paid he would cancel the court hearing and then we wouldn't have a permanent public records of late paiement which will make it impossible to get another appartement. She agreed and I said I would pay her back. The landlord still took us to court. The judge ruled against the eviction. But my roomate got too anxious about the situation so she moved back in with her family. She hadn't talked to them in more than a year and moved out to get away from them but she had to go back to them because of me. 
She wanted me to pay her back in a week but I didn't have the money. I kept not having the money for numerous reasons but it was partly my fault because I should have gotten something more stable than doordash. I was terrible with communication and it stressed her out a lot. 
Me and my dad hung out one day. He asked me how I was doing and I said I was doing good even tho I was on the verge of homelessness since I had to pay rent alone and couldn't afford it at all. The whole hang out was normal. Then at the end he told me he knew everything, my roomate had messaged him about the money. He paid her, he paid the rent I owed. I was driving on expired plates for monthes and he paid for that. I cried so much because I had been lying for monthes to everyone saying I was fine even tho the landlord would be knocking on the door several times, I was stresssed out of my mind about money knowing I was one car problem away from having no stream of income. When bills would pass I would not eat sometimes. I know I'm so mentally fucked. I could've gotten a better job than fucking doordash. I could've asked for help but I thought my parents would hate me and be sick of me and cut me off if I did. I couldn't handle them hating me so I was just gonna be homeless or kms. I really fucked up and caused so much stress to someone I considered a good friend. She's such a good person and didn't deserve what I put her through. The landlord also didn't deserve that. And I'm still living in the appartement even tho he wants me gone cuz I can't find anything else and I know it's pissing him off. Even when she messaged my dad there was an undertone of concern for me. It's like it would've been easier if she hated me. but instead last time I saw her she just stared at me with pity. The same look people have been giving me lately. Like they see this mentally unstable loser and can't even be mad just feel bad and be exasperated. I wanted to figure things out so bad and be the one to pay her back, but I failed again. I didn't wanna be a loser anymore. I wrote on here because I trust strangers to be unfiltered instead of feeling bad for me. I only told people really close to me about the situation and they are nice about it but I need people to not be."	1b22iyp	i borrowed  from a friend and never paid her back	"f anonymous account because i am ashamed but need to get this off my chest

398	Gave up life of crime to be very poor instead (27F)	"Not sure how much I can/should say. I'm not proud of this. It's just been on my mind lately. Ive had to lie so much, I almost forget that this is the truth. From the time I was a teenager - mid 20s, I was doing illegal things for money. Not hurting anyone, but illegal none the less. 2 yrs ago I was offered to take over the 'company'. Would have been all expenses paid move to a nearby city, beautiful house, barely any work and 1 million + yearly income. Anyway I decided it was too much, couldn't bare the thought of being caught and leaving my son while I was in jail for 15 yrs. Also I know how to feels to be scared every time there's a knock on the door, to always think you're being followed, and to wake up each day wondering if it's your last day being free. 

So I quit completely. It's been bad. I'm not adjusted to normal life, and I have nothing to put on a resume. Even though I have a LOT of experience that could be relevant to other jobs. My resume is empty. My fault I know. Kicking myself for setting my life up like this. All I do now is deliver food. I make barely enough to get by. It's always stress and fear about bills. However I never regret my decision. At least life is predictable and I know I won't hurt my son by being in jail.

401	I’ve lied about shifting to over 100k people and I don’t know why. 	"For context there’s this “phenomenon” on tiktok called reality shifting where apparently people are making up realities and shifting their consciousness into that reality. Anyways in early summer 2022 I was super into stranger things cause the newest season had just came out. I was completely in love with one of the characters (steve) and wanted to go to that world and be with the characters. One day on tiktok I was scrolling on tiktok when I came across a video talking about shifting. I kind of knew what shifting was but never really looked into it. This video started my interest in shifting. I was looking into other peoples experiences and how to do it, so I started to try. I had been trying for about a month but still no real success, i was getting extremely annoying. I also started my own shifting tiktok account where i had about 500 followers. I’m not sure what possessed me to do it but i started completely lying about it. I told my close friends about how I apparently shifted and told them all these made up stories how I was best friends with them all. At this point I had 1.5k on tiktok and started to lie about shifting on there as well and would tell them these lies and they ate it all up and I kind of got satisfaction in it. I still was trying and for some reason i assumed if i lied about I was somehow manifesting it and speaking it into existence. I didn’t show my face on this account but I would spend hours making scripts and tiktoks and I was eating up the attention I was receiving. Fast forward to October 2022, I kind of started to loose interest in stranger things as I started watching another show (gilmore girls) and quit attempting to shift but I had like 20k, I began telling my followers about how I was shifting to gilmore girls and made up a bunch of methods?? Yeah and in february i reached  50k. I was in a super low point in my life but I still made videos and told people how I was shifting to all these movies and shows, I still did it until about November of 2023 cause i began getting sponsorships and it was a nice way to get money but one day i thought to myself why am I lying about this like what is the point?? So since then I’ve stopped with all of that and personally don’t believe in shifting anymore. But yeah looking back on it I’m like what possessed me to do it?? I still haven’t told my friends or my followers that I made it all up but I fell like I dug myself too deep in the lie way too long ago so i can’t just admit it was all lies now. But yeah i just wanted to get this out cause it was lurking on my mind.

it too sadly . i’ve also matured and realized it wasn’t real awhile ago"	1b1mslj	ive lied about shifting to over k people and i dont know why 	"for context theres this phenomenon on tiktok called reality shifting where apparently people are making up realities and shifting their consciousness into that reality anyways in early summer  i was super into stranger things cause the newest season had just came out i was completely in love with one of the characters steve and wanted to go to that world and be with the characters one day on tiktok i was scrolling on tiktok when i came across a video talking about shifting i kind of knew what shifting was but never really looked into it this video started my interest in shifting i was looking into other peoples experiences and how to do it so i started to try i had been trying for about a month but still no real success i was getting extremely annoying i also started my own shifting tiktok account where i had about  followers im not sure what possessed me to do it but i started completely lying about it i told my close friends about how i apparently shifted and told them all these made up stories how i was best friends with them all at this point i had k on tiktok and started to lie about shifting on there as well and would tell them these lies and they ate it all up and i kind of got satisfaction in it i still was trying and for some reason i assumed if i lied about i was somehow manifesting it and speaking it into existence i didnt show my face on this account but i would spend hours making scripts and tiktoks and i was eating up the attention i was receiving fast forward to october  i kind of started to loose interest in stranger things as i started watching another show gilmore girls and quit attempting to shift but i had like k i began telling my followers about how i was shifting to gilmore girls and made up a bunch of methods yeah and in february i reached  k i was in a super low point in my life but i still made videos and told people how i was shifting to all these movies and shows i still did it until about november of  cause i began getting sponsorships and it was a nice way to get money but one day i thought to myself why am i lying about this like what is the point so since then ive stopped with all of that and personally dont believe in shifting anymore but yeah looking back on it im like what possessed me to do it i still havent told my friends or my followers that i made it all up but i fell like i dug myself too deep in the lie way too long ago so i cant just admit it was all lies now but yeah i just wanted to get this out cause it was lurking on my mind

402	I contaminated my customers drink one time and can't forget it	So I was a waitress at a white table top restaurant for three years, starting at the age of 19. I only worked breakfast shift. I had a table ask for grapefruit juice and it was the last of it that we had. I poured it into the fancy stemmed glass in the kitchen and noticed it was kind of dark and I started wondering if it had gone bad so I literally dipped my tongue into their glass to taste it and see. It was fine so I just proceeded to deliver their drink to their table without saying a word. It haunts me to this day that I literally tongued someones drink and I still can't figure out why I didn't just get a spoon and taste it that way. 	1b1lbsk	i contaminated my customers drink one time and cant forget it	so i was a waitress at a white table top restaurant for three years starting at the age of  i only worked breakfast shift i had a table ask for grapefruit juice and it was the last of it that we had i poured it into the fancy stemmed glass in the kitchen and noticed it was kind of dark and i started wondering if it had gone bad so i literally dipped my tongue into their glass to taste it and see it was fine so i just proceeded to deliver their drink to their table without saying a word it haunts me to this day that i literally tongued someones drink and i still cant figure out why i didnt just get a spoon and taste it that way 	blbsk

407	I touched this girl while i was drunk and I just can’t live with it	I went to go on a party with my friends in another city in my country. After the party we got to the house of a girl to sleep, we continued to drink alcohol and this where it start. The day after I woke up with no memory but my friends told me I touched this one girl. I didn’t understand at the first time but when they explained me they said this was not that bad just that I was trying to lay down and that I touched it while I was laying, so I said I was sorry and that I will hate myself for that. But weeks later she texted my friend to say that she was feeling bad about it and that she wasn’t feeling good in her body because of that. So when my friend told it to me I was really shocked, so I texted her for trying to help her and myself because I can’t stand to hurt poeple so I tried to manage things to make her feel good and I succeeded to do it, BUT she told me that it was longer so I asked to my other friend who said it was not true so idk, but I just feel shit about it and I truly hate myself for that. Can you say me how I have to feel about it…… (I modified to explain some things) So all the poeple at the party said that I just falled and my hand touched her vagina but I removed it a second after, I have to say that I would not do it on purpose, why : because this girl is not my type of girl, because even before I met her I was always trying to disgust her because I didn’t want our relation to go further ( she is kinda a easy girl) exemples : when she was flirting with me I was trying to act like someone who is egocentric, all the things that would make me seem like a pick me boy. This is for clarifying, the atmosphere a this after was not normal, she was trying to twerk in front of us when her friends where not there. It’s not to antagonise her or smth it’s for adding some context because a lot of comments didn’t understand it fully	1b05uem	i touched this girl while i was drunk and i just cant live with it	i went to go on a party with my friends in another city in my country after the party we got to the house of a girl to sleep we continued to drink alcohol and this where it start the day after i woke up with no memory but my friends told me i touched this one girl i didnt understand at the first time but when they explained me they said this was not that bad just that i was trying to lay down and that i touched it while i was laying so i said i was sorry and that i will hate myself for that but weeks later she texted my friend to say that she was feeling bad about it and that she wasnt feeling good in her body because of that so when my friend told it to me i was really shocked so i texted her for trying to help her and myself because i cant stand to hurt poeple so i tried to manage things to make her feel good and i succeeded to do it but she told me that it was longer so i asked to my other friend who said it was not true so idk but i just feel shit about it and i truly hate myself for that can you say me how i have to feel about it i modified to explain some things so all the poeple at the party said that i just falled and my hand touched her vagina but i removed it a second after i have to say that i would not do it on purpose why  because this girl is not my type of girl because even before i met her i was always trying to disgust her because i didnt want our relation to go further  she is kinda a easy girl exemples  when she was flirting with me i was trying to act like someone who is egocentric all the things that would make me seem like a pick me boy this is for clarifying the atmosphere a this after was not normal she was trying to twerk in front of us when her friends where not there its not to antagonise her or smth its for adding some context because a lot of comments didnt understand it fully	buem
408	I bled all over a chair in school and didn't say anything	"I was in high school when I got my first period and I didn't notice when it started. I was wearing a skirt as part of my uniform and at the end of class I stood up and noticed the chair was covered in period blood. It was a dark chair and not too noticeable, I was so embarrassed and just pushed in the chair and went straight to the bathroom. I noticed that no blood got on my skirt as it was short enough to be out of the way when sitting. The blood also wasn't anywhere visible like down my legs or anything so I just stuck a pad down there, cleaned up a little and continued on with my day. To this day though, I still feel bad because there were 3 more classes in that room after me and I wonder if anyone sat down in my period blood. It was a really heavy flow too.

Edit: I'm sorry I said stuck a pad down there. I thought it was obvious I stuck it on my underwear. I literally know female anatomy because I AM A GIRL. The kilt has built in shorts, like a skort. I know what women's clothing is because I AM A GIRL. if you want to know what the kilt was like, look up Mccarthy uniform, that was where I bought my clothes for school. If you're going to say this is false please stop commenting, I've had enough hate already"	1azokfn	i bled all over a chair in school and didnt say anything	"i was in high school when i got my first period and i didnt notice when it started i was wearing a skirt as part of my uniform and at the end of class i stood up and noticed the chair was covered in period blood it was a dark chair and not too noticeable i was so embarrassed and just pushed in the chair and went straight to the bathroom i noticed that no blood got on my skirt as it was short enough to be out of the way when sitting the blood also wasnt anywhere visible like down my legs or anything so i just stuck a pad down there cleaned up a little and continued on with my day to this day though i still feel bad because there were  more classes in that room after me and i wonder if anyone sat down in my period blood it was a really heavy flow too

409	I accepted a counterfeit $100 bill at work... twice.	"In the 90s, I had a summer cashier job at a fast food restaurant. We were in a very family-oriented suburb and always busy. I remember we'd occasionally have a kid ball team come in after winning a game, and the coach would buy an ice cream cone for everyone and pay with a $50. 

I was kind of (naively) incredulous, seeing the big bills. Until then, the money I had exposure to until then was just from babysitting neighbors, like $5s and $10s. Or a $20 tucked in a birthday card. It was my first time handling larger denominations.

One summer day, a guy came into the store during a mid afternoon lull. White guy, early 50s, baseball hat, t-shirt and shorts. He looked like any regular suburban dad, swinging by after a trip to Home Depot or something.

He stood around a few minutes before stepping up the register. I assumed he was either deciding what to order or waiting for some to join him. He ordered a single ice cream cone with a really friendly manner, presenting a $100 with a flourish and a smile. 

When I felt the bill, I immediately knew it was fake. It was slippery smooth and thinner weight. He saw my flash of recognition that it was fake. He watched me intensely, to see what my reaction would be. I felt like he was challenging me to speak up. Like, ""Yeah? What are you going to do about it?"" 

I felt intimidated and nervous. I'd only worked there a couple weeks by then. I had no training for how to handle counterfeit money. We didn't even have one of those markers to test on the spot. 

After my brief fluster, I accepted the bill and counted out his $98.94 (or w/e) in change. His demeanor flipped from intimidating back to the friendly dad persona. I filled the cone and served it to him. As he left, I thought, ""Wow, that guy just walked in here with nothing and left with ice cream *and* $100.""

I knew fake money was illegal, but I didn't realize just *how* illegal. I didn't mention it to my managers. I was afraid that I'd be in trouble for not denying the purchase and accepting it. The register didn't have a section for big bills, so I hid it under the $20s. Truth be told, I forgot about it. 

A little while later, the guy came in again. I did not recognize him on sight. But when he handed me that slippery smooth $100 bill, I remembered him and the prior transaction. He didn't give me the intimidating look the second time. Probably he was comfortable with his 'mark' not addressing him. 

I wasn't even nervous the second time. I justified it by thinking, ""Nothing happened last time. This isn't my problem."" I just counted out his change and handed over the ice cream. 

A couple weeks later one of the managers mentioned that the cops had come into the store. He told us that counterfeit currency that was traced back to our store and to watch for anything suspicious. At that point, I hadn't even considered that money COULD be traced. 

Obviously the bank caught it when they did the deposit and passed it over to the cops. It had been more than two $100s I took. Thinking back over it now, I realized when the guy was hanging around before ordering, he was casing the place. Deliberately chose a teenage cashier, went at a quieter time to be in and out, and waited for my coworkers to be distracted. 

*Counterfeit currency* sounded a lot worse than *fake money.* Cops were now involved. I didn't want to be in trouble for passing counterfeit currency. I didn't want to admit it was me who had accepted it. I didn't want to explain why I didn't speak up. I said nothing.

410	On purpose I would drop my ice cream to make my parents buy me another	As a kid i have a vivid memory of me getting ice cream cones that my parents bought me and i would purposefully push the ice cream off the cone with my tongue and make it fall on to the ground. I would of course pretend as if it were an accident. After doing this i would then act very sad and as if the world was ending essentially to make my parents feel bad and most of the time they would end up asking the guy at the store for a new one or they would buy me another ice cream cone. I had reasonings as a kid for this though... I would only push the ice cream off the cone with my tongue once i was about 1/4th the way into eating my ice cream cone. This way when i would drop the ice cream to the ground and get a new one, i would have a total of 1 and 1/4 of an ice cream to myself. I feel extra bad because i would do this a lot when my father took me to sporting events in town and then would have to buy me two ice creams at an outrageous price they had them for sale at the game. Feel bad to this day, but that extra 1/4th of an ice cream made sense in my head logically.	1aypz2d	on purpose i would drop my ice cream to make my parents buy me another	as a kid i have a vivid memory of me getting ice cream cones that my parents bought me and i would purposefully push the ice cream off the cone with my tongue and make it fall on to the ground i would of course pretend as if it were an accident after doing this i would then act very sad and as if the world was ending essentially to make my parents feel bad and most of the time they would end up asking the guy at the store for a new one or they would buy me another ice cream cone i had reasonings as a kid for this though i would only push the ice cream off the cone with my tongue once i was about th the way into eating my ice cream cone this way when i would drop the ice cream to the ground and get a new one i would have a total of  and  of an ice cream to myself i feel extra bad because i would do this a lot when my father took me to sporting events in town and then would have to buy me two ice creams at an outrageous price they had them for sale at the game feel bad to this day but that extra th of an ice cream made sense in my head logically	aypzd
411	I was living in NYC and faked having cancer so I could move back home.	"I didn't have enough money to stay in New York City, and I didn't have enough money to leave New York City. 

I had just ended a 5 year relationship (he was cheating). I was grateful to end it and had just enough money to get my own apartment. 

Also: I kept having fibroids in my breasts, they were so painful. I was able to get a prophylactic mastectomy covered by my company's insurance plan, so I took it. My neighbor assumed I had breast cancer, after my surgery, and I never stopped her from thinking that. She never officially asked. But she took me under her wing, an older woman. I was between boyfriends and not close to my family. 

Well, that's when the lie started. I didn't stop her. I needed her - I felt so lost and alone. Then, I remember the first time the lie crossed my lips - I told a friend I had cancer - and she suggested I get treatment back at home, in Texas. I thought... could this be my justifiable reason for going back home? I was always afraid of what people thought of me if I returned home (""she couldn't hack it in New York, she failed""). 

I used the lie to move home. Moved back to Texas. Got an apartment for 1/5th the price I was paying in NYC. I cut off my long brown hair, cut it really short - pixie cut. People would ask about my losing hair, and I said no, that it doesn't happen to everyone. Of course it does - but somehow everyone in my life believed me. I'd ""fake"" doctor appointments so those closer to me thought I was getting treatment. 

That was almost 10 years ago. I still live in Texas and am married, with children. Having ""had cancer"" lives in my past, it rarely comes up today. Every opportunity I've had to donate / walk for breast cancer, I have. The guilt is very much present. 

No one in my life knows about this, not even my husband. He knows every single thing about me - except for this. It is kind of wild, typing this out, because I've never breathed these words out loud, to anyone.

I didn't realize that a little pressure would lift up off my shoulders. Don't get me wrong - still TONS of pressure - but I am feeling a little shift by sharing. PS. I've had 6 miscarriages and my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer (survived). Deep down in my heart, I feel as those both of those are because of this lie.

412	I embezzled with my coworkers from the grocery store we worked at	When I was 16 I worked for our local Stop & Shop. It was 1996 so there weren't any cameras. I worked behind the customer service desk and found out that we didn't account for the bottle slips. So when people redeemed them at the register we just rip them up at the end of the night. In my head I was thinking sweet I'll just enter into the register $5 and take the cash and go buy a sandwich on break. When I told my coworker friends they took it up a notch and said well why can't we just redeem $20 at a time and take the cash. It began a competition on who would take the most during a shift. Well I didn't know it at the time but a few more cashiers were doing this too but our influx of additional theft alerted the managers. There was a heavy uptick of bottle slip redemptions. So they ran a report and found all of us but could not prove it. There were no cameras, our drawers were always correct. All they had was that report of the redemptions. So we all got to quit with no charges pressed. To this day when I go in that store I feel so guilty and bad. I have not done anything like that since. 	1aybatd	i embezzled with my coworkers from the grocery store we worked at	when i was  i worked for our local stop  shop it was  so there werent any cameras i worked behind the customer service desk and found out that we didnt account for the bottle slips so when people redeemed them at the register we just rip them up at the end of the night in my head i was thinking sweet ill just enter into the register  and take the cash and go buy a sandwich on break when i told my coworker friends they took it up a notch and said well why cant we just redeem  at a time and take the cash it began a competition on who would take the most during a shift well i didnt know it at the time but a few more cashiers were doing this too but our influx of additional theft alerted the managers there was a heavy uptick of bottle slip redemptions so they ran a report and found all of us but could not prove it there were no cameras our drawers were always correct all they had was that report of the redemptions so we all got to quit with no charges pressed to this day when i go in that store i feel so guilty and bad i have not done anything like that since 	aybatd
413	I stole a bottle of water from a supermarket today	So I used to have a water bottle, but it broke yesterday and I literally have no money rn, to the point where I've been walking 1.5 h every day to go home from work because I don't even have money to take the bus. So I went to the supermarket and took a black marker with me. I grabbed a bottle of water, started walking around as if I was going to buy something else, and then in an empty aisle I scribbled over the barcode trying not to face any cameras. This is literally the first time I do something like this, and I'm just waiting to get paid at the end of the month, I'll pay off all my debts and I'm hoping everything will go back to normal because I've never been in a situation like this, I never thought I would have to steal a bottle of water just to be able to have some water, and I feel weird and guilty. Of course I'm not proud of this, but I really didn't know what else to do, it's the middle of the summer, it was past noon and I hadn't drank water all day	1ay7wci	i stole a bottle of water from a supermarket today	so i used to have a water bottle but it broke yesterday and i literally have no money rn to the point where ive been walking  h every day to go home from work because i dont even have money to take the bus so i went to the supermarket and took a black marker with me i grabbed a bottle of water started walking around as if i was going to buy something else and then in an empty aisle i scribbled over the barcode trying not to face any cameras this is literally the first time i do something like this and im just waiting to get paid at the end of the month ill pay off all my debts and im hoping everything will go back to normal because ive never been in a situation like this i never thought i would have to steal a bottle of water just to be able to have some water and i feel weird and guilty of course im not proud of this but i really didnt know what else to do its the middle of the summer it was past noon and i hadnt drank water all day	aywci
414	Used to remove the detachable part of clothing tags at stores	"If you've ever been to a clothing store (at least in the U.S.) you've probably seen that almost every item has a paper/cardboard tag attached to the item with what is usually a plastic string. At the end of the tag there's a little section at the bottom with the price.

Every summer, my mom used to take me (and my brother later on) to this huge strip mall a city over to shop in all these outlet stores to shop for clothes for the next school year. This affair usually took a whole day, morning till sunset, and it was an absolute drag. I was a little kid with no interest in shopping being carted around a very hot slab of concrete and asphalt while holding bags of clothes and shoe boxes. It wasn't common/normalized for kids to have phones yet, so I had to do the next best thing, which in my mind was to remove the bottom parts of the price tags of every article of clothing on a rack or in an aisle while my mom shopped.

In my criminal escapades, I was only caught once. It was in an Old Navy, where an older employee caught me in the act and sweetly told me to not do that. I was overwhelmed with guilt, not just because she went about it in such a nice way, but because the left front pocket of my shorts was already filled to the brim with these little paper rectangles, and I had probably desecrated a quarter of the store's apparel by then.

Eventually the pandemic hit, and a lot of our shopping moved online, so my days as a career criminal came to a natural conclusion. Recently, my parents and I went on another shopping spree on my accord for my 18th birthday. We went to an Old Navy and while we were there, I saw the price tags and was flooded with mixed yet surprisingly strong emotions.

I don't know the extent to which I could have caused damage to the stores involved. I don't quite care for how I could have possibly hurt the big department stores, but the idea that I might have made retail workers' jobs harder in my boredom does stir up guilt."	1axai75	used to remove the detachable part of clothing tags at stores	"if youve ever been to a clothing store at least in the us youve probably seen that almost every item has a papercardboard tag attached to the item with what is usually a plastic string at the end of the tag theres a little section at the bottom with the price

417	I stole from a company and I extorted other people who stole	"When I (M30) was 23-25 years old I worked in a sports arena and stadium for the same company. I sound and look very professional so in about 1 months time they started giving me the position of interim stand manager, meaning that I would perform as an assistant to a supervisor or basically run the stand and manage the other employees. 

I was also a cashier and at the end of the events we use a key to unlock the registers. I was such a trusted employee that I would be in charge of the register key at the end of the event. One time the supervisor forgot to get the key back from me and that's how it all began. 

Ways I stole: when someone would make an order and it was possible to give them the exact change in bills I would act like I'm ringing them up, do the math, and put the cash under the money tray in the register. The only way to open the register is to either ring someone up or use the key, so obviously I would use the key to open the register. When I was in a stand that had cameras I would loan out the key to a friend who was at a stand with no cameras so they could perform the theft and we would arrange how much money they would give me at the end of the night. 

Ways I extorted: as an interim stand manager I would sometimes catch people stealing. Then I would go up to them and let them know that if they didn't give me x amount of money I was going to report them. Sometimes they would be reluctant but I'm 6'2 and 180 pounds. Occasionally when they would be reluctant I would let them know I would catch them after the  event when they're walking to the parking lot and if that occurred then I would take ALL the money.  Keep in mind the arena had a metal detector. I had a gold knife attached to my belt buckle on the inside of my pants so when they checked me they always assumed it was my belt buckle that was being detected. Occasionally I would have to show the thief what I had but I never let them see where I took the knife from because then I would be exposed.

Also, when I was stand manager for football games I worked on the first floor right next to what is equivalent to a vip section (its been some years so I forgot the exact term). Think about it: only people with hefty pockets can afford to be ground level at a professional sports stadium. They gave great tips and I was the only cashier so they would give the tips to me. At the end of the event I would have usually around $200 in tips. The prep workers expected tips and it was usually about 3 or 4 of them. I would give them about $3-$5 dollars at the end of the event and keep the rest for myself. The company didn't pay me more to be an interim stand manager so I made sure to pay myself. At the beginning and end of the events I would do inventory and bookkeeping which the preps didn't have to do. So fuck the preps I want all the money.

also when i was stand manager for football games i worked on the first floor right next to what is equivalent to a vip section its been some years so i forgot the exact term think about it only people with hefty pockets can afford to be ground level at a professional sports stadium they gave great tips and i was the only cashier so they would give the tips to me at the end of the event i would have usually around  in tips the prep workers expected tips and it was usually about  or  of them i would give them about  dollars at the end of the event and keep the rest for myself the company didnt pay me more to be an interim stand manager so i made sure to pay myself at the beginning and end of the events i would do inventory and bookkeeping which the preps didnt have to do so fuck the preps i want all the money 

i know im an asshole"	avxuk
418	i tried to poison my friend every day at lunch as a kid	"when i was in fifth grade, i wanted to kill my best friend for some reason. His name was Larry and he had this bowl cut that i just absolutely despised even though it didn’t bother me directly, i just hated it - so one day i was like, yeah, im gonna murder him! there was this one kid named Nick in on it as well, we never talked before so i don’t even know how we got the idea to just slowly kill Larry, we would steal chalk from the teacher and dump it into Larry’s Spiderman water jug, it was a thermos so it wasn’t the transparent kind. 

We did this everyday at lunch, we would do small amounts as to not make it obvious, and everyday Larry would feel sick not knowing why. 

One day, we decided to add more chalk (like a shit ton) than we usually would into his jug to see what would happen, and at lunch, he was basically vomiting his guts out, it was all multicoloured and stuff because of the chalk colours. Me and nick were laughing our asses off and Larry realized whats been going on and snitched to the teacher, but me and nick had a plan. There was this one really weird kid named Sean and everyone knew that he liked mixing chalk into his water bottle, And Sean just so happens to sit beside Larry. So we blamed Sean and Sean got sent into the principals office, After that, Sean got transferred into a different classroom and he was never allowed to leave the room at lunch again. We would just see Sean looking sadly outside the window at lunch from his classroom all alone eating his lunchables. Im so sorry Sean you were a nice dude

419	Peanut butter revenge for friend stealing my undertale picture	When i was 12 i was really obsessed with undertale but my skank mom called up the school and said it was to violent. My teacher wouldnt let me talk about it anymore even though it was a special ed class so she should have known it was my hyperfixation, and that undertale is not violent. I of course continued on with my obsession and drew a picture of it in lunch once and my friend tried taking it from me to take to the teacher and he ran away from me as i chased him through the lunch beams and tables i caught him a choke hold and then he lied to the teacher saying he did nothing wrong so my best friend and i planned to off him with peanut butter as he was allergic  and use gloves while doing it. we never did it of course but we had a whole plan to sneak it in his food . I told my bus friend and she never sat by me again.

420	The web of lies - I drop out of every degree course and nobody knows	"So...  
I've started uni quite a few years ago. After 1st year and during pandemic i decided to change my field of study, starting a new one. Then I decided to keep that to myself for as long as possible, as my family is very strict about learning and me getting a degree. I hope this will help everybody visualize better:  
Year 1 - 1st degree course, dropped out because it wasn't really interesting for me  
Year 2 - I got into new university, started new degree couse, but due to pandemic and severe lack of willpower to study i dropped out again.  
Year 3 - I decided to start the same degree course anew, i told nobody from my family, but someone found out because of letter that they opened.  
Year 4 - I continued the course, but dropped out because of  anxiety i guess? I just couldn't keep up with the pressure.  
Year 5 - I should be writing my Bachelor Thesis (and that's what everybody is thinking), but i started a new degree course.  
All that time i've been lying to my family, friends and my wonderful girlfriend. I really don't know how to get out of that spiral of lies. I feel constant fear about the need to come clean and what will they say. I don't really have greatest connection with my parents - they pay for my life and expect me to get a degree. I think I should go see a psychologist, but i know that this won't help with the consequences. I know I deserve them, but I can't lose my partner- she is everything that is worth living for."	1avtm9a	the web of lies  i drop out of every degree course and nobody knows	"so

421	Shot a potato gun at the Russian mafia. Framed my dad. 	"When I was 12 my older brother and I were playing with the potato gun he made to look like actual military hardware. My dad came out to check on us just as our potato sailed past the target and over the fence of our neighbors gaudy mansion. It rocked an suv that was pulling out of the driveway containing our neighbor who was a Russian mobster hiding in the states from the Russian government. We threw the potato gun to mad dad and ran inside just as several bodyguards jumped out of the car reaching under their clothes presumably for guns. So my dad had a mini faceoff with mob goons while he stood there with a smoking tube/bazooka looking toy. 
Nothing happened because they needed to keep living in this community…. 
Then a few years later the mob family fled in the night, abandoned the house, and the mob dad was eventually found murdered in Colorado. So of course I shot out all the windows with my BB gun, the abandon mansion next door."	1avnuww	shot a potato gun at the russian mafia framed my dad 	"when i was  my older brother and i were playing with the potato gun he made to look like actual military hardware my dad came out to check on us just as our potato sailed past the target and over the fence of our neighbors gaudy mansion it rocked an suv that was pulling out of the driveway containing our neighbor who was a russian mobster hiding in the states from the russian government we threw the potato gun to mad dad and ran inside just as several bodyguards jumped out of the car reaching under their clothes presumably for guns so my dad had a mini faceoff with mob goons while he stood there with a smoking tubebazooka looking toy

422	When I was 10 i threw a rock at a moving car and then I run away	"Basically, what I was trying to do was get a perfect throw in between road and below car body as car was moving so that the rock would come out on the other side...

 I don't know why I even wanted to do that, we were playing something totally unrelated on the playground, and as the car was coming by thought of rock throwing just instantly appeared in my mind.... Then I picked up first rock I saw and threw it... 

It ended up hitting the passenger door quote loudly and car came to a stop. It was then that I saw that driver was a minority person which I only later realized it has deeper meaning..

Sure we were kids and I just run away, but what bugs me this whole time is the fact that the driver must have felt really bad...

423	I've yelled at and closed my 3 mo old's mouth to not lose it	"i feel guilty for this and i KNOW i need to go back to therapy, but until then I need to just need to get this off my chest and kind advice too. 

my daughter's crying is a guttural scream that makes me tense up all the way like im being dragged to hell. multiple times, i've yelled or raised my voice towards her or at her in the midst of this because i feel like im actually going to explode. i have scary intrusive thoughts i know i wont do but the PPD makes me feel like im stuck for life. like she's only 3 months and im losing it and i dont know if i really will get better. 

i was SO happy before having her and now i feel like her existence will drain everything out of me even though i did want her. her dad left us when i was pregnant with her and he was emotionally abusive as well. there weren't red flags in the beginning. i gave a sweet nice guy a chance only to find out he actually is a menace to many women and i feel so stupid. he calls me names, rubs in my face i dont have what he has materialistically, and just overall a mean person. 

i wish i didnt have breaking points so i can be everything to my baby. i kept her because once i heard the heartbeat at about 8weeks , i knew in my heart she was meant to exist and we were meant to be together. but PPD has been ruining it for me. I feel bad for my daughter for having a depressed mom. i feel bad because i believe that all of the hard therapy work , subconscious reprogramming, journaling, prayer, meditation, yoga, venting, church, and more has been for nothing. im still a horrible person who's trauma's get triggered. everyone around me and online seems like they have it together. ive yelled at her at least 5 times and i swore i'd never be like my adoptive and biological parents with the abuse.... now i feel like im down a nasty road. i hope things change 
 
Update;
Thank you for you kind messages and suggestions too. Even though it's only been about a day since I've posted this confession, I've talked to a lot of family & friends, I'm going to my doctor to be prescribed medication again, and I've implemented some of the coping mechanisms you all have suggested like the earphones with music (she likes Pierce the Veil too), stepping out for 10-15 minutes (it was HARD because i know she just wants a hug but being overstimulated is not good for me), crying (i cried a lot. i didnt realize how much sadness was actually behind that anger especially the betrayal i faced dealing with her biological father), take note of what phase of anger im in to dictate my wellbeing, a daycare tour is set, and talking it out. Never would I have expected this to blow up the way that it did, but I'm glad it did. Before I was pregnant I was a completely different person.  The one to advocate for children's safety and care, but it all changed when I gave birth and had a traumatic stay due to preeclampsia, as lovely as the hospital staff were to me and my family. 
I know some people will see this post and automatically assume I'm the devil but hey, at least i was honest about my struggles and not hiding it. To be honest seeing the way some people called me a shit mother and telling me to give my baby up for dealing with postpartum gave me the boost to not give up as depressed as i may be. call it pride or ego, idc. ive always wanted to be a mother and im not letting PPD win especially some folks who have 0 idea what this actually is. I get you care about a child's safety too though so I respect it in a way. 
Anyways, I may or may not update this post later once I'm on my medication for a consistent amount of time. But I hope this post gives everyone who has dealt with PPD either first hand or witness or even heard of it, to reach out for help and reach out to help others as well. this is real life and shouldn't be a taboo topic. The more shame is thrown at people like me the less likely they will receive help and that is very true all across the board for any problems in life. 💕 "	1avb2u0	ive yelled at and closed my  mo olds mouth to not lose it	"i feel guilty for this and i know i need to go back to therapy but until then i need to just need to get this off my chest and kind advice too

424	When I was in elementary school I vandalized new construction for a neighborhood.	"I grew up in New Jersey in a neighborhood behind a farm with cows. The pasture had a part that was down hill to our home and every winter we would sled down that hill. A couple of years before my parents divorced and we moved away, the farm was sold and they were building new homes on the pasture. My friend and I would go play on the construction equipment when no one was there.
One day we did something different, we pulled out all of the stakes in the ground. Every single one of them. I learned later that was for the surveying of the utilities and future neighborhood streets. Letters went out to everyone in our neighborhood seeking information on who did it, with a $500 reward.
We kept our mouths shut and I never went back there again. It was funny to see the reactions of my older brother and mother when I spilled the beans 30 years later when reminiscing about that house and neighborhood during a family dinner. The middle child had a delinquent side."	1av7egd	when i was in elementary school i vandalized new construction for a neighborhood	"i grew up in new jersey in a neighborhood behind a farm with cows the pasture had a part that was down hill to our home and every winter we would sled down that hill a couple of years before my parents divorced and we moved away the farm was sold and they were building new homes on the pasture my friend and i would go play on the construction equipment when no one was there

426	"In 2008 I named my teacher "" Luigi "" and to this day everyone calls him that"	"Back in 2008 I saw this teacher Im like omg its Luigi and everybody thought he really looked like him. It became a thing and it started from a harmless prank to disrespect when they started to call him Luigi in the middle of the class or when he enters he finds the name Luigi written on the board and sometimes a drawing of the teacher as Luigi, he hated it bad he was furious

2 guys from the other grades got suspended cause he caught them calling him Luigi, The school wrote this on the anouncement board ""We know that some students gave a nickname to a certain teacher we are working to determine who did this, We won't tolerate this behaviour and anyone who do this will get suspended and/or expelled"". When I saw it I was trembling with fear cause they can easily make their way to me if any of my classmates talk. I was right to be afraid cause not only they made it to my class but narrowed it to only 4 \[me and 3 friends\] with the help of an ""anonymous tip"" ( it was the daughter of another teacher we all knew she would talk). None of us said anything cause we were all in this together, if they say Im the one who came up with the name I will tell them they are the ones behind the drawings. They asked us to bring a parent tommorow, I wanted to bring my father since he is nicer but he refused so my mom went with me, I told her that they think one of us 4 did it but Im innocent and my mom got so angry. She went there and started a fight yelling at the principal the teacher Luigi and everyone there: My baby would never do this I know him well he never got in any problem..... its your fault for making my son sit in the back of the class now he will always be accused of anything that happens cause he sits there. The other parents didn't get to say a word, Omg I was so happy my 3 friends didn't tell the truth. After this everyone in the school calls him Luigi even outside, they see his car and they start screaming Luigi Luigi.

Edit : Forgot to mention that I met one of my friends last month and he told me that there are rumors Luigi might become a principal

429	I abused my friends and family because of my emotional issues	"For context, Im a 26 year old male on the autism spectrum, and all throughout my life I've treated the ones I love like actual trash without realizing it until now. I sort of always knew to SOME extent subconsciously, but now its gotten to the point where I've burnt so many bridges and hurt so many people that I've more or less realized I'M the problem and am generally a very bad person.  


Most of this stems not only from my autism and how it makes me struggle socially, but also all the trauma and trust issues I've developed from my abusive childhood. Most of the bridges I've burnt stem from me accusing the other person of doing XYZ out of paranoia, showing extreme distrust and overall just constantly feeling like everyone is out to get me.  


It doesn't matter how close someone gets to me and how good they treat me, I always end up thinking one day they'll secretly backstab me and then I sabotage everything because my paranoia has to fuck everything up. My friends and family can't even ask me simple questions without me getting extremely defensive and/or aggressive because im so afraid of being hurt, only to now realize I was hurting myself anyway.

It wasn't because I had any ill will toward the owner or anything like that, I didn't even know who they were. I was just bored and looking for something to do.

  
At the time, I didn't fully grasp the consequences of my actions. I thought it was just a harmless prank. But looking back now, after serving in the Army myself, I realize just what havoc I must have brought to this poor guys life. I could not imagine have to call my 1stSgt multiple times with the exact same story of having 4 flats with the valve stems missing.

  
I never got caught, but I have thought about that poor soldier on more than one occasion, and thought to myself how could I have been such a little asshole.

  
To whoever owned that car, I am truly sorry for what I did. I hope you never had to face any serious consequences because of my actions."	1atkp3c	as a yearold i used to pull valve stems from car tires on my way to school	"every morning on my way to school i would pass by this car parked on the street for some reason i got this twisted thrill out of messing with it so one day i decided to remove the valve stems from all four tires and continued doing it at random it wasnt because i had any ill will toward the owner or anything like that i didnt even know who they were i was just bored and looking for something to do

431	I was a panhandler/hitchhiker for most of my teen years	"From the ages 14-22 I only panhandled to survive. 
Once my dad stop paying child support my family and I became homeless. There were many days we were at the point of starvation until I decided to panhandle. At first I only did it so we could have one meal a day buy as I realized I could get much more it eventually kinda became like a job and we used the money to check into a cheap hotel every night. 

I was fine with it at first because I felt like I was helping my family survive but my mother refused to get a job and didn't want my brother and I to work either. My brother is 6 years older so he was already an adult at this time. My mother told me that she had a search warrant for her arrest so if she got a job the cops will find her and arrest her. I found out years later that it wasn't true (I believed her for like 5 years). 

We spent years just going from town to town, state to state doing the same thing and I would be the only person panhandling. My family never did because apparently ""people would have more sympathy for the youngest person"". I was a very obedient child so it never crossed my mind to rebel until I was 22. 

My mother ended up winning a lawsuit with someone and got a few thousand and we spent it living in airbnbs. I enjoyed not feeling homeless or asking anyone for anything so much that I decided to finally rebel and just get a job so I could continue that lifestyle.  My mother was very upset by this and it wasn't easy at all for me because of how much she gaslit me but I finally did it. 

At 22 years old I had no education or work experience so it was hard at first but now a couple of years later I'm living normally but still support my family financially. Panhandling has cost me lots of psychological trauma and my self esteem is at 0. I also don't know how I can ever stop supporting my family because they wouldn't have anywhere to live if I did. I love them very much but they are toxic. 

This is something I would never tell anyone that I meet because I'm so ashamed of my past and looking back really wished I had it in me to rebel much sooner because by now my life would've been better and i feel really depressed that I wasted my youth."	1as2my6	i was a panhandlerhitchhiker for most of my teen years	"from the ages  i only panhandled to survive

432	I threw a rock at a teachers car and never got in trouble.	When I was in elementary school, I was being a dumb little kid and decided it would be a wise choice to throw a rock as high as I could up into the air next to my playground. Of course our playground was right next to the teacher parking lot, so you can guess the rest. It slammed on either the hood or windshield of a teachers car making a loud thud. Their was a long path between the door to the school and the playground, and I was walking alone. I immediately looked to see no witnesses and then I just kept walking. Still feel bad about it today at 19. I'm honestly surprised I never got in trouble, because even then our school had security cameras.	1as196w	i threw a rock at a teachers car and never got in trouble	when i was in elementary school i was being a dumb little kid and decided it would be a wise choice to throw a rock as high as i could up into the air next to my playground of course our playground was right next to the teacher parking lot so you can guess the rest it slammed on either the hood or windshield of a teachers car making a loud thud their was a long path between the door to the school and the playground and i was walking alone i immediately looked to see no witnesses and then i just kept walking still feel bad about it today at  im honestly surprised i never got in trouble because even then our school had security cameras	asw
433	Cashier mistake leads to me paying next to nothing for two carts of groceries	The other day I went grocery shopping at a local chain grocery store. I had two full carts of food as I don’t have a car so I try to do as much as I can in one trip. I got to the check out and before the first cart was empty my total was over 200. I didn’t look again and kept unloading. Well at the end of the second cart the cashier paused the transaction so they could catch up with bagging and make room for more. During that time there was a shift change. The new cashier was told by the original about the pause. But she forgot and started scanning the rest of my groceries as a new transaction. I saw it happen and didn’t say anything. I ended up only paying $98 for two carts of food. I’ve really been struggling so this seemed to be a huge blessing in my favor but now I can’t help but wonder if I got someone in trouble or worse fired.	1arylww	cashier mistake leads to me paying next to nothing for two carts of groceries	the other day i went grocery shopping at a local chain grocery store i had two full carts of food as i dont have a car so i try to do as much as i can in one trip i got to the check out and before the first cart was empty my total was over  i didnt look again and kept unloading well at the end of the second cart the cashier paused the transaction so they could catch up with bagging and make room for more during that time there was a shift change the new cashier was told by the original about the pause but she forgot and started scanning the rest of my groceries as a new transaction i saw it happen and didnt say anything i ended up only paying  for two carts of food ive really been struggling so this seemed to be a huge blessing in my favor but now i cant help but wonder if i got someone in trouble or worse fired	arylww
434	I befriended and used a guy in order go to a frat party.	"I was in undergrad and I wasn't in a fraternity. I heard that this massive and wealthy fraternity was throwing a party and I knew all the hot sorority girls would be there.

There was a guy in my class who was a member, he was cool but a little awkward. I struck up a conversation with him and consistently focused on engaging him. My plan was to have him invite me, he eventually did and I went.

I proceeded to go to the party and I had a great time. Problem was I ignored my ""friend"" all night and focused on talking to ladies. He later called me out on this and we stopped talking. It's been a few years and I feel bad, I just was an amoral scumbag at the time and didn't care about his feelings.

I did get this cute woman's number though so that was cool. I ended up ghosting her since she wanted to go on a date before sex.

435	I was going to off myself the night I got a DUI and I have never told anyone. 	"TRIGGER WARNING (THIS INVOLVES THE DEATH OF SOMEONE, DRUGS, AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITES)

So long story short, had a serious drug problem at 16-19 and family didn’t know about it. (Very few friends did and even they didn’t know the extent of it.) 

I got the news about 6pm on June 30th that my best friend and my godson (she was pregnant) had died. Later that night I found that her fiancé was drunk and wouldn’t let her drive. He hit another pregnant lady driving head on (she gave birth that night). My best friend was 17 at the time and did not want her father to be mad about curfew, so she let him drive. I happened to be in love with her and we had dated on and off for 5 years, known her since the 2nd grade. 

Anyways so at 6pm im in my car waiting on my friends to get alcohol from walmart when I got the call. (We were going to a party). I told them and they asked if we were still going, to which i replied why not. This is where I had my first 4 loco. 5 of them to be exact. 1 when we left the party to take her and some extra friends home. She begged me to take them home and i said no, but I let my dick do the talking and yeah…. Got 2 of them home and had to make 1 more stop 45 miles away because they didnt tell me it was in another freaking county. 

Well on the way back from the last stop I happened to know of a large damned reservoir that would be easy to drive into. It was fairly deep and considering how fucked up the night went, I was ready. 

A little background. Parents are divorced for 12 years at this point, they were still in a custody battle over me, step dad died a couple years prior (he was my dad in many ways and i still call him dad to this day), and I was just starting college on my own with little to no support. 

On the way to the last drop off for the night, I was on a curvy road and couldn’t keep the car in the lane. Thats when I got pulled over. I was 18 and had 17 years olds in the car so it was a really big deal. I thank god all the time for that DUI because without it, I would be with my best friend and nephew. (Physically at the bottom of a lake though) 

I dont know if this is too dark for this sub bc everyone always talks about the pair of scissors they stole when they were 4 (p.s. I stole a pair of scissors when I was 4 and have felt endless regret to the old lady who smiled at me on the way out of the door) or the dollar bill they picked up off the street(did not do this, it was a bus floor), but it feels good to get this off of my chest.

436	When I was 10 I stole all the glue and scissors from my school and blamed someone else. They were seen as a trouble maker from then on.	"I was pretty popular at my school when I joined. Life was good until a new kid arrived when I was about 9. I don’t know how but over a really short time he managed to take over my friends’ group and push me out. 

Unrelated to this, one day I thought it would be funny to steal the glue and scissors, which I did. I was planning to return them after the amusement had been had, only the teacher went mad. They were being way over the top and they decided that if someone didn’t own up to it everyone would suffer. The class was starting to get really worried and were basically saying that whoever did it should just own up.

I stayed quiet and the teacher searched all our lockers and belongings. They found the glue and scissors in the locker of the new kid. I’d put them there originally as the locker was open, I didn’t even realise at the time it was his locker. But when the teacher found them I stayed quiet thinking that the worst that would happen was that they’d get a minor telling off. Only the teacher was being ridiculous and was still really angry. They went crazy at the boy and no matter how much he said it wasn’t him the teacher just kept going crazy. Eventually, the teacher took him to see the deputy head, the boy was in tears. His parents were called and he ended up in detention for a week. I felt pretty awful that I hadn’t said anything but I thought it was too late.

I’m in a WhatsApp group with old school friends and they were talking about random people when they mentioned the kid I blamed all those years ago. They were talking about how he was always such a dick.  I can’t stop thinking that maybe he wasn’t actually a dick but I kicked off his life of being labelled a dick by blaming that whole episode on him. It’s too late now but it was definitely a shitty thing to do even if I was 10."	1ark2hx	when i was  i stole all the glue and scissors from my school and blamed someone else they were seen as a trouble maker from then on	"i was pretty popular at my school when i joined life was good until a new kid arrived when i was about  i dont know how but over a really short time he managed to take over my friends group and push me out

437	When i was 12, I sold the Ritalin that my doctor prescribed me and used the money for alcohol, weed or other stuff...	"I was diagnosed with ADD (like ADHS without the H) when I was 12 years old. The psychiatrist prescribed Ritalin, which I also took. I received a pack of 100 per month (3x 40mg per day). It was payed my (dads) health insureance. One pack would have been like 250$.

At some point I started to open the capsules and crush the fine grains inside with two shot glasses and then snorted the powder out of curiosity.

When I realized how relativ strong (i guess it was like weak mdma or so, never took it) the effect was, I showed it to my friends. We started taking it almost every weekend, then daily at school (later work) or in the evening when we were outside.

Over time, others noticed it and wanted it too. From then on I started selling it at a completely overpriced price (1 pill = ~$20-30) and made a lot of money with it. Some times I even selld it pregrinded and slightly punched with white snuff (this menthol stuff) for an easy 50$ per gram.

There was nothing else around besides weed or hash and cocain was obioulsy to hard and barely available for kids my age.

I just went to the psychiatrist to get the prescription. He was partially surprised at how much I needed and asked for it, so I reduced the amount so it wouldn't be noticeable.

At that time I was already 16 or 17 and took it every day. It helped me a lot to get through the day without forgetting everything and dreaming away 24/7. Swallowing the pill had no effects anymore.

At some point there were people in my circle who were dealing with harder stuff, this made me aware of what I was actually doing and afraid/paranoid about getting caught so I just stopped doing it.

To this day no one except my old friends knows that I did that.

Oh yeah, I mainly used the money for alcohol (which I always had a former heroin addict buy for me ), weed, food, clothes or games.  Even if my family wasnt poor, no we lived in a house, my dad never brough me the stuff i wanted, not that i wanted much but for exp I needed new pants. I really wanted to wear hip-hop fashion but no, my father forced me to go to a men's clothing store (because I was fat and my size wasn't available in the children's/youth department). But I just wanted cool, wide pants from Pelle Pelle or Ecko, which were much cheaper, but no, he forced me into these old-fashioned clothes. I always had to lie to him about where I got the things, tell him friends didn't need them anymore, or change clothes at a friend's house before we went out."	1ar396y	when i was  i sold the ritalin that my doctor prescribed me and used the money for alcohol weed or other stuff	"i was diagnosed with add like adhs without the h when i was  years old the psychiatrist prescribed ritalin which i also took i received a pack of  per month x mg per day it was payed my dads health insureance one pack would have been like

439	When I was in Pre-K my teacher held down a student and let each of us hit him.	I was thinking back about my childhood and I have this very clear memory. When I was in Pre-K we had this very troubled kid. He’d bully us, steal from us, he’d hit some of the other students as well. All around bad kid. I remember one day my teacher had enough  and she held him down, lined us all up and told us we could hit him once. One by one in line we each had our turn to punch, slap, or kick the kid. I remember this vividly because I remember getting in trouble for kicking him twice. Even though it was 20 years ago I was just thinking about this and how fucked up and illegal it was. That kid was awful but he didn’t deserve that. I wonder if he remembers that day too.	1aqq8gf	when i was in prek my teacher held down a student and let each of us hit him	i was thinking back about my childhood and i have this very clear memory when i was in prek we had this very troubled kid hed bully us steal from us hed hit some of the other students as well all around bad kid i remember one day my teacher had enough  and she held him down lined us all up and told us we could hit him once one by one in line we each had our turn to punch slap or kick the kid i remember this vividly because i remember getting in trouble for kicking him twice even though it was  years ago i was just thinking about this and how fucked up and illegal it was that kid was awful but he didnt deserve that i wonder if he remembers that day too	aqqgf
440	I lied about being vegetarian all throughout middle school	"
So this all started in my first year at middle school some years ago. I wanted to be a ✨️new person✨️ and told everyone that I was going to be vegetarian from that day onward. It lasted about a month. As time continued, I felt guilty wasting the meat rather than eating it. So instead I went back to eating meat.. But I already told everyone I'm vegetarian so my great idea was to eat it in secret. Now imagine the scene from the 'I think you should leave' show where Tim Robinson ate that Hotdog out of his sleeve. That was exactly what I did. I would sneak full breakfast sausages up my sleeve, sit there ""pondering"" with my mouth placed on my hand sneaking nibbles of this sausage. And this lasted my entire middle school. I'd be surprised if no one noticed."	1aqeojx	i lied about being vegetarian all throughout middle school	"

442	I got my friends friend kicked out of a party in college	"The year was 2011 and i was visiting my friend, lets call him Ryan, at his college for an extended weekend, it was a great time overall and i got to meet a lot of his college friends. We went to a handful of parties, and this one in particular was at a frat house. Ryan was friends with some of the frat brothers, so we got to the house early to pre game and hang out with everyone. I some how got put in charge of the jungle juice container, everytime i had to be refilled i would bring it from the basement to the kitchen and then back down. 

To give you an idea of just how much 19 year old me was drinking, i had probably had about 10 shots while pregaming, then the jungle juice trips, i would just scoop my cup into the mix while they were making it, and there was also a keg. So yes, i was very very drunk. The theme of the party was ""boxer bros and panty hoe's"". So the guys were in basically t shirts and boxers or pajama pants and the girls were pretty much all in bra's and panties.

&#x200B;

Anyway, at one point i found myself unable to physically carry the jungle juice container anymore and was relieved of my duty. So i started talking to this girl and dancing with her, while she was grinding on me i puked all over her back side and in her hair, couldn't hold it in, not that i had much of a warning to myself, it just came out, and a lot of it. I then started stumbling all around this house puking everywhere, any cup or flower pot i could find, behind a chair, maybe under a coffee table. I puked everywhere, like a dog marking its territory. 

&#x200B;

I made my way upstair to the calmer area of the party, and saw Ryans friend Jay, sitting on one of the couches, so i went over to him and sat down. A few minutes into us talking, Jay picks up his solo cup and throws up/burps up beer into it and puts it down on the coffee table. One of the frat brothers comes storming over to us and starts yelling at jay that he has to leave because hes the one throwing up all over the place. They kick him out, and i start to try and defend him saying he wasn't that drunk and they need to calm down.  I was quickly booted as well. 

&#x200B;

I somehow snuck back into the frat house and got Ryan to leave the party with me and Jay and we went back to the campus and to their dorms and smoked a joint and passed out. To this day Ryan and Jay have no idea i am the reason we had to leave.

to give you an idea of just how much  year old me was drinking i had probably had about  shots while pregaming then the jungle juice trips i would just scoop my cup into the mix while they were making it and there was also a keg so yes i was very very drunk the theme of the party was boxer bros and panty hoes so the guys were in basically t shirts and boxers or pajama pants and the girls were pretty much all in bras and panties

xb

anyway at one point i found myself unable to physically carry the jungle juice container anymore and was relieved of my duty so i started talking to this girl and dancing with her while she was grinding on me i puked all over her back side and in her hair couldnt hold it in not that i had much of a warning to myself it just came out and a lot of it i then started stumbling all around this house puking everywhere any cup or flower pot i could find behind a chair maybe under a coffee table i puked everywhere like a dog marking its territory 

xb

i made my way upstair to the calmer area of the party and saw ryans friend jay sitting on one of the couches so i went over to him and sat down a few minutes into us talking jay picks up his solo cup and throws upburps up beer into it and puts it down on the coffee table one of the frat brothers comes storming over to us and starts yelling at jay that he has to leave because hes the one throwing up all over the place they kick him out and i start to try and defend him saying he wasnt that drunk and they need to calm down  i was quickly booted as well 

xb

i somehow snuck back into the frat house and got ryan to leave the party with me and jay and we went back to the campus and to their dorms and smoked a joint and passed out to this day ryan and jay have no idea i am the reason we had to leave  "	apmo
443	I stole money from my dad when I was 14 and I‘m not proud of it	"I really don‘t know how to start this… sooo when I was younger, I actually copied everything what my friends did. I didn‘t have an opinion and my only goal always was to fit in. I was so scared of rejection, that I didn‘t see any other way to behave like them. 
One day my best friend laughed about my old shoes, she asked me if I had found them in the trash, it felt like my whole appearance, that what I always what I always wanted to be, was destroyed.
I knew my father was stingy and wouldn’t understand why I would need the money. Later, when he was in his office, I seized the opportunity and took his wallet next to his bed. I took 85 euros and bought new shoes. I still feel so bad about it and I‘m not brave enough to confess him the story."	1aom7q1	i stole money from my dad when i was  and im not proud of it	"i really dont know how to start this sooo when i was younger i actually copied everything what my friends did i didnt have an opinion and my only goal always was to fit in i was so scared of rejection that i didnt see any other way to behave like them

444	I made a girl fail a test in middle school because of what she said about me.	For context, I have a less severe case of mobius syndrome. So in middle school, we had swapped seats and I sat next to this girl Jolie. Her friend Stacy sat behind us. (Fake names.) We had moved seats and her friend started to talk to her. Stacy thought she was whispering but I heard everything. She had said that she felt bad for Jolie. Stacy then said that she was sitting next to me “the weird looking kid”. So I knew I had to get revenge. For some more context, everytime we would have a test in this class, the teacher would come around and check our desks to see if we had any study guides with us. We weren’t allowed them and our teacher had stated that if we were caught with one it was a automatic fail. So the next time we had a test, I snuck a study guide in Stacy’s desk and waited. When the teacher came around to Stacy’s desk she had found the study guide. Stacy tried to tell her it wasn’t hers but the teacher wasn’t having it. She made her sit off to the side and failed her for the test. Stacy was crying and at the time I was laughing in my head. Do I feel bad about it now? Yes a bit.	1aojypn	i made a girl fail a test in middle school because of what she said about me	for context i have a less severe case of mobius syndrome so in middle school we had swapped seats and i sat next to this girl jolie her friend stacy sat behind us fake names we had moved seats and her friend started to talk to her stacy thought she was whispering but i heard everything she had said that she felt bad for jolie stacy then said that she was sitting next to me the weird looking kid so i knew i had to get revenge for some more context everytime we would have a test in this class the teacher would come around and check our desks to see if we had any study guides with us we werent allowed them and our teacher had stated that if we were caught with one it was a automatic fail so the next time we had a test i snuck a study guide in stacys desk and waited when the teacher came around to stacys desk she had found the study guide stacy tried to tell her it wasnt hers but the teacher wasnt having it she made her sit off to the side and failed her for the test stacy was crying and at the time i was laughing in my head do i feel bad about it now yes a bit	aojypn
445	I listened in on a private mobile phone call between someone I knew and their friend.	"I intercepted a mobile phone call between two people and one happened to be someone I knew and she was talking about me.

To be clear, this was back when mobile phones were analogue and you could use a scanner to scan for calls. And to be VERY clear, I only did this twice and for a couple of minutes. I felt guilty and realised it was an invasion of privacy and never did it after that.

I was also young and stupid. Nowadays I take privacy extremely seriously."	1ao1eed	i listened in on a private mobile phone call between someone i knew and their friend	"i intercepted a mobile phone call between two people and one happened to be someone i knew and she was talking about me

446	I Manipulated and Lied to My Mom and a Bunch of Family	"A few years ago, I wanted to dye my black hair a lighter color. However, I knew my Mom would NEVER go for it, and I didn't want to wait until I was 18 to do it. I did some research, and realized baking soda and hydrogen peroxide bleaches hair. I went to my Mom, pretended that I ""suddenly"" got the idea that putting baking soda in my hair would have health benefits, and convinced her to let me do it. I mixed everything together, (my Mom didn't know about the hydrogen peroxide), and bleached my hair. I KNEW that doing this went against my Mom's religious beliefs. Then, I convinced my Mom I was surprised about my hair's new color. My Mom told alot of people, including professional hairstylists who she's friends with. I have bleached my hair repeatedly since then, and now she thinks that my natural hair has turned brown."	1an9tr1	i manipulated and lied to my mom and a bunch of family	a few years ago i wanted to dye my black hair a lighter color however i knew my mom would never go for it and i didnt want to wait until i was  to do it i did some research and realized baking soda and hydrogen peroxide bleaches hair i went to my mom pretended that i suddenly got the idea that putting baking soda in my hair would have health benefits and convinced her to let me do it i mixed everything together my mom didnt know about the hydrogen peroxide and bleached my hair i knew that doing this went against my moms religious beliefs then i convinced my mom i was surprised about my hairs new color my mom told alot of people including professional hairstylists who shes friends with i have bleached my hair repeatedly since then and now she thinks that my natural hair has turned brown	antr

449	I have violated my roommates privacy because of my insane worries	"I have been diagnosed four years ago with OCD, in particular related to contamination (germs, bacteria, body fluids and pollutants). 

I am particularly sensible to cigarette smoke, it freaks me out and doesn’t allow me to get any close to cigarette smokers. 

My new roommate is a smoker, and his room is next to mine. I didn’t know him but his look was quite “bold”, he has piercings, tattoos, looks very tall and he gave ma an overall bad impression. 

Yesterday he wrote a message on our house chat group that he wouldn’t be home, and tonight I happened to not be able to sleep because of the terror that he might smoke in his room  through the window contaminating mine as well. 

I decided to walk in his room knowing he wouldn’t be there to check for any sign of him smoking inside his room, but I found him still sleeping. 

I pretended I suffer from sleepwalking and this allowed me to know him better. Turns out the dude is a super well educated guy who has a Chemical engineering degree, and offered himself to help me relax, drink some water and get fresh air. I apologised to him and gave him a lift to work as he doesn’t have a car or a bike. 

Now I feel terrible, cause I did something terrible to a genuinely nice guy and even pretended a “”illness”” (i know sleepwalking isn’t an illness) and I feel like an immature douchebag who deserves absolutely no love from anyone. 

I also feel disconnected to reality, almost like irrational took control over my rational life. I act non-sense, I’m controlled by my contamination obsession every day, for every single second of my life. I need to put my clothes out of the room just in case some contaminants went into them, I wash my hands multiple times per hour, and I need to make my girlfriend follow strict rules in order to prevent my anxiety.

450	Once while I was at work, I crashed the company van.	"I had a great job doing delivery driving for a bakery in town, and unfortunately I was also having trouble with my personal life. So one particularly stressful night, I was driving my usual route and the windshield was fogged and though the view was clearly not safe for driving, I was not thinking clearly and drove anyway. Then I heard this loud bang and it turned out I had crashed into a cement light post. I finished up and parked it so that you weren’t able to see the damage. 
It took two days before anyone was able to notice the damage and by that time I was able to say that I had noticed it too. (As if I wasn’t the cause) Nobody was punished and they continued like nothing happened."	1alqqv2	once while i was at work i crashed the company van	"i had a great job doing delivery driving for a bakery in town and unfortunately i was also having trouble with my personal life so one particularly stressful night i was driving my usual route and the windshield was fogged and though the view was clearly not safe for driving i was not thinking clearly and drove anyway then i heard this loud bang and it turned out i had crashed into a cement light post i finished up and parked it so that you werent able to see the damage

451	I started a non-profit for mental health but closed it because I was too mentally ill…	"Hi. Please delete this if this isn’t suppose to be here…

Back when covid wasn’t real, i started a non-profit for professional athletes to educate, provide information, and overall help their mental health well being. Of course, this was the time when the NFL “did not” believe there was any issue with concussions… ha.
 
My cousin was the co-founder and we had teams interested in us, had a board, but we couldn’t get enough funding to make it a functioning full time organization. After 2/3 years of trying and a hundreds of my own dollars given to the government, I decided to step down. It is one of the most shameful and upsetting events in my life as I feel like I’ve failed not only myself but other people. Right after I stepped down I ended up getting back into therapy, taking meds more seriously and being more proactive with using therapy techniques outside of my appointments. 

I still fucking hate that I have BPD. I hate mental illness. And I hate that I have to deal with it forever. Waking up is a struggle but you gotta do it.

452	I used to steal vending money to purchase vending items	"So I used to be in charge of all the vending machines at my old job. That included ordering the stuff, refilling the machine, and collecting the money from it. I never stole more than a few bucks at a time (every item was priced below a dollar) and I honestly don’t feel all that bad about it. 

Like, I feel bad because stealing is morally wrong, but they also underpaid me and treated me like crap most of the time so I feel like it was somewhat justified.

453	Ive been lying, stealing from family for years and I’m stuck	"Throwaway account for obvious reasons lol. I first started stealing my grandparents credit card for Nintendo games when I was young(couldn’t live with mother and father, grandparents had custody)I think over the time period of a year or 2 I had stolen about $500. I never had as much as other kids around me and I always felt below everyone so I wanted to have anything I could to “keep up.” I used to ask for money all the time(I could never learn how to make any,they kept me in the house religiously) I was a bad kid who was smart as hell but wouldn’t do work if I was paid too. I also had a large amount of mental problems that I had acquired from the traumatic past with my parents and I didn’t know how to handle it. I used to act out in class constantly. I had heavy ADHD they prescribed me stimulants that had me like a zombie. I hated them I never took them. They put me in a residential program instead of working with me themself. I always felt like my grandparents/parents didn’t really care about me at all and just wanted the problem(me)out their faces. Evidently at this point in time that wasn’t the case. 
 Skip ahead a few years I start smoking weed. At first it was just little carts with my friends in the neighborhood. At this point in time I wasn’t stealing anything(except some alcohol here and there), however the more I smoked the more I wanted it. I went into a haze. Next thing I know I sold my grandmas gold ring for some weed. After this happened, I got into a physical altercation with my grandfather and got put into a mental institution. And even though this was definitely an understandable choice in hindsight in the moment I was completely blindsided betrayed and hurt. I used to call them on the phone and they used to laugh at me and basically tell me thug it out. Some may call this tough love, but when I got discharged I definitely left with a chip on my shoulder. 
After that I was fine for a while of course, but you know that didn’t last forever. Next thing I know I stumble upon my grandfathers bedridden brothers bank account. Not gonna go into detail with what I did but I was able to take money out and withdraw it at the atms. I told myself at first I wasn’t gonna overdo it and at first I was able to do that, but then the money got to my head and I went fucking crazy. I stole upwards of $15,000 and spent it all on designer clothes, shoes, and Weed Weed Weed. 
For a while it was like that. Then the senior living company that was taking care of him checks bounced when they tried to take the money they worked for out. And they saw what I had done. Fortunately I was able to cover my tracks and I never got caught or charged or anything. But my family knew. 
After that I was broke as shit, 17, heavily addicted to weed. My best option at this point was probably to stop smoking, but you know I wasn’t gonna do that. I started stealing jewelry, probably more than $5k. They still don’t know about the extents that of that though. I just wanted to keep my high going. On the inside doing all this stealing was ripping my heart up I felt absolutely horrible. But for some reason my desire to escape overcame that. My grandfather also died around this time. It was very hard on me I was grieving for weeks. “How can I feel so bad for someone I hurt so much?” I asked myself. I knew him my whole life, he took me in out the kindness of his heart and I stabbed him in the back. I felt and still feel absolutely horrible. I started getting high more and more. I had dabbled with harder drugs but I knew in my heart that weed was what I wanted. So that’s what I got. I smoked about 2-5 backwoods a day for years. Shit I still smoke everyday. I plan to stop very soon however. 
Now you would think “Hey hopefully this kid learnt his lesson and he won’t try to do it again.” No no no no no. I started stealing out their other bank accounts, started finessing my grandmothers credit companies. Made her credit score go down 200 points. Took upwards of 4-6k in this phase. After all this, I’ve stopped stealing from them. As I said I plan to stop smoking very soon and find a job(although every fucking job I apply for doesn’t say shit back). I don’t want their forgiveness because I know I won’t get it. That fact tears me up inside but it’s something I had to accept. I’ve literally watched my grandmother go from loving and adoring me to resenting and being disgusted with me. And as I said, I know I’ll probably never have that back. I get my grandmother food and I help her out whenever I can. Even though it doesn’t mean shit at this point. But the thing is I can barely help her, I need to get my Self on track."	1alkiq5	ive been lying stealing from family for years and im stuck	"throwaway account for obvious reasons lol i first started stealing my grandparents credit card for nintendo games when i was youngcouldnt live with mother and father grandparents had custodyi think over the time period of a year or  i had stolen about  i never had as much as other kids around me and i always felt below everyone so i wanted to have anything i could to keep up i used to ask for money all the timei could never learn how to make anythey kept me in the house religiously i was a bad kid who was smart as hell but wouldnt do work if i was paid too i also had a large amount of mental problems that i had acquired from the traumatic past with my parents and i didnt know how to handle it i used to act out in class constantly i had heavy adhd they prescribed me stimulants that had me like a zombie i hated them i never took them they put me in a residential program instead of working with me themself i always felt like my grandparentsparents didnt really care about me at all and just wanted the problemmeout their faces evidently at this point in time that wasnt the case

454	I robbed my teacher in forth grade because she robbed me.	"Okay before I lead you too much falsely off my clickbait title. No I did not steal money from her or anything of too much significant value. And when I took was rightfully mine. Now for the rest of the story.

When I was in 4th grade I met my teacher will call her Mrs Puff. Mrs Puff was an odd lady and she had this sort of reward system where if you were behaving or if you did your work well or if you did one of her other good behavior activities or we're good in general she would give you these things called banana bucks. And they had a picture of a monkey on them and they were made of paper and they were actually a pretty cool idea. Well the only thing with these banana bucks besides earning them through good behavior and good work was that you could only spend them twice a year which was a Christmas time and at the end of the year on her prize shop. She kept the shop on full display for us throughout the year to keep us encouraged to behave and I was already a very well behaved kid because of good parents at the time. And I was a very good student as well. And so these banana bucks ranged in denomination from 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and $200 as you can imagine she did not hand out very many 100s but she handed them out to me because I was a very quiet kid probably at least once or twice a day I got banana bucks and I stuck them in my desk in a little baggie. Well eventually winter time came and she wanted us to spend them however I was trying to save them because there was a big prize that I wanted and while I probably could have afforded it then I wanted to get it at the end of the year as a treat for myself. By the way the price costed $500,000 bucks. The next highest prize was only $20,000 bucks. Anyway so when Christmas rolled around I probably only spent $3,000 bucks on a little bit of candy and a little bit of small toys like a couple Hot Wheels or something. And so I continued to save and at some point throughout the spring semester my bag became full so I shoved it to the back of my desk and started a new bag and when the end of the year came there were two prize days for the two last days of class and I couldn't find all of my money on the first day so I didn't spend it and on the second day however I did find my first bag and I counted it all up three times I had a million and a half banana bucks. And I was ecstatic because not only could I buy the thing I really wanted which I believe was an RC boat or car but I could buy anything else I wanted in the shop probably the whole shop however once she realized what had happened she quickly gathered up my money told me that I could pick out three things from the shop but not the big prize and that that was my reward so I begrudgingly took three higher-end prizes but I was pissed off. So later that night I was stewing in my anger and I knew that I had to get back at her somehow but I didn't know how hey I didn't want to make it too obvious by doing something like stealing her purse first off cuz I would actually hurt her and second off because that would probably lead her straight to me. On the plus side though she had really screwed herself over because she graded very harshly on kids for dumb things for instance she took 20% off a 95% test that I had simply because I forgot to write my name or the date I can't remember I can understand a couple points or 5%, but 20% hell no. So my mom quickly fixed that issue after a few instances along with a bunch of other parents who are having similar problems where the kids would be right but they wouldn't be right in her way. I was also fortunate in that in the school I went to they were about 30 teachers kids and seven of them happened to be in my grade and a few more were in that part of the elementary and so while our moms were clearing out their stuff for the summer Mrs Puff was packing up her things not only to go in a storage but also to leave the school because she had not gotten her contract renewed. So during one of the meetings that she had I recruited a couple of the kids to help me take all of the stuff from her prize store and hide it in different places throughout the school. We were placed the empty boxes with some other stuff that weighed roughly the same amount of various school supplies and as far as I know she never reached back out to the school saying that her prize supply was stolen and over the next few days because it's a week process to clear out the school I brought a duffel bag with some toys in it and made sure to bring home a candy and toys that I had rightfully gotten back as well as giving a cut to the kids who helped me out."	1alcrnq	i robbed my teacher in forth grade because she robbed me	"okay before i lead you too much falsely off my clickbait title no i did not steal money from her or anything of too much significant value and when i took was rightfully mine now for the rest of the story

when i was in th grade i met my teacher will call her mrs puff mrs puff was an odd lady and she had this sort of reward system where if you were behaving or if you did your work well or if you did one of her other good behavior activities or were good in general she would give you these things called banana bucks and they had a picture of a monkey on them and they were made of paper and they were actually a pretty cool idea well the only thing with these banana bucks besides earning them through good behavior and good work was that you could only spend them twice a year which was a christmas time and at the end of the year on her prize shop she kept the shop on full display for us throughout the year to keep us encouraged to behave and i was already a very well behaved kid because of good parents at the time and i was a very good student as well and so these banana bucks ranged in denomination from      and  as you can imagine she did not hand out very many s but she handed them out to me because i was a very quiet kid probably at least once or twice a day i got banana bucks and i stuck them in my desk in a little baggie well eventually winter time came and she wanted us to spend them however i was trying to save them because there was a big prize that i wanted and while i probably could have afforded it then i wanted to get it at the end of the year as a treat for myself by the way the price costed  bucks the next highest prize was only  bucks anyway so when christmas rolled around i probably only spent  bucks on a little bit of candy and a little bit of small toys like a couple hot wheels or something and so i continued to save and at some point throughout the spring semester my bag became full so i shoved it to the back of my desk and started a new bag and when the end of the year came there were two prize days for the two last days of class and i couldnt find all of my money on the first day so i didnt spend it and on the second day however i did find my first bag and i counted it all up three times i had a million and a half banana bucks and i was ecstatic because not only could i buy the thing i really wanted which i believe was an rc boat or car but i could buy anything else i wanted in the shop probably the whole shop however once she realized what had happened she quickly gathered up my money told me that i could pick out three things from the shop but not the big prize and that that was my reward so i begrudgingly took three higherend prizes but i was pissed off so later that night i was stewing in my anger and i knew that i had to get back at her somehow but i didnt know how hey i didnt want to make it too obvious by doing something like stealing her purse first off cuz i would actually hurt her and second off because that would probably lead her straight to me on the plus side though she had really screwed herself over because she graded very harshly on kids for dumb things for instance she took  off a  test that i had simply because i forgot to write my name or the date i cant remember i can understand a couple points or  but  hell no so my mom quickly fixed that issue after a few instances along with a bunch of other parents who are having similar problems where the kids would be right but they wouldnt be right in her way i was also fortunate in that in the school i went to they were about  teachers kids and seven of them happened to be in my grade and a few more were in that part of the elementary and so while our moms were clearing out their stuff for the summer mrs puff was packing up her things not only to go in a storage but also to leave the school because she had not gotten her contract renewed so during one of the meetings that she had i recruited a couple of the kids to help me take all of the stuff from her prize store and hide it in different places throughout the school we were placed the empty boxes with some other stuff that weighed roughly the same amount of various school supplies and as far as i know she never reached back out to the school saying that her prize supply was stolen and over the next few days because its a week process to clear out the school i brought a duffel bag with some toys in it and made sure to bring home a candy and toys that i had rightfully gotten back as well as giving a cut to the kids who helped me out"	alcrnq
455	I’ve been lying about getting assignments done at work and I’m about to get fired. Again.	"2/6/24
I deserve what’s coming, but wanted to get some things off my chest. This is looooong because I’ve never been honest about everything before.

I was a smart kid growing up, and lots of adults thought I had a lot of potential. Even in 5th grade and onwards when I started to struggle with getting homework done, everyone viewed me as smart. I would lie consistently about why I hadn’t turned in certain assignments, or why my teachers didn’t receive them. I went through high school without failing any classes thankfully, but knew I could have done better.

Fast forward to college, and things started off well! Great grades for the first semester. Then, as things went on, things got worse. Grades plummeted. I stopped going to class because I was afraid of how people would view me. Lied to everyone about how I was doing. I flunked out.

Fast forward to my first professional job outside of my failed attempt at college! It was at a major organization that I had previously interned with, and I lied about having graduated. Things started off well, but then when it came time to do certain self-paced tasks…I just didn’t do them. I kept on telling myself “oh, I can do I later.” Only “later” never came. I eventually got diagnosed with ADHD, but it was too late. My bosses found out I didn’t do a major, super important task that I’m supposed to do. I tried lying and making excuses, but I got fired. 

Fast forward to more recent times! I finished my bachelor’s online, which was awesome! Got a new job! And even started a masters program! New job and masters program started off great…but you guessed it. Over time in my program, I stopped doing my assignments as I was having such trouble motivating myself to get started. And since I work from home, I kept on telling myself I could do things later and would distract myself by playing video games or literally just staring at my phone, endlessly scrolling. Now, I have three incompletes from last semester that I need to finish within two weeks, or I fail those classes. I haven’t even started on those assignments. But the worst part, and what brings me to post, is the situation at work now…

Once again, I didn’t do a super important task I’m expected to do. Once again, I got caught. And once again, I lied and said I had done it and that there must have been a computer error. Basically I was supposed to monitor sales calls, take notes, and submit monitoring forms. While I did do some monitoring, I didn’t do any of the forms and didn’t take extensive notes. The higher ups don’t believe me, my boss is gutted because she’s advocated for me in the past, but I think they’re still trying to give me some benefit of the doubt. Now, they want copies of all my notes, which I obviously don’t have. This gives me two options: lie again, and make up some notes and pretend I did everything I was supposed to. Or come clean about lying.

I know option 2 is the right answer. But when I got fired the first time, my bf was so disappointed. He wants to be with someone capable and driven. I’m not being pessimistic when I say if I lost my job, again, he would break up with me. I would have to tell everyone what a failure I am. I might even have to drop out of my masters program, because I’m barely making ends meet as it is. All these pressures drove me to seriously consider suicide yesterday. Thankfully I’m a bit calmer now, and I know I would never want to do that no matter how bad things get.

I’m so scared, so ashamed, and so disgusted with myself. I’ve been telling everyone that I’m okay, and just lying. My parents will be so disappointed. Sorry, I know this was long.

UPDATE: also, am I supposed to edit my post to provide an update? I’m not on Reddit much so I don’t know!)

Thank you for all of your comments, seriously. I really appreciated the wide variety of responses. When I wrote this post, I was leaning towards making up the notes. But upon reading your comments, I reflected and realized that if anything were to change, I needed to be honest (with myself and others) and face the consequences, whatever they may be.

I wrote a long email to my boss outlining all that I’ve been struggling with and told them that I hadn’t done the monitoring and trapped myself in a lie. I told them that I would do whatever it takes to rebuild trust, but that I understand if I needed to be terminated. I expressed my gratitude for their support, and apologized for failing when they have advocated for me so much.

Once I sent the email, it was a weird mixture of emotions. I was obviously super nervous, not sure what would happen. But it was also freeing. It felt good to just send the email and get it out there that I’m not okay.

Didn’t hear from my boss for a full day until I got invited to a call with them and HR. I was expecting the worst, but I’m so happy to say that I was not terminated. I’m going on a PIP, which is honestly exactly what I could use. I’m so, so grateful. One thing that helped was that I’ve succeed in many other aspects of my job. Even if I had been terminated though, I know I would have done the right thing by coming clean. It was the only way to potentially break the pattern.

In terms of the recommendations, I am on medication but had only just started seeing a therapist (we only had one session prior to my post). I don’t take medication all the time because of how it affects my appetite, but im definitely more productive when taking it. I think a lot of you are spot on though in that this is more than just ADHD, and my therapist has since recommended antidepressants. Since I came clean, I’ve been on a roll with productivity. I even worked out! But of course, the real challenge is keeping it up. I’m also going to drop out of one of my classes for my masters program. This will delay my graduation for a full year because of prerequisite stuff. I’m going to talk to my parents tonight and be honest with them about how I’m feeling. I already told them that I wasn’t feeling great, and they’re worried about me.

The hardest step coming up is actually finishing my incompletes as well as telling my bf that I’m delaying graduating by a year. I think that will be a real test to see if I’m actually on the right track, or just getting a temporary boost from being honest and not being terminated. I started the app Habatica and it’s been helpful for the past couple of days. I’ll try to update again at the end of the month to let yall know how that went.

I know other people said that they’re also in similar situations, lying to themselves and others. I highly, highly recommend coming clean. I don’t know if this will lead to lasting change, but at least right now I can say that I hope and believe it will. And now, there are people who know what I’m struggling with and are even willing to provide support. I was incredibly lucky in how my company reacted, but even if I had been fired, the only way I think I would actually change is by starting to be authentic and honest, with myself and others, regardless of the consequences.

456	I lied to everyone in 4 years about my academic and social life.	I'm a 8th. Semester student of an uni in Europe but I only finished the courses of the 1st. Semester. But I lied to everyone that I'm about to finish and that I could finish earlier if it wasn't for COVID. It's yes and no because of COVID. It's no because it was me who was lazy and didn't do all the work. It's also because of COVID that I didn't make any friends at the uni since we all studied only and didn't even see each other faces. 2 years of online and when the 3rd year came, somehow everyone seemed to know each other already. I was all frustrated and didn't pay attention to the courses and leading them to failure. Now I really wanted to graduate but it was overwhelming with all the courses and the lies I made.

Kinda funny, kinda not. I feel bad to an extend because everyone who knows me thinks I don’t like ketchup but the reality of it is I did and probably still do.  I haven’t eaten ketchup since that day and for the sake of 8 year old me I will continue to refuse to eat ketchup because I gotta admire the dedication.	1ak086r	ive gaslit myself and everyone around me for the last  years	when i was  my grandma took my cousins sisters and everyone out to wendys for lunch i ordered my burger with no tomatoes because i dont and didnt like tomatoes and then i went to get ketchup for my fries and my grandma said you know ketchup has tomatoes in it correct from that day forward i have everyone convinced i dont like ketchup and i even had myself convinced up until the other day when the memory played through my head again and i realized i was just gaslighting everyone kinda funny kinda not i feel bad to an extend because everyone who knows me thinks i dont like ketchup but the reality of it is i did and probably still do  i havent eaten ketchup since that day and for the sake of  year old me i will continue to refuse to eat ketchup because i gotta admire the dedication	akr

460	I stole clothes and shoes when I was a child, and I was so good at it that it took about 3 years to get caught	"My family was secretly well off because my parents were dealers. My needs were usually met, but when my sister was born, they started neglecting us both (and hid it well). From early infancy on I would put my sister in my bed at night with me because I didn’t trust all their friends and “customers” being around her at odd hours of the night. I now feel bad about that because I know co-sleeping can be dangerous, but I didn’t know it back then. I made her bottles, brushed her hair, and changed her diapers a lot even though I was only 8 when she was born.

Since my parents didn’t keep my old clothes and they didn’t pay enough attention to get her new clothes when she needed them, I would go into stores and steal clothes and shoes. Ironically when my parents caught on I’d get disciplined, and yet this cycle continued until we were placed with my Grandmother when I was 11 or 12. Probably 95% of her clothes were stolen by me. I also stole clothes for myself and eventually got caught a whole 3 years after I started. 

I look back on how many times I stole and am kind of impressed at how good I got, though I’m not proud of it. I know that sounds contradictory."	1aj5ya5	i stole clothes and shoes when i was a child and i was so good at it that it took about  years to get caught	"my family was secretly well off because my parents were dealers my needs were usually met but when my sister was born they started neglecting us both and hid it well from early infancy on i would put my sister in my bed at night with me because i didnt trust all their friends and customers being around her at odd hours of the night i now feel bad about that because i know cosleeping can be dangerous but i didnt know it back then i made her bottles brushed her hair and changed her diapers a lot even though i was only  when she was born

463	I once licked the urine of a man without him knowing.	"It’s not my freaking kink, I swear. I know I was being a pervert in this whole story, but here we go. During my sophomore year (around 2021), I (20M) had a crush one of my friend of friend (21M). He was a very charming guy, and he’s definitely not gay. I somehow befriended him. By “Befriending”, I mean, being friends as man to man. He didn’t even have a slight idea that I was gay at the time. Although I am gay, but I showed no sign of femininity. He was kinda gay phobic. I used to go to his room and he use to go around naked in his room. I swear to god, I couldn’t take my eyes off his thingy, but I kept on complimenting it to him like “Nice cock, bro”. He usually laughed and shrugged it off. I had no balls to tell him I loved him, cuz you know, he was kinda gay phobic.

One day, during junior college, we were on a planned picnic with other friends on a small mountain not far from town, we had some drinking, but I wasn’t a big drinker. He was kinda intoxicated and I was sober. As I saw him leaving for peeing behind the bush, I put my hand on his shoulder and we went to pee. Yes, seeing his ding dong turned me on and I faked texting with my friend and asked him to go back before me. After he left the bush, The God of Horniness struck me with his power and I licked his urine which splattered on the leaves. It is disgusting, I know what you think. I had never done that before, it wasn’t and isn’t my kink and I don’t know what got into me. My soul left my body when I heard a call near from my back “what are you doing?”. I was stunned. I somehow found a good answer, “I just feel like vomiting, I am not a good drinker.”. The guy (friend of the guy I had a crush on) laughed and said “Yeah, I understand.” and he peed. 

We are now graduated and he’s now back to his hometown miles away from mine. I still regret what I did that day. I was and still is so ashamed of myself. 

Is it wrong to do this?

464	I stole an air purifier from Wally World because I couldn’t afford it…..	"I stole an air purifier from Walmart. Even the small ones for a bedroom are really expensive. My dog was born with heart problems and he just turned 9. He’s been on medicine for over almost 2 years now and they’ve upped his medicine twice in a year. His cough recently has gotten really bad. I have an appointment for the vet in like 2 weeks. I looked up some ways to help his cough (besides all the medicine he’s already on) and to rid the lungs of fluid is to improve the over all air quality. So I already have a small humidifier to help loosen the mucus but I needed an air purifier. I just wanted a small one for my bedroom to see if it helps but the smallest one I could find at Wally World was like $70. I’ve been feeling really guilty but his cough has just been getting worse and I can’t move up the appointment but I couldn’t afford the purifier and I’m really hoping it helps.


Update 2/7: thank you everyone so much for the love and support ❤️❤️ I truly appreciate it. My fur baby is doing a little better and it has been helping not just him but me as well. I also moved up his vet appointment as much as I could so I wouldn’t have to wait any longer."	1ahnez5	i stole an air purifier from wally world because i couldnt afford it	"i stole an air purifier from walmart even the small ones for a bedroom are really expensive my dog was born with heart problems and he just turned  hes been on medicine for over almost  years now and theyve upped his medicine twice in a year his cough recently has gotten really bad i have an appointment for the vet in like  weeks i looked up some ways to help his cough besides all the medicine hes already on and to rid the lungs of fluid is to improve the over all air quality so i already have a small humidifier to help loosen the mucus but i needed an air purifier i just wanted a small one for my bedroom to see if it helps but the smallest one i could find at wally world was like  ive been feeling really guilty but his cough has just been getting worse and i cant move up the appointment but i couldnt afford the purifier and im really hoping it helps

466	I’m failing college and and wasting money and I don’t know how to get out	"Hey everyone,
This is my first Reddit post ever but I just need to get something off of my chest. 
I graduated from high school in 2020 and attended a college that I was not super excited to go to in the middle of COVID. Needless to say, the pairing of already not being super stoked to be a student at this college along with being in a weird mental state because of the state of the world at the time made motivation extremely hard to come by. In my first year I was academically disqualified from that school. I was put on a program called open university, which would have given me the opportunity to continue attending school there if I had gone through with it. However, I did little to no research on what that actually meant, and just took it as I was kicked out of the school. 
I kept this information from my parents and my friends and just told them that I was not going to be attending that school anymore because I was not able to find housing for the following year. 
So the next year I started attending a local community college. And again, needless to say, the combination of attending a school that I was even less stoked to be going to paired with being in the worst year for my mental state in my life made finding motivation hard. I barely signed up for any classes because I did not put any research into what I needed to take, and even then I ended up failing most of them. 
However, I couldn’t let my friends know that I felt like a complete failure, and that summer (summer 2021), I lied to all of my friends and told them that I was going to be transferring to a state university with a good reputation in the fall, and that I would be living with one of my old friends who attended the school. And come Fall ‘21 (when I obviously would not be attending the school with said reputation) I just told my friends that the housing situation with my old friend didn’t work out and I would have to be commuting to school (another lie). 
Similar story for the ‘21-‘22 school year, no research, terrible mental state, only a few classes, and still failed most of them. All while telling my friends that I had good grades and was doing great in life because my ego would not let me admit that I was a fraud and a failure. And since I was still not attending this state school I told everyone that I was at, I had to come up with another lie as to why I was still at home. All I could come up with was that I was going to be living with another friend, which did not work out come Fall ‘23 either (creative, I know). 
Come the ‘22-‘23 school year, same situation; no research, terrible mental state, only a few classes, still failed most of them. However, I also began to date this girl that I knew from high school. This girl was a friend of mine that I kept in contact with since we graduated high school, so she was aware of the, we’ll call it“unlucky situations that I was in regarding college housing”. I knew that in order to have a healthy relationship I would need to confess all of my lies about my situation to her; come clean about my lies and tell her that I was a fraud. However, I was scared that she would view me as a failure, and, being my first real relationship, that scared me. So I did not tell her, and instead doubled down the lie like I did to all of my close friends and people that care about me. Come summer ‘23, I needed yet another lie to explain why I was not going to be attending this state school that I told all of my friends that I was in, so I told everyone that I was taking a gap year to pursue and internship that is associated with my major and desired career path. I knew that this was wrong, but for some reason qualified the lie by telling myself that I would get into the state school that I already told my friends I was attending come fall ‘24, so everything would work out okay. 
Well here I am, heading into spring ‘24, college apps sent in a couple of months ago (fall ‘23) with a 1.21 cumulative gpa, no chance of getting into any of the 6 schools that I applied to come fall ‘24, and still laying on a bed of lies that my friends and girlfriend believe, because why wouldn’t they? On top of this, I had been lying to my parents, saying that my grades were good these past couple of years. How could I tell them that I was basically flushing their money down the drain these past couple of years? I have no chance of transferring to a school next year. I will be on my fourth year of a two year college. 

I really do not know what to do. I’ve thought about coming clean to my friends and girlfriend. I just can’t bring myself to do it. These people mean a lot to me and I feel like coming clean to everyone would only end with me being alone. That everyone would leave me. And why wouldn’t they? They would have no reason to trust me. I have been lying to them for over 3 years now. I’m too scared to tell them what a failure I truly am. Especially my girlfriend who I really love. I’ve thought about coming clean to my parents about the fact that I have been wasting their hard earned money. I do not know what to do. I know the answer is obvious and I just need to shape up and figure my shit out, and I have started taking those steps into being the person that I have lied about being all of these years. But I don’t know how approach this to my friends or family. Do I quadruple down on the lie? I seriously cannot imagine a situation where I come completely clean about this and still keep my friends and relationship in tact. 

If anyone has any advice, either on this situation or on help with the school transfer process that would be more than greatly appreciated. 

TL/DR: I’m failing community college and have been lying to everyone in my life about attending a state school and need help trying to find a resolution."	1ah8sww	im failing college and and wasting money and i dont know how to get out	"hey everyone

467	I got high and did it again. I confess to putting money down and just straight up taking the weight	"this morning I got spun, but it wasn't enough. so I grabbed 60bux and took some out n out money in. I know someone saw me do it. it was a very dear friend of mine, used to be at least, either them or I have been abused by this dope just as much we abuse it. rightfully so I am scared cuz I know, we ALL know, that guy is gonna come around searching for it. rest assured I cant lie outta this one. idk what to expect honestly. I pray for it to be some thing in regards to a monetary penance, although im already on one, i think. 
weird strange situations aside, I am entirely at fault for this regretful tweaker attitude. yes, I'm a junkie. yes I don't like it. but I just didn't think beyond my action when I went to that sack.

so to you, guy with the mission: I'm very FUCKING sorry. I know just recently ive been misled about recurring themes like this one. idk what id have to accomplish to make it right/satisfactory. any one else whom I've made uncomfortable regarding such activity is also welcome to gripe to their merry pleasure.

468	I held a child's hand in a way that was intentionally painful because I was frustrated	"Many years ago I was working a job as an assistant at a private school. There was a little boy there with major behavior problems: kicking, cussing, being destructive, etc. I was at my wits end trying to keep the other kids safe and the classroom peaceful. When he got out of control I used to hold his hand, but he'd yank and fight it like crazy. Eventually, I used a trick my dad had taught me and held his hand by the fleshy part just above the wrist bone. Because it was painful for him when I held him tighter, he stopped pulling. Additionally, I held him by the ear to accomplish the same thing and put my hand on his cheeks to get him to look at me when I was talking. There were two other children I was rough with, too. I also put my hand on their faces to make them look at me when I was talking.

I hate myself for what I did. It was so, so wrong. He needed help. They all needed a grown-up that was in control. I grew up in a family where being rough was the norm. I thought it was normal at the time, the way I treated him. After all, I would see kids pulled by the ear all the time in cartoons. God I'm stupid. I still work with kids, and I'm often praised for how patient I am. I feel like I'm the only one who knows I'm a monster. Part of me feels like I should quit and find another profession, that I don't belong anywhere near children. This is my deepest, darkest secret and I'm incredibly ashamed. I try to tell myself that it wasn't abusive because I didn't leave marks, but I know that's bullshit.

Edit for some context: No, I'm not rough with kids anymore. The little boy went to an administrator to share what I was doing. I got a talking to from the principal, and I never did it again. If I have one strength it's never needing to be told the same thing twice. 

It seems like I intensified fear in people about leaving their children in childcare. I can say with certainty that I am an aberration. If I was saved by one thing, it's the many talented and compassionate people I've been fortunate enough to work with. I'm sorry to create distrust, that wasn't my intention. You have tools, and open communication is the sharpest. One of the best things about my story is that it was a very brief time between when I started behaving roughly and when I was caught. 

It seems there's a solid minority of you who don't believe people can change. Right now I don't know whether I agree or disagree. Part of me feels tainted. That's the part that wants to quit and never look back. The other parts of me, though, they have a lot to give.

472	In 2nd grade I caused my school to be fined 600 dollars	"I was a introvert, quiet, known to be well behaved type of kid. I was in the after school program and one day when I was wandering about on my own I came across this small red box on a wall that said «PRESS HERE🔥». I already knew I wasn’t allowed to touch it because we’d all been given stern instructions earlier that month NOT to touch it. But somehow I still managed to convince myself that CLEARLY I’M SUPPOSED TO PRESS IT, BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT IT SAYS.

I think you know where this is going. Alarm went off. Chaos erupted. I realised my mistake. Teachers were running and children were crying. I quickly stepped away from the wall and put on a fake confused face. The fire brigade showed up. A teacher even stopped to ask me if I saw who did it, never thinking it could have been the innocent, good kid. 

Another kid got in trouble for doing it, and the school tried to charge his parents the 600$ fine of the fire trucks beeing called out on a false alarm. In the end they had to drop the fine because the other kid kept denying he did it. 

Because of the possibility of my parents getting fined and me getting in trouble I never told anyone. I’m 32 now and still scared to tell them, lol!"	1afyy91	in nd grade i caused my school to be fined  dollars	"i was a introvert quiet known to be well behaved type of kid i was in the after school program and one day when i was wandering about on my own i came across this small red box on a wall that said press here i already knew i wasnt allowed to touch it because wed all been given stern instructions earlier that month not to touch it but somehow i still managed to convince myself that clearly im supposed to press it because thats what it says

474	I used red nail polish to paint a clown face on a guy in the army.	"I used to live on an Army base about 30 years ago. My best friend, her husband  and I had went out and they invited some people back to her house after the bars closed. One guy, in the army, was very inebriated. He said something so rude to my best friend that it made me so mad. He later passed out on her couch. I went in the bathroom and found a bottle of red nail polish and proceeded to paint his eyebrows red, his nose, and around his mouth.  We then set an alarm to go off 5 minutes later. We convinced him it was 5am, almost time for work. (It was actually 2am). He got up and left, and by sheer, dumb luck, he didn't have a rear view mirror. It turned out that he went to the barracks and passed out, then when he actually had to get up,  he simply threw on his uniform, then went to stand at attention with his platoon for an inspection. He didn't understand why people were calling him Bozo, until the Platoon sergeant berated him in front of his entire platoon for having a clown face. He was then told to get that sh#t off his face. He had to go buy nail polish remover, but unfortunately for him, he couldn't get the nail polish off of his eyebrows. He ended up having to shave them off. My friend's husband was in the guy's platoon and saw all of this happening. He came back and told us all about it. The next time we went out, he saw us and came up to us, being very nice. He even offered to buy us each a drink. We politely refused. We started calling him ""Halfbrow"" after that. We always watched our backs around Halfbrow.  I do feel bad about the fact that we had him drive back to the barracks inebriated. We didn't really think that part through.

475	I chewed up every square millimeter of an entire pencil to shreds in 5th grade then stuck it back in the pencil jar for the class	"We had this jar in 5th grade full of pencils that anyone could use when they needed a pencil and I took one and chewed every bit of the pencil to the point that it looked like Freddy Krueger but as a pencil. Actually worse. It was just mangled shreds, you could not even make it out as a pencil. It shouldn't have legally counted as a pencil. It looked like it had been through every world war. It was gruesome to look at. I then stuck it back in the jar of pencils, ready for some children to use the mangled pencil. But the teacher found it before any of the kids did, and she lined us all up and tried to force a confession out of whoever the horrible monster that mutilated the pencil was. She was infuriated. Especially that this incident should occur at our big age. I did not confess I stood my ground. To this day no one but 2 people in that class knows im the one who stuck the terrifyingly mutilated ""pencil"" back in the jar for everyone to enjoy."	1afcg9j	i chewed up every square millimeter of an entire pencil to shreds in th grade then stuck it back in the pencil jar for the class	we had this jar in th grade full of pencils that anyone could use when they needed a pencil and i took one and chewed every bit of the pencil to the point that it looked like freddy krueger but as a pencil actually worse it was just mangled shreds you could not even make it out as a pencil it shouldnt have legally counted as a pencil it looked like it had been through every world war it was gruesome to look at i then stuck it back in the jar of pencils ready for some children to use the mangled pencil but the teacher found it before any of the kids did and she lined us all up and tried to force a confession out of whoever the horrible monster that mutilated the pencil was she was infuriated especially that this incident should occur at our big age i did not confess i stood my ground to this day no one but  people in that class knows im the one who stuck the terrifyingly mutilated pencil back in the jar for everyone to enjoy	afcgj
476	I stole hundreds of dollars from my job and never got caught	So I was young and dumb and going through a rough time financially. I had a job as a manager at a college campus restaurant. Most of the workers were students, including foreign exchange students that were sometimes unfamiliar with the American currency--meaning there were often a lot of errors, especially at times when a new round of students would come in from semester to semester. Every night the manager (me) took out the drawers and went to the office to count it.

477	I stole hundreds of dollars from my junior high and never got caught	I used to volunteer at the cafeteria at my junior high at lunch time and I was often the person handling the cash. There was always a teacher doing it with us, but every time she’d look away I would take a $20 bill and put it in my pocket. The first time I did it I only took maybe $40 but eventually it got to the point where I was taking at least $100 a day. The money never went to anything useful, but it was more the thrill of not being caught. I never told anyone about this and I’m embarrassed about it. I don’t understand how they didn’t catch me considering they bought lunches from places like edo and subway and I’m sure they would’ve noticed they weren’t making that money back but somehow I never got caught.	1af6syx	i stole hundreds of dollars from my junior high and never got caught	i used to volunteer at the cafeteria at my junior high at lunch time and i was often the person handling the cash there was always a teacher doing it with us but every time shed look away i would take a  bill and put it in my pocket the first time i did it i only took maybe  but eventually it got to the point where i was taking at least  a day the money never went to anything useful but it was more the thrill of not being caught i never told anyone about this and im embarrassed about it i dont understand how they didnt catch me considering they bought lunches from places like edo and subway and im sure they wouldve noticed they werent making that money back but somehow i never got caught	afsyx
478	I stole a backpack from an elementary school that my sis went to	My sister would get food delivered to us in a back pack for not well off families. It would contain dried goods as well as a couple canned goods as that is what the child could carry. All three of us kids loved when they sent chocolate milk cartons; they were the best treat we had.  My fault in this was when the school year was over and we got our last bag of goods I kept the back pack. Mom and dad wouldn’t have been able to buy me a backpack for school the whole 4 years I was at high school. The next year my sister in elementary got the food in a back pack they had numbered the backpack very clearly in sharpie. I feel so guilty. I used that backpack all four years of high school and I stole it.	1af6oc5	i stole a backpack from an elementary school that my sis went to	my sister would get food delivered to us in a back pack for not well off families it would contain dried goods as well as a couple canned goods as that is what the child could carry all three of us kids loved when they sent chocolate milk cartons they were the best treat we had  my fault in this was when the school year was over and we got our last bag of goods i kept the back pack mom and dad wouldnt have been able to buy me a backpack for school the whole  years i was at high school the next year my sister in elementary got the food in a back pack they had numbered the backpack very clearly in sharpie i feel so guilty i used that backpack all four years of high school and i stole it	afoc
479	I used to steal money from rude customers at my job, and I never got caught.	"I'm long gone from this job so I can finally get this off of my chest. 

I (25F), used to work at a very large corporate convenient store/gas station. I was working there around the age of 16 to 17. I hated working there so badly. I loved to work, but that job was so stressful, it got tiring. The only thing that was worth it, was the fact that I was getting paid weekly, instead of biweekly. The checks were what was keeping me around.

The managers were creeps, and definitely held favoritism with their own, mostly when it came to race, and family as well. I got hired because they needed serious help, I was looking for a job in the area by any means and decided to give it a shot. The job had a detailed description as to what I'd specifically be doing, and after months of doing that, maybe about three, they eventually had me running the whole store, which believe it or not can get pretty hectic when it's just one person there, or another person slacking off. It wasn't apart of the job description deal, but I had decided to put up with it anyway. 

The main problem was that the customers were horrible, everyone had attitudes, would take their anger out on me, or even tried to fight me behind the counter. I'm not the type of person to back down, so unfortunately I would entertain the negative energy and even try to fight back. I was young, immature, and wasn't the type to ignore, or allow disrespect. 

Eventually, due time, it did get to the point where I had decided the money wasn't enough to stay, but instead of leaving, I got the idea to steal. So I had came up with this plan. Being that I had access to the whole store, I was mainly in charge of being on the register. So I had access to checking out the customers who wanted to purchase items. What I did was only possible with cash, so unfortunately if a rude customer was paying card, I had no choice but to let them get away with it. Now if a rude customer was paying cash, I would give them their change back, just short. The way our register was organized, it had it so that there was an extra slot that was kept empty. I would give the customer back their change a dollar or even two short, and put that in the empty slot. Then at the end of the shift, when it was time for me to count the money for store totals, i would keep the money I took from the customers, and make sure everything added up and that there wasn't too little or too much so that counts would match up.

It might not seem like much, but one to two dollars can add up due time. I would work ten hour shifts, and get so many rude customers. By the end of my shift I had as much money as an average waitress could make through tips. At least fifty dollars a day. I worked almost every day of the week too, including weekends, so you can do the math.

Long story short, I was making extra money on top of the weekly checks I was already getting, but unfortunately, it was out of an inconvenience of a rude customer, and something completely illegal. 

Don't be rude to retail workers, and definitely count to make sure you have all your change.

480	I hesitated to take my dog to the vet, then she died of a fungal infection that invaded her brain.	"My dog, Rizzo, had turned two in October.  A few weeks ago, she had some reverse sneezing fits that were alarming, but they didn't happen often and then they stopped.  The week before things got really bad, she had a runny nose.  It started off clear, and then turned a bit more thick/mucousy.  Otherwise, she was herself.  High appetite, long walks, playing tug of war just a day before she bottomed out.  

I remember starting to get concerned about the runny nose.  It was most apparent in the evenings when she would sit beside me on a chair in the office.  A string of goo would come out, and I would need to wipe her nose.  But I didn't take her to the vet.

I thought it would pass.  I was distracted trying to get my car back from the shop, waiting to hear on a new job offer, hiking to the pharmacy to get my own UTI meds in the middle of an ice storm, and preparing to move across town on a deadline.  

But last Friday night, she bottomed out.  I had her at a boarding facility for the night because movers were supposed to have shown up early the next day and I wanted her to play and have fun over there rather than be stressed with strangers in and out of the house.  I figured it was safe to let her go to boarding because she had no other symptoms: no coughing, no eye discharge, no loss of appetite/energy or anything that would indicate anything serious or contagious.

10pm that night, the manager called me and asked me to pick Rizzo up and take her to an emergency vet.  She suddenly couldn't walk very well.  Her eyes were drooping and blood shot, and she looked disoriented.  The vet did chest/neck/head x-rays, all of which came back clear.  Her blood work came back normal.  They felt a swollen lymph node under her chin, and when they tested the fluid, they found fungal cells that they didn't immediately recognize.  They sent those off to testing and sent me home with two different antibiotics, an antifungal, and a pain medication for her.  

Four days later, we got results confirming that she had cryptococcosis, a rare fungal infection that in dogs that often begins in the nose and progresses rapidly toward the central nervous system.  We started intense, IV antifungal treatment and IV fluids, but she only made it to Saturday morning.  

I keep picturing those moments when I wiped her nose and thought ""this is weird, but I can't take her to the vet right now - after the move - maybe it will go away on its own.""  

There was one night I did hear her sniffling out on the couch and brought her into the bed with me.  

So, it was probably a week and a half or so of noticeable symptoms before she completely bottomed out.  I just kept waiting for some reason.  

I let her slide down my priorities list in the exact time she needed me to prioritize her.

I swear I was like the imposter on among us where I just drive away quickly onto the Main Street so it’s impossible I was “there” when it happened. I know it sounds horrible but if nobody was there then nobody knows what happened and I’m the only one who knows so bam.	1aeju7x	i bumped into a parked car trying to do a  point turn on a narrow street under construction about a month ago	there was definitely a dent not a big dent but a dent i feel bad but the owners werent home and there was construction equipment anyway so the workers couldve done it i swear i was like the imposter on among us where i just drive away quickly onto the main street so its impossible i was there when it happened i know it sounds horrible but if nobody was there then nobody knows what happened and im the only one who knows so bam	aejux
482	I lied to my teacher about my father being terminally ill to get an extension	A few years ago, I walked into my classroom in the morning. I had been recently upset due to a relationship problem, and my eyes were red from crying. My teacher, whom I was much fond of, approached me to ask why I hadn’t handed in a huge assignment that had been due on that day. Frantically, not wanting to disappoint my teacher or bring down my grades, I decided to use my puffy eyes to my advantage. The first thing I could come up with was “my dad might have lung cancer…. I just found out”. My teacher’s harsh expression immediately melted into a sympathetic smile. She told me I could get as much time as I needed, and I thanked her. From that day until I graduated the year, said teacher was constantly asking me about my family situation, and i felt so heavily guilty about having lied about such a serious matter just to get out of doing work.	1ae59zg	i lied to my teacher about my father being terminally ill to get an extension	a few years ago i walked into my classroom in the morning i had been recently upset due to a relationship problem and my eyes were red from crying my teacher whom i was much fond of approached me to ask why i hadnt handed in a huge assignment that had been due on that day frantically not wanting to disappoint my teacher or bring down my grades i decided to use my puffy eyes to my advantage the first thing i could come up with was my dad might have lung cancer i just found out my teachers harsh expression immediately melted into a sympathetic smile she told me i could get as much time as i needed and i thanked her from that day until i graduated the year said teacher was constantly asking me about my family situation and i felt so heavily guilty about having lied about such a serious matter just to get out of doing work	aezg
483	I used to trick kids into trading their most valuable POKEMON cards for fake ones	"When I was a kid around the age of 9 or 10, I found myself captivated by the world of Pokémon. The colorful creatures and their battles captured my imagination, and I quickly became obsessed with the card game that accompanied the franchise. In a town in Virginia, I discovered a local bookstore that housed a passionate fan base for all things Pokémon. Little did I know, this would be the beginning of a journey filled with deception, greed, and ultimately, redemption. 

At first, it was innocent enough. My cousin and I would frequent the bookstore, spending our afternoons discussing strategy, trading cards, and making new friends within the community. We were young and impressionable, and we quickly became addicted to the thrill of acquiring rare and valuable Pokémon cards. As time went on, however, our hunger for the most sought-after cards began to outweigh our sense of morality. We started to realize that we could use our charm and knowledge of the game to manipulate others into trading their valuable cards with us. After all, these kids from rural Virginia had no idea what was actually worth on the collectible market, and they were eager to get their hands on any rare cards they could find. My cousin and I would show up at local tournaments and events, always dressed in our best Pokémon gear, ready to impress. We would make friends with the other kids, learning about their most prized possessions and which cards they were after. Then, we would subtly drop hints about our own rare and valuable cards, sparking jealousy and desire within our unsuspecting targets. Once we had them hooked, we would make an offer that was too good to refuse. We would tell them about a rare card or shiny Pokémon that we supposedly owned, and that we were willing to trade for their precious card. The other kids would be so excited at the prospect of obtaining such a valuable item, they would often accept our offers without even questioning the authenticity of our cards. With the help of my cousin, we had access to a bodega in New York City that sold fake Pokémon cards for a fraction of their real value. We would buy these fake cards by the dozens, bringing them back to Virginia to trade with the unsuspecting victims.

We never got caught or in any kind of trouble. My Pokémon card collection is well over $300,000

As I grew older, I began to see the error in my ways. I realized that I had not only taken advantage of others but had also betrayed the very community that had initially brought me so much joy. The thrill of the scam had clouded my judgment, and I had lost sight of what truly mattered in life."	1adz6zx	i used to trick kids into trading their most valuable pokemon cards for fake ones	"when i was a kid around the age of  or  i found myself captivated by the world of pokmon the colorful creatures and their battles captured my imagination and i quickly became obsessed with the card game that accompanied the franchise in a town in virginia i discovered a local bookstore that housed a passionate fan base for all things pokmon little did i know this would be the beginning of a journey filled with deception greed and ultimately redemption

I developed pancreatitis and had to have my gallbladder removed from that binge. Now I just smoke or should I say vape all the time. I am bipolar and have severe anxiety attacks. My meds are pretty good for it but weed just makes it even better. I know I need to go into treatment just not ready yet. And I smoke cigarettes (newports) and now I am developing copd.

485	I robbed a man at gunpoint in his vehicle in front of his girl.	"This happened about 2 years and some change ago. I was 17 at the time. I'm 19 now trying to turn my life around, but this was one of the many times I've committed a robbery with my brother, but one of the only times I've genuinely reflected and felt terrible because of the circumstances. Growing up, we had nothing. We both had problems with drugs, and we had to sell drugs and rob to be able to afford food for ourselves, otherwise it was raw spaghetti noodles or crackers and sometimes even drinking condiments just to stop the awful hunger pains. Me and my brother had been buying weed from this dude for about a year. Our former plug got arrested. He was about 25 years old or so and one day he tried to seriously tax me and my brother. Asking full 1,000 off the smack for a pound on what we thought was gonna be mid grade shit when me and my brother started off getting fronts and only having to pay back 700 to 800 per pound because we were buying in large amounts to sell. This made me extremely angry and I told my brother to tell him we wanted 2 pounds and that we were gonna jack him. Naturally, we had guns. When you sell drugs as your primary source of income, and lived where we lived, you were a idiot if you ain't have one. Anyway. We stopped by his house. He was going out of state for a few days and had just left the store so we had him pull up to his house to grab our shit and do the diddy in his car. He wanted us to get in his car. The usual routine. Me and my brother step in. I had a Glock 19x tucked in my pants under my hoodie and my brother had his little .22 pistol. The plug was in the driver's seat, and his old lady in the passenger. We had been buying from him for so long that he trusted us, and didn't usually carry his strap when we would come through. This day he didn't have it. He turned around and smiled at us and said this stuff he had was new and that he wanted us to smell it. He literally threw one of the pounds in my lap and me and my brother smelled it. The dude took a deep breath in and he sighed, then proceeded to talk about how his girl was pregnant, and that his other child had just been diagnosed with lukemia, and apologized for the prices and that he'd make it right for us in the future. When he was done talking about all that stuff, he started thanking us for listening to him. I started feeling so terrible and like there was a ball in my stomach. It got silent for a second, then he started to say something else, but before he was able to say anything else and make what I was about to do hurt worse, I tapped my brother and we both drew down on them. I remember every word he said and what I said like it was yesterday. I said ""I'm sorry dawg, but I need that. Please just give it to me and everything's gonna be straight."" Tears started rolling down this man's face and he literally just sighed with the most blank look on his face, then he chuckled in the most empty way and said ""You know what? Of course bro. Take it. You need it more than me."", threw it in the back seat without moving his blank gaze, and it took everything in my body not to shed a tear. His girl was screaming and crying in one of the most ear piercing ways I've heard someone cry before and begging us not to do anything that would harm her child and telling us that we were pieces of shit for doing what we were doing. Me and my brother said nothing, but I glanced over at him, and I could tell by the look on his face he felt exactly how I was feeling. I motioned my head towards my car. Then we ran to my car, and I drove off as fast as I could before he could go inside and get his gun. Me and my brother looked at each other after about 10 minutes of silence and I said ""That shit made me feel terrible dawg."" And he said ""I know. But {my name}, we can't just fucking starve."" Then, as a young adult, I finally understood how shitty and cut throat our world was and it made my heart hurt. We got home and went about our business, sold the stuff. Never mentioned it again. But it still hurts to this day knowing I probably seriously impacted that man and his family as well as his financial situation, who all needed him. Please don't do this shit. It sounds good in the music but that life really is rough and it never turns out good.

486	I ignored my friend’s attempt to reach out and I regret it.	"When I was in highschool I had this friend we’ll call him Ryan. Ryan was my age, he was outwardly gay (this is before gay marriage was legalized) we also lived in a small conservative town. Ryan and I weren’t super close, in fact we didn’t talk outside of school. I was just chill with him, especially since he was dating a guy I had been friends with for awhile. 

We met in class in 9th grade, he had been getting bullied for liking anime. At the time I hid the fact I liked anime from my friends but seeing him get bullied for it like I used to ticked me off and I stood up and argued with his bullies. From that point on we became friends. 

Although we didn’t speak a lot during the 10th grade Ryan would come to my math class to see his boyfriend. I sat in close proximity to his boyfriend and we’d all make idle conversation. Ryan was a very excitable guy, hyper but incredibly witty. 

Sometime in 10th grade his family got stationed out of state (he was a military brat). So before him and I got close he moved across the country. I’d ask his boyfriend how he was and from what I heard he was doing fine. 

Shortly after he moved I got a friend request on Facebook from a “Jake” confused I didn’t respond to it. That is until Ryan’s boyfriend informed me that “Jake” was Ryan’s secret Facebook acc since his parents didn’t allow him social media. Knowing that, I added him back. 

At this point Ryan had begun to reach out to me through this Facebook acc. At first it was minor nothing of note, a few comments here and there on my posts. Nothing you’d really respond to. Then he’d begun to message me. I’d reply here and there but I was never one to use fb messenger much so I tended to be bad at responding. This lead me to miss a handful of his messages reaching out to say hi. I’m not gonna lie, I might’ve also ignored some on purpose just not feeling up to responding. 

It wasn’t a big deal to me at the time. We weren’t close in the slightest. Ryan had never texted me before this point either. I figured he was just bored since he was new to his school. I figured he’d text his boyfriend if I didn’t reply or at least one of his other friends from my school.

Apparently Ryan and his boyfriend (my friend) broke up. They agreed the distance was too hard to maintain in highschool. They even agreed to try to find each other after hs. As for his other friends from my school he had reached out to them but no one responded. Not sure why, compared to me, his other friends were super close with him. 

I feel the need to emphasize that while I did consider him a friend we hardly talked even prior to his move. 

One day toward the end of 10th grade. I’m sitting in the class Ryan and I met in (a layered class) when the teacher comes in with a grim look on his face. He says he has an announcement for us. “Ryan has died, he committed xxx last night.” His mother had called the teachers to tell them to let us know so we could attend his funeral. 

Apparently after Ryan had moved he was never able to make new friends at his new school. In fact it was quite the opposite actually he had begun to get bullied quite harshly. Ryan and his family had moved to an even more conservative town in the Deep South. So he was one of a few poc and gay people in the town. I don’t know to what extent he was bullied but from what his ex boyfriend knew it was brutal. 

I felt and still feel immense guilt about this. Ryan had reached out to me after all and I ignored him. I never would’ve had I known what he was going through. What if I could’ve said something to prevent him from doing what he did. Almost 10 years later and this still haunts me. 

I didn’t attend his funeral because I felt I had no right to look his mother in the face and pretend him and I were super close. Pretend I didn’t ignore him. 

I’m 24 now and I still have the messages on fb messenger of when he reached out. I occasionally look at them. I wish I would’ve just responded, even if it wouldn’t have changed anything I still wish I would’ve. I’m sorry Ryan.

Edit: I really appreciate all the kind words I’ve been receiving in the comments💕 it’s definitely something I’m trying to move past. Originally when it all happen I tried to ignore it but it would come back in my mind every few months. Still at times does. Especially since despite being 15 at the time I had already talked various other people down from committing. I felt like I let him down for not being there. 

Ryan was one of the first queer friends I had growing up and unfortunately didn’t live to see me come out myself. But he definitely was apart of my journey and he always will be❤️
"	1ad8be4	i ignored my friends attempt to reach out and i regret it	"when i was in highschool i had this friend well call him ryan ryan was my age he was outwardly gay this is before gay marriage was legalized we also lived in a small conservative town ryan and i werent super close in fact we didnt talk outside of school i was just chill with him especially since he was dating a guy i had been friends with for awhile 

we met in class in th grade he had been getting bullied for liking anime at the time i hid the fact i liked anime from my friends but seeing him get bullied for it like i used to ticked me off and i stood up and argued with his bullies from that point on we became friends 

although we didnt speak a lot during the th grade ryan would come to my math class to see his boyfriend i sat in close proximity to his boyfriend and wed all make idle conversation ryan was a very excitable guy hyper but incredibly witty 

sometime in th grade his family got stationed out of state he was a military brat so before him and i got close he moved across the country id ask his boyfriend how he was and from what i heard he was doing fine 

shortly after he moved i got a friend request on facebook from a jake confused i didnt respond to it that is until ryans boyfriend informed me that jake was ryans secret facebook acc since his parents didnt allow him social media knowing that i added him back

487	I’ve stolen countless bottles of liquor from my parents	"Im 18 years old, and have always been that studious, rule following daughter my parents expected me to be. A while ago, my parents bought a new house, and we are still in the process of moving. My parents and brothers live in the new house, and I remained in the old. After a month of temporarily living alone, I had a random urge to see if they left their alcohol in the alcohol cabinet.
To my surprise I ended up giving into the urge of wanting to experience what being drunk was like that same night. A week later, I did it again, and the cycle started. All my friends had moved away to university, and they were getting drunk too. I felt like I was just being a typical teenager because of that.

When I threw up and blacked out for the first time, I started to question just how much I was drinking. The alcohol in the cabinet was disappearing slowly and I began to experience the shame and stress that keeps you up at night. I filled a bottle up with water, which came with instant regret. If they ever drank from that bottle, they would know.
 I have strict parents, and whenever they came to the old house to grab more belongings to transfer to the new, my fear they would open the cabinet and find alcohol missing gnawed at me. 
I was breaking out from stress, and I didn’t want them to see what kind of daughter I was behind the scenes. So I gave into this awful fear and told my mom a half-truth. That I had drank myself asleep once, and filled the bottle up with water after.
Because I confessed the truth, I was forgiven. My dad went through the liquor cabinet soon after. Which brings me to the root of my new problem. I never stopped. Sure, I had quit for a month, but I quickly finished three more bottles that are now hiding in my room for a fear they will find them in the garbage. A lot of bottles are a lot lower in liquor than they were when my dad checked. And a lot missing too, obviously. 
I’m not sure when they will go through the cabinet again, but if they realize something isn’t right, they will go through every journal, app, text message, device, to try and figure out why I did it. I obviously will never be allowed by myself, I will lose the privilege of having a space of my own. I think I screwed up lollll"	1acynv6	ive stolen countless bottles of liquor from my parents	"im  years old and have always been that studious rule following daughter my parents expected me to be a while ago my parents bought a new house and we are still in the process of moving my parents and brothers live in the new house and i remained in the old after a month of temporarily living alone i had a random urge to see if they left their alcohol in the alcohol cabinet

488	I reported my classmate because of what he was looking at on his computer	"So in my Algebra class there is this guy I sit next to. It started off just like any other day and class just started and the teacher hasn't gone up to the board and started teaching. The guy next to me, I happened to glance at his computer and saw him looking at something inappropriate. He was scrolling through photos,  of gay men, and I saw a one photo of two men holding hands, and they had a condom in the middle. Another photo I saw, there were two men were on top of each other. On one of the images he clicked on, it had a article that talked about sex. Just from where I was sitting it made me feel pretty uncomfortable. when class ended I went up and told the teacher about what happened and what I saw. And then I left to find the principal and report it.

I told him exactly what I told the teacher and what he was looking at, and then I said what he was looking at one his computer made me feel uncomfortable.

489	I purposefully drove into someone’s trash bin on the street	"When I was maybe 16 or 17, I would go to the skatepark almost every day and BMX or skate. I got really good at it and the positive is that biking is still a big part of my life and fitness. The negative was that my friends were bad influences and wreaking havoc on the public when we were outside the walls of the skatepark was a favorite past time of ours. 

One day I had a few friends in my old Toyota truck, and I remember we were trying to score some beer and driving thru neighborhoods around the skatepark we frequented (bay area). I was driving and it was trash day, so everyone had their trash bins in the street. I was an idiot, and craved attention, so when I saw what looked like a father and son jogging together, it clicked in my head that if I sped past them, I could create a “scene” if I drove my truck into the trash bins of a random house. I went by the joggers, and careened into three trash bins at once. I was going fairly quick, dented my bumper, and the bins went flying, pretty sure I broke them and rendered them useless. (Where would someone even get new ones? I’m such a dick) I looked in the rear view, and I’ll always remember the father of the two joggers, having just seen what I’d done, raise his arms in an exasperated and angry expression. Then he and his son picked up the trash bins. They were probably their own bins, or maybe their neighbor’s. 

I drove off laughing, feeing the adrenaline of being the biggest asshole of my friends…. I’ve changed a lot since then, now 28m, but I feel terrible for it. If I saw that now as a grown man, I would be so confused and furious."	1acpajj	i purposefully drove into someones trash bin on the street	"when i was maybe  or  i would go to the skatepark almost every day and bmx or skate i got really good at it and the positive is that biking is still a big part of my life and fitness the negative was that my friends were bad influences and wreaking havoc on the public when we were outside the walls of the skatepark was a favorite past time of ours

490	I steal glassware from different cafes and restaurant.

492	I broke my classmate's toy just for the sake of it and then attempted to accuse another kid of doing it	"My story was from long ago, so I don’t remember many things, for which I am sorry.

It was my first or second grade at school. I was the sort of ""quiet kid"". After lessons I usually sat alone or walked across corridors, not talking to anybody.

One day, my classmate - let's call him Nick - brought a Bionicle toy (for context, it must have been 2009-2010). I saw him playing with it, surrounded by a goup of other kids while we were at the beginning of a break between classes. A couple of minutes passed, and Nick decided to eat some food in our school canteen, others followed him. Our teacher also left for a break, so in the class there was only me and some other kid (Daniel).

Before leaving, Nick put his Bionicle toy on a table and didn't take it with himself. As soon as they went out of the room, I walked to Nick's desk, grabbed his Bionicle toy, threw it on a floor and started jumping on it, breaking it into halves. After that I stood up, stooped, grabbed its remains and put them back on the table, stone-faced and completely silent.

Now, Daniel, who sat at the other corner of the room and whom I hadn't noticed or taken into consideration before breaking the toy, saw me doing this. As I remember it, he said that he was going to tell Nick about this and ran to the corridor. Both furious and afraid, I pursued him. When I managed to get to Daniel, he was already standing near Nick and pointing his finger at me. Even before either of them said anything to me, I started accusing Daniel of breaking a toy. When Nick, who was not convinced, asked me why I did it, I said it was an accident and I stepped on it because it had already been on the floor and I didn’t notice it.

Eventually, Nick saw his toy broken and my mom had to pay their family to buy a new one.

It breaks my heart sometimes to this day that Nick was not at all angry at me, he was just very sad about his toy. Also, he didn’t bear a grudge on me. I didn’t deserve this.

In addition, I am sorry to say it but I think that when I chased Daniel who wanted to report my action to Nick, I was intending to either beat him or threaten him.

Naturally, I would not allow myself to do any of these things today. I am frankly scared of myself as a child. Like I said, I was quiet, very obedient to teachers and extremely introverted. To this day I have absolutely no clue of what my motivation was (me and Nick never had any coflicts at all) or what I felt when I did my wrongdoing

As an adult  am genuinely spooked by it. It seems so out of blue and at the same time so psychopathic. I clearly remember the sequence of my actions and that I did it in a very clear state of mind. I 100% wanted to do this and expressed no visible emotions while in action, as if it was normal or planned.

All in all, I am sorry and I am glad grew up into an empathetic and friendly person."	1abxwda	i broke my classmates toy just for the sake of it and then attempted to accuse another kid of doing it	"my story was from long ago so i dont remember many things for which i am sorry

493	I drove an ATV thru someone’s fence then drove away	"This was some years ago but I haven’t really told anyone about it. 

It was late at night during a blizzard and as usual my two buddies and I would bust out the ATVs. There was this large water retention basin behind a residential development. It was huge and very deep. We’d ride full throttle up the walls like it was a race track with banked corners. I had my friend on the back of the ATV I was driving and the other guy was on his own ATV. 

We would play games like ‘tag’ (without actual contact, but just getting close enough to each other counted as a tag). He was chasing me so in an attempt to get away I drove full throttle up the side and never let off the gas. I forgot which direction I was facing (two of the sides of the basin had flat ground at the top, the other two sides immediately dropped back down behind the berm). I had driven up the side where the ground dropped back down. We were going so fast that the entire ATV left the ground for what felt like an eternity and we landed feet from a fence.

The ground was so slippery that I couldn’t stop in time and we blew thru this residential fence sliding almost all the way onto their back porch. The fence was in 100 pieces and the entire plastic front end of the ATV was crack. The scattered fence debris looked like a stampede had just come thru their back yard. I threw the ATV into reverse and got out of there as fast as possible and drove home. 

The fence wasn’t fixed for months but it did eventually get repaired."	1ablabf	i drove an atv thru someones fence then drove away	"this was some years ago but i havent really told anyone about it

494	I lied about being assaulted (not in the way you think)	"When I was younger, some age before 6, I was assaulted. 

My family minus my dad were visiting a family friend, and because we lived so far away, we were staying with her and her husband in their house. It was summer and we hadn’t seen them in a long time, so my mom planned to stay for about 2 weeks.

We weren’t technically related, but I called the family friend aunt and her husband by his name. I don’t actually remember much about the husband, just that he was super nice me to and gave me a lot of attention. I had middle kid syndrome, so it was nice that an adult actually wanted to talk to me. Whenever I could, I’d spend time with him and be practically glued to his side, and he always said how much he loved having me around and how much he missed me when I wasn’t there. I was so stupid.

I don’t remember when it started, but at some point during the visit he began assaulting me. At first I was just confused and didn’t understand what he was doing. He was acting so normal about it and I trusted him, so I didn’t say anything. Eventually, I got really uncomfortable and asked to do something else, but he just kept telling me I’d like it and I’d make him sad if I didn’t. Then it just got worse. 

It happened almost everyday, weather he was assaulting me or forcing me to perform “acts” for him. I’ve mostly blocked out the memory, but some are just too vivid to forget. I have no idea where my family was during all these times, because it was often in the middle of the day. I guess no one was paying attention to my change in behavior. 

Before we went back home, he made me promise not to tell anyone or else I would be in trouble, which I remember confused me because he had told me we weren’t doing anything wrong.

Once back home several states away, I would have night terrors and wet myself for months. I hated being touched and I’d make my sister sit in the bathroom with me while I showered because I was scared. Still no one payed attention to the signs.

A few years ago, my mother tearfully told me the husband had been convicted of assault and possession of cp and was facing up to 40 years. Apparently I hadn’t been the first kid and I wasn’t the last. 

She asked me if he had ever touched me inappropriately and all I could think was “that would be an understatement” 
I looked my mom in the eyes and told her he hadn’t and left it at that. We haven’t talked about it since then, but I think about it even more than I did before she told me. I can’t help but feel that maybe if I had told her in the very beginning, when it first happened, maybe he wouldn’t have hurt anyone else."	19ex5f2	i lied about being assaulted not in the way you think	"when i was younger some age before  i was assaulted

495	When I was 15 I drove a car full of people high on mescaline.	"I had older friends, who had cars. We decided one night while hanging out we would drive almost two hours away for a festival. There was music, drugs, and people were trading different things. I traded my shoes for a drop from a vile. I was told it was peyote. I got this as the night was winding down. I took it and waited an hour before deciding it was bunk. My friends all agreed I should drive since everyone was intoxicated and I didn’t drink (and supposedly had bunk drugs). I started driving and about an hour in I got crazy high. Hallucinating the road moving around, and just completely not okay to drive. I didn’t think I could stop so I went all the way to my friends house to ride out the rest of my trip. Looking back at people I could have hurt or felonies I could have gotten makes me feel sick. The invincibility fable is very true. Drugs are bad mmkay?

496	I used to rip up all of my neighbors mail growing up as a child.	"When I (25F) was younger (maybe around 10-12F), I would used to do what every child would when they grew up, and ride bikes around the neighborhood. 
I don’t know what possessed my mind to do this, but there was a point in time where I would ride around, stop in front of peoples mailboxes, open them, rip their mail in half, close the box, and speed off. 
I would do it to multiple boxes, in different parts of the neighborhood. 
I never got caught, and its not that i did it much, maybe about 2-3 days back to back. 
Eventually I got the sense that it was wrong, and completely stopped, but I really don’t know what would have possessed me to do that in the first place.
I just hope that I didn’t rip up anything too important, like bills or a special letter.

497	In high school, I (30M) used illegal drugs regularly, and I started early	"I'll break this down into chapters for clarity.

**Intro**I grew up in the most affluent sect of \[city\], TX, with loving parents and a large family. Attended the best private schools for middle school and high school, and had an abundance of friends. There are 3 major private high schools in \[city\], where pretty much everyone knows everyone or is connected to some degree by family and friends. As I've grown up and shared stories of my high school experience with others, I've felt more and more like it was totally messed up and not the typical teenage antics I thought it to be.I'll start with 8th grade.

**8th Grade: Alcohol & Weed**The first time I drank was the summer going into 8th grade. I can't put my finger on the reason or motivation, but I vividly remember having a sleepover and just deciding we were going to try to drink. It was port/sherry from my parents pantry (thought it was whiskey or rum at the time). From that point, for the rest of 8th grade, we occasionally raided our parent's liquor supply at sleepovers, usually just acting like idiots or getting sick.As 8th grade comes to an end, about 90% of my group of friends was set to attend the same high school. Around this time, again with no specific infighting event that I can remember, we decided we wanted to try smoking weed. So we did. I found it and bought the classic overpriced $60 eighth, and we smoked it out of a ""bong"" made of a gatorade bottle, a pen tube, and tinfoil.\*\*Freshman Yr: Psychedelic Mushrooms (+ Alcohol, Weed)\*\*First semester of freshman year, I and two friends of mine took shrooms for the first time. Again, sought them out ourselves and took them at one of our houses at a sleepover. This experience was very jarring, as we were 14/15 years old, and took about 4 grams each. If you've never done psychedelics, there is no possible way you can imagine how significantly your perception of reality can be warped and transcended by a natural substance. So, yeah, that was intense. Great experience there though.Through freshman year we stuck with weed and alcohol, but definitely started expressing curiosity about other things.

**Sophomore Yr: Rx Painkillers and Xanax, MDMA/Molly, Mushrooms, Weed, Alcohol**Summer going into sophomore year was the first time I took what I consider ""hard drugs."" I got a bottle of hydrocodone syrup after having my tonsils removed. So, being from \[city\], the first thing we thought to do was try ""sipping lean"" and ""draping"" a blunt (lean is codeine mixed with spite and jolly rancher, but hydrocodone is much stronger; ""draping"" means coating a blunt in the same opioid syrup and smoking it).In this same month, we got ahold of some Xanax, which we were eager to try. The first time I did it was during summer school class. I crushed 3/4 of a Xanax bar into power, rolled it into a thin piece of toilet paper, and swallowed it (this is called ""parachuting,"" which causes the drug to take effect exponentially faster since it is already powdered and does not need to dissolve.) Made a fool of myself at lunch after class, and got dropped off at home without issue, but don't remember the rest of that day.We continued with these two substances + the routine weed and alcohol.All of this stayed seemingly consistent through sophomore and junior year, with some increase in frequency and perceived normalcy as more of us got driver's licenses and cars, and parties became more common for us.

**Summer before Junior Year** \- I'd become so comfortable with this lifestyle that I became super careless. At any given time there was a 95% chance I had weed, alcohol, pills, or evidence thereof in my car. I smoked weed every day before and after school; and if I didn't have weed at the end of the day for bed, it was a crisis.Then I got arrested and put on probation w/ drug testing. Here's the messed up thing about drug testing: it only stops you from using weed. Everything else gets out of your system after 3-5 days, and I always knew when my probation check-ins were. So everything else stayed fair game. This was bad.

**\*\*Senior Year: Cocaine, Xanax, Hydrocodone, Codeine, Adderall, MDMA, LSD, Weed, Alcohol.\*\***

I would say that my senior year in high school was perhaps the most unhinged as far as substance abuse. Although much of it continued through college, we had a better grasp on what we were dealing with and what we didn't care for.\*\*\*

Here are the frequencies of use for each vice during senior year, as an 18yo:

\**Weed and Adderal - before school, a lot after school, and before bed.*

*Alcohol, Cocaine or Adderal - every weekend (Fri-Sun); about 4 days/week during grad party season*

*Xanax and painkillers -* almost every weekend.*LSD -* tried 1st time, loved it, great drug.

*MDMA -* every concert, some grad parties.

By this point, we knew where to get anything and were as comfortable as anyone could ever be with doing it. The only things we hadn't touched, and never had a desire to were heroin, meth, and PCP.A lot of us continued through college together.

In college, weed remained a daily staple; alcohol was definitely every weekend and a lot of week days. Cocaine was a given for every function, and even just Sunday night football on the couch. LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA were for concerts, bro trips, and major parties. Xanax and painkillers became less common because taking them guarantees, at best, you're sleeping alone that night, or worse, you're waking up in jail or with a phone full of burned bridges and missed calls.I've never met someone outside of the group I grew up with who had a similar experience. For the most part, people either haven't experimented with anything until college, or somehow avoided everything, or have only ever engaged in socially acceptable drinking (and some pot).

498	Sold charity wrist bands and pocketed the money from it, not all but a significant amount at 14-15yo	"I made a shit ton of money, thousands. The £ to $ used to be about £1:$2

I started off buying directly from livestrong about $200 worth for 200 bands after carriage it cost me between £120-£150

I then sold them for £5-£8 a pop in school
I then found on eBay someone selling thousands of livestrong bands for even less, I did the same with these lot.

Then the blue beat bullying bands came out which were given away for free, all I had to do was one name written into a radio station.
I sent various bob smith, bobby smith, etc and within a few days I had close to a hundred arrive all for free. I sold these for £6-£10.

The pinnacle of my selling was when I got collared by a teacher and taken to the staff room “you’re selling those live strong bands aren’t you?”
“Ye” “how much ?” “£7”
“I’ll have one”(the other teacher) “get me one too”

My dad has always thought that someone else had hit the truck. Granted he wasnt that upset I don't think.

503	I got my step mom in trouble for watering down my dad’s alcohol.	"This happened a few years back, but I still feel really guilty about it. 

My dad is an alcoholic. He’s been sober just over a year now, but before then, it was very hard to live with him. He wasn’t physically abusive by any means, but he would always mumble under his breath, calling us slobs or just expressing his irritation with how we exist around him. 

He always kept his mini bottles, and vodka (his preferred drink) in the kitchen cabinet. One day I woke up around 10am and he was wasted, already. I was genuinely worried about him and checked the cabinet where I found a half empty bottle of vodka. I’ve watched my step mom replace some alcohol with water, and decided to take matters into my own hands this time. (I didn’t want him going back to the hospital for what felt like the 100th time from alcohol poisoning).

I wasn’t sure how much to replace and this is where I definitely messed up. I figured alcohol is strong enough to flavor a good amount of water. (I’ve drank a few times, but not enough to get drunk as I’m terrified of the addiction). I replaced half of what’s in the bottle with water after pouring some alcohol out, and put it back in the cabinet.

I watched him, not even 10 minutes later come into the kitchen and take a sip of his vodka. He was fuming. His went into his and my step mom’s room and yelled at her for a solid 20 minutes. 

I felt terrible, but didn’t say anything as I already have low self esteem (due to my drunk father) and didn’t want to feel lower than low again. 

(disclaimer: I am now 18, but 14 or 15 during this time. My dad is sober as of 1 year and a few months. I attend all-anon meetings, and therapy for the mental distress from his period of drinking. My dad is an amazing man, just not so great when he was drunk.)"	19d53xz	i got my step mom in trouble for watering down my dads alcohol	"this happened a few years back but i still feel really guilty about it

504	I used to steal candy from my teacher that she used to reward good behaviour for	"Okay so my classroom in elementary always had a jar full of candies that my teacher would keep on her desk to give out to kids who behaved well, did good work, or maybe scored higher than usual on the weekly spelling test. 

During lunchtimes I would ask to go to the toilet while everyone was outside. I never did. They never kept classrooms locked in my school so when I was “going to the toilet” I really just used to go to my teacher’s desk and take a handful of candy. 

My teacher obviously noticed that candy was disappearing quicker than she was giving it out and she asked whoever it was to confess. I never came forward, and as a result she stopped having the candy jar. I felt bad for a couple years afterwards but don’t really anymore because it was 20 years ago."	19c3iq6	i used to steal candy from my teacher that she used to reward good behaviour for	"okay so my classroom in elementary always had a jar full of candies that my teacher would keep on her desk to give out to kids who behaved well did good work or maybe scored higher than usual on the weekly spelling test

I had a textbook for a fairly popular class. I ended up losing it and I panicked. I didn’t want to tell my parents they were shelling out money for a replacement textbook. I ended up finding someone else’s book and hatched a plan. I took out the barcode put in by the school. It was just a sticker so it was easy to remove. I was going to turn that book in at the end of the year and say I bought a replacement because I lost mine. 

It never ended up coming to that. A little while later, I ended up finding my book. I just turned my book in at the end of the year. I threw the book that I stole in the trash and never looked back. 

I still feel guilty. Some poor kid probably got yelled at by his parents when they had to pay for the book.

506	When I was in 1st grade, I would steal stuff from kids’ desks	Everytime we had a project or activity, my first grade teacher would let us sit on random desks. Our desks were open front so everytime I saw one of my classmates get a new toy, sticker, or eraser and put it inside their desks, I would discretely approach their desk and take the toy or whatever item I found was interesting or cool looking. For some reason nobody complained that stuff went missing from their desks. I remember a kid got the Lego Star Wars Character Encyclopedia that had a Han Solo minifigure packaged inside. When I sat on his desk for an activity I removed the minifigure from the package. Later I saw him check out his book and he noticed someone ripped the minifigure off, he didn’t even tell the teacher, he just looked a little sad but I guess he moved on from it. After that I stopped doing it because I felt guilty and because I just simply didn’t want to steal anymore. I find this a little bit funny now that I’m 19 but I kind of do feel a little bad sometimes lol.	19bh2sj	when i was in st grade i would steal stuff from kids desks	everytime we had a project or activity my first grade teacher would let us sit on random desks our desks were open front so everytime i saw one of my classmates get a new toy sticker or eraser and put it inside their desks i would discretely approach their desk and take the toy or whatever item i found was interesting or cool looking for some reason nobody complained that stuff went missing from their desks i remember a kid got the lego star wars character encyclopedia that had a han solo minifigure packaged inside when i sat on his desk for an activity i removed the minifigure from the package later i saw him check out his book and he noticed someone ripped the minifigure off he didnt even tell the teacher he just looked a little sad but i guess he moved on from it after that i stopped doing it because i felt guilty and because i just simply didnt want to steal anymore i find this a little bit funny now that im  but i kind of do feel a little bad sometimes lol	bhsj

508	I lied about an injury, ended up actually saving me from permanent damage to my ankle	When I was about 7, I was moving to a new house with my family. I tripped and rolled my ankle in the bathroom and it kind of hurt but the pain went away after a few hours, but as a dumb and lazy kid I decided to lie and say it still hurt really bad to get out of packing to move out, kept this act on for about a week and my mom decided I needed to go to the doctor to make sure I didn’t sprain my ankle or anything, my little 7 year old self started to panic a bit because I really felt no pain at all, but I thought I was to deep into the lie to back out by then. we went to the doctor and did an x-ray, and I was thinking “I’m screwed, i’m perfectly fine and this x-ray will just prove i’m lying”, results came back and I was thinking I was about to get in big time trouble for lying about something so serious, only for the doctor to say I fractured my ankle. apparently I was going on for days with a fractured ankle that didn’t hurt whatsoever and didn’t realize, I had to wear a boot for the entire summer. I felt guilty for lying about it for the longest time, but if I didn’t I could have seriously messed up my ankle, now I laugh thinking of it since it’s such a stupid story, no one except for me knows that I lied about this and I don’t know if I ever will tell my parents. Probably one of the more tame confessions here but definitely a strange one I thought I should share, I really don’t know why my ankle didn’t hurt.	19awsny	i lied about an injury ended up actually saving me from permanent damage to my ankle	when i was about  i was moving to a new house with my family i tripped and rolled my ankle in the bathroom and it kind of hurt but the pain went away after a few hours but as a dumb and lazy kid i decided to lie and say it still hurt really bad to get out of packing to move out kept this act on for about a week and my mom decided i needed to go to the doctor to make sure i didnt sprain my ankle or anything my little  year old self started to panic a bit because i really felt no pain at all but i thought i was to deep into the lie to back out by then we went to the doctor and did an xray and i was thinking im screwed im perfectly fine and this xray will just prove im lying results came back and i was thinking i was about to get in big time trouble for lying about something so serious only for the doctor to say i fractured my ankle apparently i was going on for days with a fractured ankle that didnt hurt whatsoever and didnt realize i had to wear a boot for the entire summer i felt guilty for lying about it for the longest time but if i didnt i could have seriously messed up my ankle now i laugh thinking of it since its such a stupid story no one except for me knows that i lied about this and i dont know if i ever will tell my parents probably one of the more tame confessions here but definitely a strange one i thought i should share i really dont know why my ankle didnt hurt	awsny
509	I claimed a prize that was not mine when I was a kid	"So when I was around 11, me and my mom went to see my little brother play hockey at the arena. We could register to win 100$ by bying a small ticket with a number on it and they would do a draw then give the 100$ to the person with the matching ticket numbers.

The thing is, my mom asked me to hold her ticket while she was searching her purse, but I gave her my initial ticket back. Guess what number came up in the draw? Mine (my mothers initially). So I claimed the prize and never told her that it was her ticket in the first place.

Mind you my mom was a bit struggling financially during this time and she even told me that a 100$ would be great for her (she told me this after I ""won"" the money). Anyway, I still feel bad even after 15 years. I shouldve give it to her. I don’t even remember what I did with the money.

510	I lied to my parents about my grades for years when they were paying for it.	"I am currently doing a second degree which is going much better. My parents are also paying for that. So blessed! I’m actually getting interviews for jobs and internships this time. 

Ok so, first time I went to college I went straight to university and did poorly. As I’m barely above a 2. I would tell my parents that I was getting A’s and B’s when I was actually on academic probation. I kept lying to them about it only this time I managed to pull it up to something okayish (2.9). After Year 4 I stopped going to class and my gpa plummeted all the way down to 2.3. Keep in mind that it took me 7 years to get my degree. When I graduated I didn’t bother to use my degree."	19a34pm	i lied to my parents about my grades for years when they were paying for it	"i am currently doing a second degree which is going much better my parents are also paying for that so blessed im actually getting interviews for jobs and internships this time

511	when i was in second grade i stole money from this one kid in my class	"this one kid in my class always brought like two to three, maybe even four dollars in quarters every day. i think it was to pay off his lunch debt or buy lunch, which was strange because he always brought packed lunch. 

he always kept the quarters in one of the side pockets of his lunchbox, and he always kept the lunchbox in his locker. i asked to go to the bathroom, went to his locker, and stole like two dollars in quarters. then at lunch i bought myself some brownies"	199jxjz	when i was in second grade i stole money from this one kid in my class	"this one kid in my class always brought like two to three maybe even four dollars in quarters every day i think it was to pay off his lunch debt or buy lunch which was strange because he always brought packed lunch

512	I lied I got accepted into college now I’m living in a city alone.	"I 20F, lied about getting accepted into college, now I’m in a big city living alone. 

I need somewhere to let this out. I have been waking up with a constant worry or unsureness, heavy feeling, upset stomach. I don’t know how to put my finger on it nor describe it. I did everything I could to move out and start a new life. I guess it’s just not going my way right now. I dreamt of going to this college since 9th grade but I didn’t think I was gonna get accepted so I went to another college. I had a very sheltered life so I ended up back at home. But it was a very toxic environment and my mothers and I relationship suffered for the last two years.

So I saved up and applied to start college for spring semester, everything was cut so short because of my abrupt leave at my previous university. I found an apartment and got a job and waited/ prayed for an acceptance letter. I knew I would’ve been moved in before I could register for classes, but as classes started, I got my answer back, denied. 

Yep, now I’m in a new city next to a college campus with no friends. I’m so grateful that I have a way to stay afloat. I’m so grateful that I have new opportunities to experience, but is this the way it supposed to go? Should I have stayed home worked out some thing else and then moved out? I just wasn’t happy there. I thought I could be happy here because this is a city that I’ve always wanted to be, or that I’d be in classes and I can meet people on campus,clubs,dining hall.. but how do I start a life now?
I’m just a 20 year old teenage girl in a big city with no plans now. And I did that to myself, so where the hell do I go now? And this has been haunting me for the past week. 

I’ve been waking up and working out, about to start my new day at my job. I also have a remote job so I’ve been inside a lot.  I have roommates, but they all think I’m in college. I just feel stuck.

Edit/updated: First of all I wanna appreciate everybody that commented and left advice. I really appreciate it. I read every comment and it really gave me more drive to figure out myself in this new city. I wanted to answer your questions/assumptions. 

First, I come from a single parent household, my mom has done so much for me. But as I got older, I realized I did a lot for her. I am the oldest daughter out of six kids. I didn’t really have a life outside of home. It was my mothers way or the highway. I appreciate my mom but I can’t live for her anymore or watch my siblings 24/7, can’t hang out with friends cause she would be calling me telling me to come home. When I went to university my freshman year, I was so sheltered/socially anxious that I made so many stupid decisions. For my safety for myself, I just went home. For the last two years, 18 to 20, I realize if I have to live life for myself or I’ll forever be living for my mother. My mother and I relationship is already benefiting from the distance that we have from each other. I will be looking into community college out here since I am right next to campus I thought about going to advisor and talking about steps for an appeal. 

As for staying afloat, I pay all my bills myself, my car, rent, utilities etc except for my phone bill now that I think about it lol. I appreciate my mom for teaching me my work ethic. I also wouldn’t have the remote job that pays me really good if it wasn’t for my mom… because my boss is her friend lol. Then I also have a serving job that I start tomorrow. 

I appreciate the advice on going on a self discovery journey. I think that opened up my mind to more of just making friends and experiencing the city with others. Cheers to starting my adult life.

513	I stole a small item from work and I still think about it.	"I used to work a job, asshole boss, whatever. An old keyboard caught my eye and I ended up taking it home to clean up. I ended up keeping it because I liked it, but I no longer use it. I think values of them are around $30-40.

Looking back I wish I asked if I could have taken it and I think about it somewhat often. I also worry that they know and that it could resurface someday.

514	I stole a computer from a bar when I was very drunk	"So, when I was around 19 years old I moved to another country to pursue college education since in my country is way more expensive to be able to get a degree from a good university. When I arrived to the country I moved to I had pretty much no money, I was working at a job that paid a really horrible salary (barely enough to pay my rent) and my mental health was going to shit. One day I watched the Joker movie and most of the movie really spoke to me, it fed into that ""I'm tired of everything"" mentality that I was having at the time so that same day at night I got absolutely blasted and went inside of a bar. I stayed inside the place debating to steal a laptop that they were using to play music, at first I was kind of scared but the alcohol helped me calm my nerves. Eventually the owner started closing the place down and asking people to leave, at that moment I quickly grabbed the laptop put it inside my jacket and left the place running. I lived nearby so I just got to my house, turned off the computer and tried to go to sleep despite feeling adrenaline all over my body. The next day I woke up and felt really shitty, I regretted so much stealing the computer that a couple of weeks from that day I went to the same place hoping that they wouldn't recognise me and left the laptop inside one of the bathrooms. For a while I was very paranoid walking around my neighborhood because I believed everyone was warching me, but after returning the computer I started to feel a little bit less guilty and I promised myself to never do such a thing again."	198h7nk	i stole a computer from a bar when i was very drunk	so when i was around  years old i moved to another country to pursue college education since in my country is way more expensive to be able to get a degree from a good university when i arrived to the country i moved to i had pretty much no money i was working at a job that paid a really horrible salary barely enough to pay my rent and my mental health was going to shit one day i watched the joker movie and most of the movie really spoke to me it fed into that im tired of everything mentality that i was having at the time so that same day at night i got absolutely blasted and went inside of a bar i stayed inside the place debating to steal a laptop that they were using to play music at first i was kind of scared but the alcohol helped me calm my nerves eventually the owner started closing the place down and asking people to leave at that moment i quickly grabbed the laptop put it inside my jacket and left the place running i lived nearby so i just got to my house turned off the computer and tried to go to sleep despite feeling adrenaline all over my body the next day i woke up and felt really shitty i regretted so much stealing the computer that a couple of weeks from that day i went to the same place hoping that they wouldnt recognise me and left the laptop inside one of the bathrooms for a while i was very paranoid walking around my neighborhood because i believed everyone was warching me but after returning the computer i started to feel a little bit less guilty and i promised myself to never do such a thing again	hnk
515	i grabbed my moms arm and threw her to the corner of the door where she hit her forehead	"i recently turned 18 and i just fucked up real bad. i’m not a man. i’m fucking ashamed and i want to commit after this shit. my childhood friends were over a few nights ago, but i was upset with them because of the way they were treating my dog and my home. i didn’t want to hangout with them as i told them to leave, but my sister insisted on them staying. i continued to feed my computer addiction by sitting alone in my office grinding video games. my mom then came in and told me to goto applebees with them. i told her no, and she kept bugging me (as a good mother should)

this is where shit really happens

she unplugs my computer and in a quick flash i grabbed her arm and threw her into the wall. i didn’t believe i did it hard, but i did it.

my mom is the most loving mother in the world. she’s a single mom who works her fucking ass off every damn day for my sister and i. and i just threw dirt and did the most disgusting act i could’ve done to her. she never deserved this, i’m here to protect her. i’m the only man in my house and this is what i do. i’m so fucking confused on how i could ever rationally put my hands on a woman let alone my own mother. 

 i felt nothing. i wasn’t angry, upset, or annoyed, it was a quick action.

why did i do it?

i’m addicted to my games. i feel like an ipad kid. i’m a fucking loser who hits his mom because she wanted him off the electronics to goto dinner with his friends. 

i just fucked my whole life up

i can’t believe i’d ever do such a thing.

Edit: I apologized to my mother with my full heart. I will never commit, as I was reminded that will only hurt my mother even more. What she needs to see is me grow and learn from this rock bottom. This is my catalyst to my next journey. I won’t let this event define me for who I am, for I’m lucky enough to not goto prison for it. I will show my mother what she deserves for working so hard for me to live a better life than she did. Thank you all for your comments, not a single one that I disagreed with. 

Edit 2: For more background info, I do have a father, I just don’t live with him. He called me yesterday since my sister told him. Dishes crashed and my ears became deaf through the phone. Screaming and yelling is all I remember. But from all of this, I realized that I don’t have to weep and sorrow. There are people who love me and believe in me that I could change. I believe in myself. Not all of that, but thanks to all of you, and every single comment whether harsh, or too kind, they’ve pushed me to go farther. I’ll be using this momentum. Again, thank you all for your guidance, thoughts, and opinions.

516	I was a thief growing up, but I grew out of it eventually.	"I grew up with some intrinsic urge to steal. Started young, taking change off the counter, a couple dollars from my mom's wallet. Then shoplifting candy bars and CDs from a local record shop. When CDs were popular, they would package them in these tall thin plastic packaging (anti-theft, no doubt). I'd slip the whole thing down my pants. I also stole some CDs from people I knew.

In high school, I got kicked out after my first year at a new school because I stole from my roommate. They roomed me with this rich Japanese kid who never went to class, and flaunted his wealth. I felt like why did he get to enjoy everything and not even have to go to class? But I do? I would steal Japanese yen from him, then go to the local bank and exchange for dollars. Kind of ambitious and a little fucked up. I got busted, somehow. Dad wanted to kill me. By an act of God they let me back in the next year. I was known as that kid who stole. People talked about me behind my back, and some teachers really didn't like me. They thought I should not have been allowed back in to the school, a fair point. But in the end I needed tobe in that school and I ended up graduating. In the end it was fine. Never saw that Japanese kid again.

In college I snuck into someone's room and stole some sunglasses and various other small items. I think they found it, but it was like the last day of school before everyone left.

I don't know why honestly... I think I always felt like I was lacking. Saw things I wanted but didn't have. Although I came from a middle class background and never really lacked anything essential. My parents never gave me any pocket money. So as a kid, what do you do? My friends all had money. So from 14 on I had part time jobs. I worked at a seafood market. I worked at a mafia owned Italian restaurant. I delivered medicine to elderly homes. I worked at Baskin & Robbins. And numerous other restaurant jobs in my teens.

When I got to college, on the very first day I went to the job fair to get a job because my parents gave me no cash for anything. I don't know what they thought I was supposed to do. They thought since the cafeteria was included, I had food and shelter, why would I need money? Who knows. My first job at college was at the library for $4.25 an hour. Worked all through college.

After college I tried to steal from batteries from CVS and got totally busted by security. They made me pay a $200 fine on the spot, or risk arrest. So I said I'm sorry, paid, and that was that. But I knew I never wanted to get in any real trouble with the law. Essentially I am not a criminal or a bad person. I just had this problem.

Then I changed, in my early 20s.

I did a year abroad in France in college. Saw the world in a different way. Had new experiences. I was humbled and intrigued by a big new world. Not sure exactly why, but I went through a transformation. And I never stole again. I grew out of it. It just became...wrong.

One of my best friends from high school, we reconnected and lived near each other a few years later in Boston. This is mid 90s now. It was good times there for a bit. But then, an incident occurred. Someone stole some music equipment from his housemate. I knew who did it, it was my other best friend. We were all a group. This guy was starting to have mental health issues and ended up schizophrenic. But that's another story. However, my friend thought I stole the equipment. It was an obvious conclusion because of what happened in high school. But I didn't do it. Actually I would never have stolen hundreds of dollars of hardware from anyone. That was beyond my ambitions, and very risky. Although he never confronted me, that ended our friendship. At that point I had ended my petty thievery, but the stigma was on me.

I'm lucky I never got in more trouble than I did. Since that time I have never stolen anything again. It just didn't interest me anymore. It was wrong. I wouldn't have wanted things stolen from me, so I had more perspective and compassion as I matured.

I just... grew out of it. I never wanted to hurt anyone. At this point I'm the most honest person you will ever meet. 

Anyway, this is something I have never spoken about with anyone really. People think if you were a thief then, you are always a thief. So if it ever came up for whatever reason, it's like a stigma over your head.

Anyway that's my confession."	198bbxh	i was a thief growing up but i grew out of it eventually	"i grew up with some intrinsic urge to steal started young taking change off the counter a couple dollars from my moms wallet then shoplifting candy bars and cds from a local record shop when cds were popular they would package them in these tall thin plastic packaging antitheft no doubt id slip the whole thing down my pants i also stole some cds from people i knew

517	I lied to my long distance partner and friends about who I am	"Hey, I'm Sam. Around three years ago I met someone through the internet, after a while, I completely fell in love with him, we even ended up dating. But there's something I've been doing from the start, I've been lying about who I am. I sent fake pictures, even fake voice messages for years to him and my friends. I don't know how I was capable of doing it for so long. Mainly because of how close we all were. It started to get to me, eat me from the inside. So I decided it would be great to tell them about who I really am, and finally, be honest. There was a lot of tears from both sides. But I did it. I finally told them the truth and it felt really good. My friend took it okay, which I'm to this day surprised of. And even my partner did, which I was extremely happy for. But was he really okay?

It turns out he wasn't, not at all. It hurt him a lot. And I hate the fact that I hurt him. After all, I made him fall in love with someone else. He lost a huge amount of trust for me which I admit, is valid. I tried to make it better, somehow, but I knew the mental scar will always be there, for both of us. After a while it even started to look okay, I was being all honest, and no more lies, but it was still bothering him a lot. He ended up losing his feelings for me partially and breaking up with me, but said it'd be cool to still stay friends.

My now ex partner was still someone I loved though. I could not move on so quickly, and I still didn't. His trust for me began to disappear as well, to the point he thought I was cheating on him with my friend. I think it's fair to state I used to be in a romantic relationship with ""that friend"" but it barely lasted a year, I do not feel any romantic attraction to him right now (I consider him as my family and he has a girlfriend) and my partner knew him well, and knew we used to date. That's why I thought it'd be okay. My partner was worried about me cheating on him many times, I always reassured him. I never cheated on him and never had anyone in my mind other than him. 

Another thing, me and my now ex used to match profile pictures on basically every platform we used, which of course had to go after we broke up. Like a month after the break up, my friend he was worried about asked me if I'd like to match (Just a picture of our favorite sibling characters, platonic) I agreed. I don't know what I was thinking, I should've known it'd upset my now ex. When he told me about it, I thought of it, and decided to change it (not to match anymore). My friend changed it to one picture I drew of him once which upset my ex a lot, they ended up not talking anymore.

Which I think was one of the things that got him mad, he got really mad at me and ended up saying everything he really thought about my lies and about the things I did. I did not know what to say and anytime  did, I felt like I made everything worse. He's considering leaving. I don't wanna let him go. He's still such huge part of my life, and I still love him. But if he'll wanna leave, it's completely fair. 

There are some things I did not like that he did, and also hurt me in a fucked up way. But I don't feel like it's very valid for me to mention it, since what I did is such shit thing to do. In fact, I cried many nights, and I was so embarrassed of myself, so ashamed, I feel like it's not valid for me to be the one hurt, I hurt everyone around me with such horrible lie.

I still love him so much, and I do gotta admit, our relationship wasn't very healthy. But it hurts to see him actually consider leave. I would work on it for years to make it healthy, or to make him feel better. But it was visibly making him feel even worse. It was like a reality check when he said all the things he said. They hurt me a lot, but I think it was necessary for them to hurt so I would finally understand. I cannot stop drowning in quilt for like 6 months now and it's horrible. What's even worse is I cannot take anything I did back, even though I wish I did. I wish I never hurt him. I wish I never lied about who I am. And I wish I was at least a bit better. I feel like the worst partner ever.

Thanks to anyone who read it. I apologize if it seems like a shit confession, but I had to get it off my chest.

Edit : Hey, though of it again and I realized I left out some detail, so I'll say them now. I lied to the point when i photoshopped images to ""prove"" I am actually that person. And made stupid excused why i can't call(for example that my voice is weak.) Yes. This probably makes it even shittier but I just had ro say it.
My partner already had severe trust issues so this made everything ofc worse. Again, I feel really shitty about it but I had to mention this as well. Thank you."	198635y	i lied to my long distance partner and friends about who i am	"hey im sam around three years ago i met someone through the internet after a while i completely fell in love with him we even ended up dating but theres something ive been doing from the start ive been lying about who i am i sent fake pictures even fake voice messages for years to him and my friends i dont know how i was capable of doing it for so long mainly because of how close we all were it started to get to me eat me from the inside so i decided it would be great to tell them about who i really am and finally be honest there was a lot of tears from both sides but i did it i finally told them the truth and it felt really good my friend took it okay which im to this day surprised of and even my partner did which i was extremely happy for but was he really okay

it turns out he wasnt not at all it hurt him a lot and i hate the fact that i hurt him after all i made him fall in love with someone else he lost a huge amount of trust for me which i admit is valid i tried to make it better somehow but i knew the mental scar will always be there for both of us after a while it even started to look okay i was being all honest and no more lies but it was still bothering him a lot he ended up losing his feelings for me partially and breaking up with me but said itd be cool to still stay friends

my now ex partner was still someone i loved though i could not move on so quickly and i still didnt his trust for me began to disappear as well to the point he thought i was cheating on him with my friend i think its fair to state i used to be in a romantic relationship with that friend but it barely lasted a year i do not feel any romantic attraction to him right now i consider him as my family and he has a girlfriend and my partner knew him well and knew we used to date thats why i thought itd be okay my partner was worried about me cheating on him many times i always reassured him i never cheated on him and never had anyone in my mind other than him 

another thing me and my now ex used to match profile pictures on basically every platform we used which of course had to go after we broke up like a month after the break up my friend he was worried about asked me if id like to match just a picture of our favorite sibling characters platonic i agreed i dont know what i was thinking i shouldve known itd upset my now ex when he told me about it i thought of it and decided to change it not to match anymore my friend changed it to one picture i drew of him once which upset my ex a lot they ended up not talking anymore

which i think was one of the things that got him mad he got really mad at me and ended up saying everything he really thought about my lies and about the things i did i did not know what to say and anytime  did i felt like i made everything worse hes considering leaving i dont wanna let him go hes still such huge part of my life and i still love him but if hell wanna leave its completely fair 

there are some things i did not like that he did and also hurt me in a fucked up way but i dont feel like its very valid for me to mention it since what i did is such shit thing to do in fact i cried many nights and i was so embarrassed of myself so ashamed i feel like its not valid for me to be the one hurt i hurt everyone around me with such horrible lie

i still love him so much and i do gotta admit our relationship wasnt very healthy but it hurts to see him actually consider leave i would work on it for years to make it healthy or to make him feel better but it was visibly making him feel even worse it was like a reality check when he said all the things he said they hurt me a lot but i think it was necessary for them to hurt so i would finally understand i cannot stop drowning in quilt for like  months now and its horrible whats even worse is i cannot take anything i did back even though i wish i did i wish i never hurt him i wish i never lied about who i am and i wish i was at least a bit better i feel like the worst partner ever

thanks to anyone who read it i apologize if it seems like a shit confession but i had to get it off my chest

edit  hey though of it again and i realized i left out some detail so ill say them now i lied to the point when i photoshopped images to prove i am actually that person and made stupid excused why i cant callfor example that my voice is weak yes this probably makes it even shittier but i just had ro say it
my partner already had severe trust issues so this made everything ofc worse again i feel really shitty about it but i had to mention this as well thank you"	y
518	Recently realized I'm a manipulator and a liar....	"Lost my relationship last September. ( Was 2nd relationship of my 21 years of life )
After breakup i realized I might have been manipulating my ex.
I used to tell her that I'm very lucky to have her ( I really meant it ), she can get anyone in her life, am I really capable of making you happy? ( Deep down in my heart I knew yes I can make her happy ) but why did I still say that thing? Don't cheat on me please, you will never leave me right? ( I knew she will never do such thing ), I lied to her for the first time ( I used to say I hate liars which I really do ) and I got caught ( I'm dumb I can't lie ) and then I thought again why did I say all those things? Why did lie? and then atlast I was just blaming my previous relationship for my insecurities and manipulative behaviour. 

I never got a chance to apologize and now I'm disgusted of myself. I ruined her first time being in a relationship, I became exactly what she hated the most. I will never forgive myself for what I did."	197q29r	recently realized im a manipulator and a liar	"lost my relationship last september  was nd relationship of my  years of life

519	I used to lie about my ethnicity to my classmates for cool points	"Im 100% European, mostly Northwestern (so basically a common white American), but my moms side of the family happens to be olive skinned with dark hair. We all tan real easy and my mom would regularly get mistaken for a hispanic woman. Not sure what happened there but because of this I would sometimes get asked what my background or ethnicity was and I got tired of just saying white so I would lie and make up something like ""Egyptian"" or ""Brazilian"" or something that would make me seem exotic. After years of doing that I found out that I had to stop because those people I would meet would become friends who wanted to come over and meet my parents and wouldnt they be shocked to find out both of my parents are English speaking Americans after i told them a whole different story. It never came back to bite me but I still cringe when I think of it. Wat a weird thing to lie about right lol"	197ma07	i used to lie about my ethnicity to my classmates for cool points	im  european mostly northwestern so basically a common white american but my moms side of the family happens to be olive skinned with dark hair we all tan real easy and my mom would regularly get mistaken for a hispanic woman not sure what happened there but because of this i would sometimes get asked what my background or ethnicity was and i got tired of just saying white so i would lie and make up something like egyptian or brazilian or something that would make me seem exotic after years of doing that i found out that i had to stop because those people i would meet would become friends who wanted to come over and meet my parents and wouldnt they be shocked to find out both of my parents are english speaking americans after i told them a whole different story it never came back to bite me but i still cringe when i think of it wat a weird thing to lie about right lol	ma
520	I lower the tv when my dad and step mom aren’t looking and now they are arguing	"Hi, I am sorry. I just turned 17. :(
My dad cheated on my mom and married this lady named Stella. This all happened in such a short amount of time. I am overwhelmed. 
Stella is awful. I’m sorry. 
She’s nice-ish, but I hate having to live with her. I also have to help take care of her, she has diabetes and other health issues and I feel like these expectations are demanded of me so quickly. 

I am so overwhelmed all the time because she is overwhelmingly loud. She slams cabinet doors, and drawers and doors. She talks loudly. She blasts music loudly. She does everything loudly. It makes me cry sometimes. I just want to come home from school and enjoy the quiet to relax and I can’t. My dad doesn’t give a fuck he just lets her? I feel like how I live my life has changed so much in such a short amount of time. 

To combat this, when they aren’t looking I lower the tv. 
They get upset and get into arguments and accuse each other of changing the volume or argue about whether they should get a new tv. 

I just want my mom to be honest.

521	I lied to everyone for 1 year about how much money I have	"this is an throwaway account, probably won’t be responding.

About 1,5 years ago I wanted to invest my money. So I did the only thing reasonable and learned anything I could about investing. I even made a demo account with fake money to see if I was right in my predictions, but more on that later. At the time I actually was really interested in investing and I I had fun researching ways on how I could make my money grow. Fast forward 1/2 a year and investing was the only thing I talked about. I now understand why my friends got annoyed with it and started to ask how much I actually made investing. I told them I didn’t make anything right now and I was planning to open a real portfolio with my savings in it soon.

Now I am genuinely a calm guy who doesn’t get pissed off easily but when I hear the same question every 1/2 hour for 8 hours straight for two weeks I will loose it. I also noticed it became kind of a joke and people would ask me how much I made from investing just to drive me insane. At least that’s how it felt. One day I decided to buy an option on the demo account and just to keep it  really short: options are high risk high return bets on a stocks price on a certain point in time. Since it was a demo account I said fuck it and bought 2k of my 12k portfolio on an Amazon call exp. in 1 week something I would never do with real life money. I can’t stress enough how much of a gamble this was. Somehow this gamble payed out and my entire portfolio was now worth 23k in fake money.
Honestly I felt really good although i knew it was all sheer luck and it didn’t affect me really.

The next day after I closed my position one of my close friends comes up to me and asks if i would ever invest any money. I still felt really entitled from yesterday and thought what would happen if I lied and said this fake demo account was real and I made 11k overnight. I guess I let myself go told him exactly that. He then asked me to show him and I opened my account and his jaw dropped seeing my return. He congratulated me and showed a lot of other friends who were close by. When asked what I would do with all that money I said I would reinvest into something safer and not spend it, just so no one would get ideas and ask me for money. 

At the time it felt good, really good. A lot of people started talking to me and everybody seemed really nice. Looking back now I feel terrible. This lie has been on me the day I told it and it has been going on for a year now without anyone noticing. Yes, there were some close calls however nothing big to raise suspicion.

I feel bad, and I lost the joy of learning ever since. Everything became boring. I feel like I cheated, on everybody. This was the first and hopefully the only time I will ever have to say I am richer that I am. I am a fraud and can’t trust myself anymore, but with what, I barely do anything these days. I lay most of my free time in bed watching nonsense. I never even invested a single penny…

If you got this far thank you. I just felt like I had to get this out. Maybe I can finally change now.."	196t6ni	i lied to everyone for  year about how much money i have	"this is an throwaway account probably wont be responding

522	The time I was desperate to pay rent and stole from work	"Statute of limitations on this one is up so I feel safe confessing it. Still going to be vague enough that it could be anyone and anywhere though. 

At the time I was living with an emotionally abusive ex who often refused to work. We had rent of $1500 a month (was supposed to be $1200 but they hit us with a lot of fees we weren't told about before signing the lease, too ignorant at the time to know what to do so we suffered for a year). We were constantly just barely paying rent on time. Constantly having to borrow and payback family. I had to ask people to pay me back money I had forgotten about for over a year because I was desperate.
We were barely able to eat which was compounded by my ex randomly deciding he didn't ""deserve"" to eat and refusing to eat the food I bought for him until it went bad. He would only eat if I cooked is the real reason. And if I cooked and saved leftovers for myself he would eat those because ""I wasn't"" so I also had to budget one fast food meal in for me when at work because sometimes I wasn't able to eat at home due to this. 
I was already stealing food at Walmart, the dollar store and the grocery store. Sometimes being as bold as to put it in my purse when I knew there were no cameras and other times just using mt purse to hide it and giving plausible deniabiliry I forgot about it if its pointed out (which meant buying it to avoid suspicion and cutting further into the budget)

It was at such a dire state I usually withdrew my paychecks in cash and set aside the rent money and would obsessively count and recount it daily to see how much more we needed on my next check and doing what I could to try to take overtime and make more than that so we could eat too.

So one month we were desperate. Our rental company wouldn't accept anything less than the 100% full payment or they'd reject your money order. 
We were $40 short. No one could lend us. We wouldn't get paid again for two weeks which is too late. Every day we were late would also be $50 fine on top of the rent so if we would be able to get money Friday we would need like $50xhow many days until then + the $40
So
One day in an absolute panick I stole $40 from our tip jar at work. I have no idea how I wasn't caught as I did it in front of the camera. It was near the holidays and people were tipping us well so it just took secretly pocketing two $20s.
But that $40 would've been split for the whole store so it was a greedy if desperate thing to do.

But it got us through that month. Once our lease was up we were able to move somewhere cheaper and I felt brave enough to dump my loser ex. 
I'm in a better situation now and havent stolen anything at all since then. 

I only got caught once during this period and they let me go with a warning once I paid for the item. 

But I could've thrown my whole life away for a desperate moment.

523	I hit a car and got away easily....................	"Hey folks, this is my throwaway account, and I want to confess to an incident that happened to me a few days back. It was my exam, which didn't go well. The exam was early, around 9 am in the morning. After the exam, I came home and slept for almost 5 hours. When I woke up, one of my friends told me that he had some ""w,"" and I went to his place. We smoked some ""w,"" and on my way, for a second, I lost my sight and crashed into a car. The speed wasn't that high, but it affected the other car badly. The boot lid collapsed, and the lights and glass shattered. Everyone was in shock. One guy came over to my car, and I just accelerated and ran over him. He might got hurt, but I still ran away. The time was almost 11 PM, so no one could read the number plate. The next day, before any of my family members woke up, I got my car fixed. It wasn't that bad, but I really feel sorry for that guy. I don't remember the car, but it was an expensive one. If I hadn't had any ""w,"" I could have stopped myself, but the laws in my country are very strict, and I could have ended up getting jailed for almost 10 years with that stuff.
What do you guys think for the sake of my career and family I did that thing right or wrong coz this incident is coming in my mind again and again and can't get over it.

524	Crashed my sisters brand new motorbike when I was 16	"When I was 16 my sister bought a brand new 125cc scooter. She let me have a go as we live down a country lane. I was speeding, turned a corner and I saw a man walking his dog and panicked. 
The motorbike went on to the grass verge and I crashed it. The front wheel was out of alignment, which I straightened back. And they was mud and grass all over one side. 
I managed to clean this off before returning back home. With only minor scratches.

525	Crashed my new one month car and told no one what happened	"a couple years back i was working a night shift job

BACKSTORY
we’d clean stores typically 3 or 4 depending how bad they are. sometimes they were in town others close to two hours away . i typically liked waking up early for school , started at 8 but would be awake around 5 . anyways not important . i’d get home around 4:30ish and that night we had a job that was two hours away . go to work we do everything and now it’s time to head back . we’d all carpool and go from there . we get back to my friends house and i’m literally exhausted and drained. have been awake since 5am went to school then worked and it’s now around 5or 6am next day we arrive and now it’s only a matter of me heading home which is about 15 minutes away . 

Omw home i’m literally dazing off . nothing is keeping me awake. i even have vague memories of passing 1 or 2 stop signs and red lights . i’m less than 5 minutes from my house. i doze off so bad i lose control of the car which made me run over a stop sign which woke the hell out of me , and then run into a mailbox and later into a street light . the entire front car was damaged. i park the car and get out and panicking not knowing what to do . the mailbox stand is all bend and the physical mailbox is halfway across the street . ABSOLUTELY NO ONE WAS AROUND OR CAME OUT!!!!!! and this happen on a kinda busy road!!  i go pick it up and just leave at there door step . I never called the cops or filed insurance . i fixed the car out of pocket sadly . that day lives with me forever because i pass by that road every single day . 
everything eventually got fixed i guess the city fixed it or something . idk how i didn’t get caught . when i parked i parked at a gas station so the cameras had to have gotten my plates im guessing . i remember it even came out on the local news and newspaper what happened asking people in our town  that if they knew anything to call the city . i was scared for weeks . i never got caught with anything just continued living my ordinary life . 

To anyone who works night shift , always be super careful heading home . If you literally can’t stay awake just call someone or park somewhere safe and take a nap . don’t be dumb like me"	193y4dj	crashed my new one month car and told no one what happened	"a couple years back i was working a night shift job

526	I stole the donations made to our company and I don't know if I should keep it or not	"My mom died a year ago from breast cancer and my dad basically left me to care for my younger siblings. I live paycheck to paycheck and my credit card bank already hired a collections agency to call me everyday. I'm still in a huge debt due to my mom's cancer treatments for two years. I'm a few hundred dollars lacking for our rent but I seriously only have around 20 dollars in my name. I'm desperate and don't know what to do, we don't have any relatives or friends that could help us.

Recently, our company hosted a donation drive for Christmas and I received around 200 dollars (enough to get me and my siblings through). I have it with me right now but I'm still debating if I should use it or not. The company won't be able to track it because these were all given to me anonymously in cash but I still feel bad. I know it would help my family so much but I can't stomach thinking that if my mom could see me right now doing what I'm doing, she'd be disgusted of me.

Edit: each employee is responsible of collecting the donations and I was able to collect the 200 dollars. The donation drive was not connected to my current living situation but for christmas.

&#x200B;

Update: Thank you, everyone for talking me out of it. I haven't been myself these past few days but I'll do my best  to hang on for my little family. I'll turn the donations in first thing tomorrow and try to talk to my landlord. You were all so kind to a stranger. I never knew how much I needed it until now.

530	i’m failing school but everyone thinks i’m going to graduate	"tw

i’m in my senior year of high school and i’m supposed to be an early graduate. after nearly failing my sophomore year, i promised myself that i would make the absolute best effort i could in order to pass. i was prone to skipping school days and not doing my work, which almost led me to getting held back. i’m my junior year, i did well enough to apply for early graduates. everyone i’ve told was so proud of me and all believed i was going to do great 

but 

recently, i’ve fallen back into my old habits. for about a month, i’ve been doing terrible in school. i’ve been skipping, i haven’t been doing my work, and my grades have tanked massively. this semester is the last semester i need to take. three of my four classes are the only ones i need left before i can graduate. i’m failing all of them. and i have way to many absences 

frankly, i have no idea what to do. i’m about a week or two, the semester ends. that’s not nearly enough for me to get back on track. i am likely not going to walk at the early graduation and will have to retake the classes the next semester. i don’t know how people will react

everyone is under the impression that i’m doing good in school. everyone thinks i’m going to graduate early. especially my mom 

when she finds out, she’s going to be so disappointed in me. and i believe everyone else will too. people will ridicule me

i don’t want to be a failure, but i set myself up for that by falling into old habits. i wholeheartedly believe that, because of this, i will make it nowhere in life. sure, i might get a chance to retake the classes during the second semester or during summer school. but what if i don’t? i’d have to repeat the whole year. and that will not look good on college applications or future resumes

i have literally set myself up for failure when all my family and friends think i’m destined for greatness

what makes matters worse is that my family is relying on my early graduation. everything feels like it rests on my shoulders. i was supposed to get a job during the second semester before going to college. i was supposed to get a good job after college. but it seems my chances of that are practically over 

i have contemplated suicide because of this (along with other personal matters but that’s not what this post is about). if i don’t pass school then i will never be anything good in my life

i can think of no solutions for my situation. i have heard of people dropping out and getting their ged, but i don’t know the process of doing that and if it even helps in the long run"	1929cc6	im failing school but everyone thinks im going to graduate	"tw

531	i made a KFC worker clean my poo and its been on my mind for months	"I (21m) live in a small southern Missourian town an hour south of St. Louis. Its a small town where you go to surrounding small towns to run errands. Me and my girlfriend (22f) were heading home from a grocery store 2 towns over. On the way back i felt the unsettling chirp from the devil himself through my butthole. I got off the highway, and went to a gas station to get gas and poop. we went in paid for gas and i tried to poop but someone was in the bathroom. Went outside and pumped gas and afterwards i went back inside but the bathroom was still locked. At this moment it was do or die, it felt like holding it in was an olympic sport. There was a KFC right next to this gas station so i go drive my car there and park. Immediately i run inside leaving the car running with my girlfriend inside. I run towards the bathroom and the stall was out of order and in this moment i had to make a decision to A) poo my pants or B) poop in the broken toilet. I went back to my car with clean pants and my girlfriend noticed i looked disgruntled. she asked me what was wrong and i said ""i just pooped in a toilet that was out of order and now some kfc employee is gonna have to clean my poo out of a toilet"" i almost started crying.

533	I broke a bullies head and lied about it and never got any repercussion when I was 6	"Ill keep this short

Basically the entirety of neighborhood kids pulled up to my house to play in the garden, but we purposefully made sure we didnt invite this one bully who annoyed everybody, kid comes to the door with FOMO and starts ringing the door bell so much so my mom came outside angry to see who was doing that I explained and told her ill deal with it. 
I grabbed a heavy metallic sphere thingy and threw it into the air so it went over the wall surrounding the house. 
It lands and the next sound we all heard was a AHHHHHHHH.
Calm and peace washes over us as the bully isn’t bothering us and nothing comes of it. 

Next day a lady was walking in the neighborhood and she asked me if i knew the kid because his head was broken and she wanted to know what had happened, i simply denied knowing anything of it. I never told a soul about it. 
End of story 
I could’ve gone in detail but idk if y’all’s ADHD would follow through with the story

534	I kept a $100 gift card I found even after the owner asked me if I had seen it.	"Back in December I was shopping at my local Walmart when I slipped on a card. I picked it up and noticed it was a target card. I was going to throw it away but decided to check the balance and realized it had $100 on it. I without thinking clicked to add the balance to my target account. 

I realized what I did immediately and I honestly didn't feel bad. Who ever dropped it likely didn't realize it was missing and I could use the money. I viewed it as a gift from the other side. That was until I noticed a young man and his kid walking around asking people if they had seen a gift card. I just said no and continued shopping.

I bought some food and laundry soap. Food that proves to be helpful as I was struggling to afford food and bills. Without that money I wouldn't have had food. I was planning on just not having anything as I was just too broke. I needed to make 2 weeks of food with enough money to buy less than one.


Edit


Because some of the comments I've received I want to clarify that I'm not justifying what I did. I'm confessing to wrong doing. There's no excuse for me to continue to be the way I am. Thanks to this harsh wake up call I think I'm going to be talking to my therapist about it. I think I have more wrong than I originally thought. I legitimately want to be a good person but it seems that if I'm slightly challenged I'll just do anything no matter what to get back ahead. I've just started to realize this as I'm reading the harsh comments. I deserve it.

535	I used to trick a man into sending me Psn cards when I was a teen.	"When I was 14 my dad got me a ps3, but I had no games to play. So I used to spend a lot of my time playing a free BETA game online called PlayStation Home. It’s basically kinda like the game Sims, but online. Everything is virtual but you pay real money to buy virtual things like clothes, special customizations, house, apartment, etc. You can also interact with people all over the world in public virtual areas. When you type a little bubble appears above your avatar’s head in which anyone can see nearby. 

Anyway I was using a girl avatar to troll and I met this Arabic man who was in his 30s who claimed to be rich. At first he was teaching me Arabic language. Then it escalated to this weird Dom /Sub kink that he had. I had no idea what any of that meant when I was a teen but he wanted me to call him master and make my avatar do certain gestures and in return he would buy me Psn Cards, usually $50 cards. They are like gift cards which you redeem the code and can buy things for PlayStation so he basically just sent me the code. Sometimes he would tell me how to spend the Psn cards, like what outfits to buy for my avatar which were usually skimpy outfits. I did everything he asked I was just excited to download digital games from the Psn cards that he would give me. I did however spent most of his money on PlayStation Home content. This went on for a long time. Eventually I stopped spending so much time in that virtual world as I got older and wanted real life experiences. I eventually stopped signing online in PlayStation. But I found out years after that PlayStation Home closed way back in 2015, and it’s crazy thinking about it because thousands of users were active and spent a lot of time and money on that game which they can’t play anymore. I regret what I did to get Psn cards, even though it was all just in that virtual game."	191sq6g	i used to trick a man into sending me psn cards when i was a teen	"when i was  my dad got me a ps but i had no games to play so i used to spend a lot of my time playing a free beta game online called playstation home its basically kinda like the game sims but online everything is virtual but you pay real money to buy virtual things like clothes special customizations house apartment etc you can also interact with people all over the world in public virtual areas when you type a little bubble appears above your avatars head in which anyone can see nearby

536	I’m a horrible person with how I handled a mental health episode	"I’m 32 now.

Got diagnosed bipolar at 18 when I was involuntarily committed. My first visit with a therapist landed me in a hospital. Made me refuse to get help for years. Coped with drugs and was a heroin user for a short period.

Moved abroad and had my fist episode with psychosis at 22. I lost a job and had no support or means around me.

I found comfort and help in strangers

Got into the habit of sleeping with married women older than me. Sometimes by a decent amount.

Even allowed myself to be seen after negotiating and agreeing to such things as long as they booked the hotel and paid for everything I could visit 

Feel like I objectified myself and had no morals for the respect of what marriage meant.

Became so routine. Being called to be seen whenever these people wanted me

So I find it rather hard to live with myself knowing I slept with so many married people and what that says about me.

And I don’t understand what role I served these women before."	1913mri	im a horrible person with how i handled a mental health episode	"im  now

Back in our old place, my siblings and I started taking quarters and minuscule amounts of money from our parents, and after a while, that evolved into more money, like 10 or 20 dollars.

Wanna hear something funny?

My brother would blackmail my sister and I to continue to steal, threatening to tell our parents if we didn’t.

It was every few weekends for no more than 5 years, so I’m sure it never totaled to more than 1000$.

I have never told anyone about this. I needed to let this go. I have promised myself that I will pay my parents for it later in life, of course, they have no idea what we’d done (I think). My brother never apologized for it. He just acts like a dick still. I hate him.

545	I’ve been smoking crack on and off for a few weeks.	"I was a cocaine addict for a few years a while back. Regular cocaine, that is. Then I was an opioid addict for a few years too. I recently had 18 months clean. After going through a break up I was in a poor state of mind and decided to reunite with my old “friend/coke dealer.” Him and I had been through thick and thin, in debt to the dealer, in private sections of the clubs, kicked out of our parents houses, moving in our girlfriends to the drug spot, hooked on heroin together, withdrawal together, you get the picture. There’s a lot of history there. 

But anyways, I arrive at his house to buy some coke. “Come in it’s openn!” He yells from the living room. As I walk in he’s heating some mixture in a spoon with a torch lighter at the bottom. I ask if he’s shooting heroin or something, to which he responds that he’s cooking crack. “It’s better than coke bro. It’s stronger bro, it doesn’t hurt your nose anyways. I don’t even do powder anymore I cook it up.” 

So of course my dumbass takes a hit. Now I’m walking around 2 weeks later with a kit for cooking in my bag, hoping that I’ll be able to waste my money getting more. I’m at outpatient treatment right now but just can’t seem to shake the urge.

I wanted to be cool and edgy to try and get attention and be popular so I showed my friends a horrible and disgusting gore video and one of them almost snitched. it still haunts me to this day remembering what I saw and the gutt reneging  feeling it gave me and it is always in the back of my mind reminding me of what I did and there’s still a possibility that I could get in a ton of trouble if he remembers because we are still friends and he I think but I’m not sureforgot.	18wzr41	a couple years ago i showed my friends a horrible video that i still regret	i have been torn up recently about this more than usual and i wanted to get this off my chest a couple years ago i really wanted attention from others at school this kid told about a video i wanted to be cool and edgy to try and get attention and be popular so i showed my friends a horrible and disgusting gore video and one of them almost snitched it still haunts me to this day remembering what i saw and the gutt reneging  feeling it gave me and it is always in the back of my mind reminding me of what i did and theres still a possibility that i could get in a ton of trouble if he remembers because we are still friends and he i think but im not sureforgot	wzr
547	When I was a kid I tried to steal my friends bracelet	When I was around 11 years old one of my younger friends who was around 8 or 9 came to my house for a sleepover. She had this beautiful turquoise bracelet that I instantly fell in love with. I asked her if I could trade it for one of my toys but she said no. I offered her other things I had and practically BEGGED her. She still said no, because her grandma had given it to her. The morning, while she was in the bathroom I grabbed the bracelet from her stuff and hid it in between my bed and my nightstand. I planned to steal it because I wanted it SO bad. A few hours later when her mom came to pick her up she went to grab her things and began frantically looking for it. My guilt kicked in so I started helping her “look” for it and then magically found it in my hiding spot. I told her it must have fallen off my nightstand in between the bed and she never thought anything of it. To this day I still am so glad I gave it back because she ended up moving away, I never saw her again after that which meant I never would’ve had the chance to give it back.	18whsjt	when i was a kid i tried to steal my friends bracelet	when i was around  years old one of my younger friends who was around  or  came to my house for a sleepover she had this beautiful turquoise bracelet that i instantly fell in love with i asked her if i could trade it for one of my toys but she said no i offered her other things i had and practically begged her she still said no because her grandma had given it to her the morning while she was in the bathroom i grabbed the bracelet from her stuff and hid it in between my bed and my nightstand i planned to steal it because i wanted it so bad a few hours later when her mom came to pick her up she went to grab her things and began frantically looking for it my guilt kicked in so i started helping her look for it and then magically found it in my hiding spot i told her it must have fallen off my nightstand in between the bed and she never thought anything of it to this day i still am so glad i gave it back because she ended up moving away i never saw her again after that which meant i never wouldve had the chance to give it back	whsjt
548	I (19) once insulted a kid with ADHD when I was in high school	"For context, this kid with ADHD was a complete asshole to many people, me included. He was racist, ableist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, and almost anything else under the sun. He was so mean and collected all the infinity stones for types of discrimination against people.

I myself am autistic and he has made demeaning comments about the disorder, including discrimination against me. During drama class, he once even said,

""This is drama class, not special ed class.""

I once later got him back, but I don't feel that bad about it for some reason. I once told him,

""At least I don't need pills to function.""

549	I messed up my own life by dropping out of high school	"I wish I could restart and do things correctly.

My 17 year old self didn't understand that high school has an age limit

I'm not even sure if this is the right place for this. 
I know no one cares. Thats part of the reason why I failed. There was very little encouragement at home. 

But if I'm being honest... I just gave up because the assignments were too difficult for me. I was a loner in school. 

I'm not sure what I want people to tell me. Just be glad you're not me I guess.

550	Borrowed a truck to get car out of ditch during snow storm I returned the truck after I was done with it.	Some 50 years ago back as a crazy teenager that I was. A buddy and I were out one night on a snowy evening. We were going down a winding road and my car slipped into a ditch. Just so happened it was close to where there was some heavy machinery. Went to see what we could use to pull a car out of a ditch and found a truck. Keys were in it and after some efforts and smart maneuvering we were able to get my car out of the ditch. Truck returned no harm no foul... right? 	18ul6lb	borrowed a truck to get car out of ditch during snow storm i returned the truck after i was done with it	some  years ago back as a crazy teenager that i was a buddy and i were out one night on a snowy evening we were going down a winding road and my car slipped into a ditch just so happened it was close to where there was some heavy machinery went to see what we could use to pull a car out of a ditch and found a truck keys were in it and after some efforts and smart maneuvering we were able to get my car out of the ditch truck returned no harm no foul right 	ullb
551	I broke my leg at work trying to throw up in the grass instead of on the sidewalk.	"So, I work in the ER. I had been feeling pretty nauseous that morning on my way to work, but had no other symptoms so I just figured it was just from reflux or something. I have a horrible time with it sometimes. 

When I got there, it was pouring rain. I was walking in and then it hit me. I’m going to puke. I didn’t want to throw up on the sidewalk because that would be super embarrassing, so I ran to the grass. 

I stepped on the grass and felt my leg snap. And that’s all I remember because then I passed out lol. My coworker who was also coming in was like what are you doing? Are you ok? 

I was like I think I threw up on myself. If I even threw up. I might not have gotten that far. I think I hurt my ankle. So more of my coworkers came out to put me in a wheelchair. And I had to explain how this happened to the attending, who is also my coworker. 

I broke my tibia, fibula, dislocated my ankle, and ruptured a ligament. Because I didn’t want to be embarrassed by vomiting on the sidewalk. I tell all my friends and fam I just slipped in the rain though. 

Best believe though, next time I’ll just puke on the sidewalk. 

Oh, and, I never did throw up.

552	I threw a girl’s belongings in the trash when I was younger	This happened all the way back in my 3rd year of elementary school. I had a crush on this guy and we were somewhat good friends. One of my girlfriends befriended the same guy and they became super good friends. They would talk ALL THE TIME and ultimately I grew jealous thinking she was trying to steal him from me. My last straw was when I saw them exchanging gifts. After this, I started stealing her belongings (her family travelled quite often so she had a lot of keychains from different countries and some sentimental things as well) from her school bag and either throwing them in the trash or taking them home as an act of “revenge”. A few days later, my mom saw a keychain of hers in my bag which was of a country we had never visited. I told her I must’ve accidentally put it in my bag and promised to return it to her and threw it in the trash the next day. I never apologised to her and she never found out that I was behind all of this, but I still feel terrible thinking about it.	18u05ec	i threw a girls belongings in the trash when i was younger	this happened all the way back in my rd year of elementary school i had a crush on this guy and we were somewhat good friends one of my girlfriends befriended the same guy and they became super good friends they would talk all the time and ultimately i grew jealous thinking she was trying to steal him from me my last straw was when i saw them exchanging gifts after this i started stealing her belongings her family travelled quite often so she had a lot of keychains from different countries and some sentimental things as well from her school bag and either throwing them in the trash or taking them home as an act of revenge a few days later my mom saw a keychain of hers in my bag which was of a country we had never visited i told her i mustve accidentally put it in my bag and promised to return it to her and threw it in the trash the next day i never apologised to her and she never found out that i was behind all of this but i still feel terrible thinking about it	uec
553	I might have started a very large rat infestation in my neighborhood	"For context, a few months ago, me and my dad went to visit my grandma who lives on the other side of the city. While I was snooping around my grandma's storage room, I saw these rainboots and for whatever reason I decided to ask my grandma if I could have them. Now when I got the boots nothing seemed off, I thought they looked quite normal and clean looking on the outside so I didnt bother trying them on.

When we got home, that's when I found out how wrong I was. Thank god I didn't put the boots on. My dad did... He felt something squishy and disgusting on his feet so he dumped the contents of the boots and then we saw. There were baby rats ***(mice? sorry english isn't my first language)*** inside each boot. Im not talking like 2-3 baby rats. There were ALOT. Maybe like 40-50 in total? They looked like they had just been born. It was so horrifying and nasty. Some freaking rat had turned it into a nest of sorts.

My dad immidiately thought about killing the rats and getting rid of them but I coudn't do it. No matter how disgusting they were I still felt bad for them their mother was probaly frantically looking for them but my dad insisted. Of course I did not listen and I decided to dump the mice on the shallow part of neighborhood's canal system hoping they would survive. I told my dad I had dumped them into the canal to drown them but I lied.

Now I forgot about this entire incident and I have even worn the boots on several occasions but recently, I noticed a few rats scurrying around the neghborhood. These rats we huge!! Not new york city levels but still pretty huge. They were as big as kittens. I thought nothing of it but then I heard several neighbors complaining how there were rats inside their homes and that's when I connected the dots and realized those rats might have been the same ones I dumped a month ago.

And thats pretty much it. I live in a nicer area so our neighborhood was pretty clean up until those rats started scurrying around the streets. In the garbage and in people's houses. Even our house was no exception, my mom screamed in the early hours of the morning and that's when I knew they had invaded our house as well. People were getting mad and complaining and I am horrified. The local government unit has already become involved and I think this is becoming a very big issue...

THE RATS ARE EVERYWHERE NOW. I seem to be the only one who has realized as my dad seems to be oblivious and I plan to keep it that way. I know it might sound like nothing to you all but everytime I hear a scream in our neighborhood I do feel a little bad. I seem to have made things just a little harder for everyone living here.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Im sorry I may have given the impression I was a disgusting person for keeping the boots. I grew up in a household where the furniture would be rearranged every sunday just to make sure every spot would be clean. Back then I just thought it was such a waste to throw them away when they were still usable. I did deep clean them. I used a shit ton of cleaning agents to make sure those boots were not nasty anymore before I even put them on my feet.

554	I haven't been taking my meds for months on purpose and now I might need surgery.	"I have a condition called Graves and it's slowly been destroying my life. I can't do the things I used to. I've been living in constant pain, but I also struggle with a rampant ED, I'm huge, overweight and struggling with restriction and emission. My doctors don't believe me though. I've been told I need to exercise and diet so I can return to a healthier weight because I have liver disfunction due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. I have a gym membership. The last time I went to the gym I collapsed on the treadmill with a HR of 210bpm and had to be carried out by my partner. I'm 245lbs, no matter what I do I cannot lose weight and I can't figure out why. I have Graves, Gastroparesis, nafld, POTs, hyper mobility in almost every joint, IBS and EOE. Eating anything makes me miserable. 

My doctor told me that one of the major symptoms of Graves is rapid weight loss. In the beginning before they knew I had Graves I had gone from 270 to 215. I was extatic. Then I started taking my meds and started ballooning up again. So I stopped. I was on a weight loss drug and it really helped silence the food talk in my head and I was able to eat and was happy but then my insurance denied a refill because they don't cover weight loss meds. I don't know what to do. I can't look at my meds and now even when I take them I involuntarily throw them up. 

My endocrinologist told me I might need to have my thyroid removed because my levels are so dangerous they're doing damage to my heart. But if I have my thyroid removed I'll have hypothyroidism and I'll get even fatter. Idk what to do. I'm so scared. It took 2 years to get a Gastroparesis diagnosis because I was fat. I didn't get a Graves diagnosis until I collapsed at work and the hospital doctor ran tests and caught it. My primary care doctor told me she didn't want to run tests for hyperthyroidism because I was fat and being skinny is a symptom of it. I have so much wrong with me. I live in constant pain, can hardly eat even when I want to, am constantly vomiting even when I don't want to and I'm scared that if I don't lose weight I'm going to die from some condition they never thought to check for because I'm fat.

556	I laughed at the pain and suffering of a woman with cancer.	"I'm not 100% sure this fits here, but I'll explain anyway. If it gets removed, so be it.

Almost two weeks ago, I was at my brother's birthday party. We had invited the next door neighbor, among others, to come, have some lunch, and celebrate. Neighbors friend was there visiting, so we invited him too. At one point, the neighbor, his friend, and I, were just sitting around bantering, laughing, and just joking around for the most part. At some point I got distracted with party duties, and stopped following the conversation, but didn't want to appear rude so I sort of half chuckled, when I thought neighbor, and friend were telling a joke.

Well, somewhere along the line, the conversation turned from jokes and good vibes to neighbor's friend mentioning his sick wife having just had an operation, and taking a turn for the worse. I didn't quite pick up on this change of mood until I laughed at what I thought was going to be the setup for a joke, which just turned out to be this guys wife being in agony. Needless to say, I fucked up, and these guys left the party shortly after. I hoped to God that they didn't hear me, and this wouldn't affect good relations with them, but after seeing them on Christmas Eve, and meeting the wife in question, who, if looks could kill, would have ended me in a heartbeat. I can safely say that they definitely picked up on my laughter, and now I will forever be known as that asshole who laughed at the suffering of a woman battling cancer. I just hope that I haven't also caused problems for the rest of my family now.

Edit: for the people who suggest apologizing, I hope I get a chance to do so. Something I didn't mention earlier in my post is that I live interstate, and i'm only visiting family for birthday/Christmas/New Year's. Then heading back to my normal life in early January.

560	I have been lying to my parents for over two months.	"I am a 15 year old girl. I have been struggling with social anxiety for the last couple years. Recently, the social anxiety has taken control of my life, affecting not only myself but my family as well.  
About 2 months ago, I was having an especially hard day at weight training for my sport. I convinced my mom I was going to throw up. Conveniently, my older sister had just come home from school with a 24-48 hour stomach bug. I faked catching this as well, just thinking that everyone fakes being sick at some point. I could only think to myself, ""just one more day,"" after a couple days I learned to vomit on command. I knew I shouldn't do that, it can have serious long term effects. I can't stop now. My mom still thinks I am sick. I can't stand being full. I can't do it.  
Now my mom has been very worried about me, calling every pediatrician she knows. I have had countless uncomfortable tests since then, including blood draws, urine tests, breath tests, celiac test, and even an endoscopy (for anyone that doesn't know, that requires anesthesia.) I thought that's this would steer me away from continuing to pretend I have this illness. Now I have done hours of research abt the sickness to simulate that I have it. Im doing this all to avoid kids my own age.  
I feel like I have gaslit myself into having symptoms. Or it's from the drugs I take everyday that I don't need. I feel extremely tired and achy. My bones are tired. I am actually vomiting everyday. I hate vomiting but I can't stop. Im so sorry.  
Now I'm not going to pretend my family isn't well off, because we are. I feel like a privileged piece of shit with how much money my mom has spent trying to figure this out. I hate myself for it but I can't stop. I don't like how the drugs make me feel. I don't understand why Im doing this.

"My stepmother-in-law won't allow my father-in-law to eat anything with garlic or onions, not even garlic powder or onion powder. She claims that it hurts his stomach. So, whenever they're in town and come over for dinner, I refrain from using garlic or onions, which is frustrating because I use those two in just about everything I cook.   

For a little backstory about my step-MIL's cooking, she makes the blandest food. Once, we went to her Thanksgiving dinner. She cooked the turkey around noon, cut it up, and had it out around 3, but no one was allowed over until 5 pm. By the time we arrived, the turkey was cold AF and drier than the Sahara desert. The woman just doesn't know how to make a tasty meal.  

Anyhow, my FIL visited us once without his wife, and I made chicken breast with garlic and onion seasoning, and he loved it. Nothing happened to him after he ate it. He told me that he can eat garlic and onions if they're cooked. But for some reason, when he's around his wife, both of those ingredients are not to be used.  

They visited before Christmas, and we planned a dinner at my house. My sMIL made it a point to call me to remind me not to use garlic or onions. She also called my wife to remind me not to use garlic or onions. I was so annoyed that she made it a point to remind us not to use the two ingredients after years of her constantly reminding us. That night, I cooked the chicken breast with sage, rosemary, thyme, garlic, and onion powder. Both my sMIL and FIL loved the meal. In fact, they commented on how juicy the chicken was and how delicious it tasted. It turns out they both like garlic and onions but, for some reason, just have an issue with it. Also, neither one of them got sick."	18smrud	i used garlic and onions in a meal when i was strictly asked not to	"my stepmotherinlaw wont allow my fatherinlaw to eat anything with garlic or onions not even garlic powder or onion powder she claims that it hurts his stomach so whenever theyre in town and come over for dinner i refrain from using garlic or onions which is frustrating because i use those two in just about everything i cook

562	At work I was hiding in a corner because I was tired	Me and my coworker are the first people to get to work. Why I was tired, we have to be there before 6AM and I have to wake up at 5:25AM to get ready. Pretty early that I have to get up. When I got to work I couldn't focus on my work because I was tired. I also had lots of papers on my desk and they were unorganized. My coworkers desk sits right behind me, and my area and hers is separated by a wall. She was talking to 2 people in her area and I started going where I was out her view and she couldn't see me. First I stood by the wall and then I went to the corner and stood there. I didn't want her to see me not working. I had my arms tucked in my sleeves and I slowly started closing my eyes. My coworker stopped mid-conversation and came over to my area. She told me that those papers on my desk need to be organized and put away and there's work that needs to be done on my computer. And then she told me to stop hiding. She went back to the conversation she had with the 2 people.	18slbxi	at work i was hiding in a corner because i was tired	me and my coworker are the first people to get to work why i was tired we have to be there before am and i have to wake up at am to get ready pretty early that i have to get up when i got to work i couldnt focus on my work because i was tired i also had lots of papers on my desk and they were unorganized my coworkers desk sits right behind me and my area and hers is separated by a wall she was talking to  people in her area and i started going where i was out her view and she couldnt see me first i stood by the wall and then i went to the corner and stood there i didnt want her to see me not working i had my arms tucked in my sleeves and i slowly started closing my eyes my coworker stopped midconversation and came over to my area she told me that those papers on my desk need to be organized and put away and theres work that needs to be done on my computer and then she told me to stop hiding she went back to the conversation she had with the  people	slbxi

564	I cut a huge chunk off my hair and decided to blame someone else	"In year 1 or reception, I was dangerously holding a scissors next to my head and decided to open and close it cutting a chunk of my hair. I then saw it when pulling my hand to my face, and stared in disbelief and started to cry when a teacher noticed me.

 Me being too embarrassed and scared to get in trouble decided to blame it on another girl who was walking around the classroom and was coincidentally holding a scissors. That girl being my at the time friend got into so much trouble I couldnt look at her in the face. All her recess for about 3 days was gone (sounds less but any taken away recess can sound horrible so someone of that age) and I witnessed her mother shouting in rage at her while she cried her eyes out.

I never did confess. Mostly because it was almost 10 years ago and we lost contact when I left for secondary school I probably wouldnt have anyway. It was always in the back of my head though the way nobody believed her and she got punished.

565	I 16M regret visiting a brothel but struggle to hold myself from going back there	"I apologize if I misword any sentences since English isn't my first language and even if it was I'm not very good with words.

I'll begin with an introduction of myself. I'm currently 16 years old(turning 17 in spring) and going to my second year to last year of high school. I'm a fairly good student who gets good grades on subjects I study foreign but average to bad grades on the I don't study for. I don't have many friends and don't really like most of my other classmates since the only notable thing they do is smoke, distrupt class, and annoy me. I'm basically a class loser, no messages, barely going out with friends and the friend I do have aren't really good friends with me just barely.(they aren't bad it's just we aren't really close). Also, I get barely any attention from girls, no small talk,no dates, not even as friends, just nothing. I know most of these things are due to my cynical nature and bad personality, but that doesn't matter. I have a good family that did everything they could to give me a good childhood without me missing anything, and I'm grateful for that. I'm supposed to be Christian. I go to church with my family on Sundays and go to Sunday school every just I get. Even though I believe in God, that doesn't automatically make me a good moral person like the others around me because I'm weak and can't keep myself from falling.

So now let's get to what actually matters. Late June, I came across a website that listed escorts strip clubs and brothels in my city.(In my country, brothels can be legal and regulated, but most in the city are not, only a handfull). This website showed where these brothels are and reviews from their customers about their ""services."" I show that most of the illegal cheap brothels are nowhere near me in the city center, but i was close to the more expensive legal ones. (Now, even though in my country, it's legal, and I'm over the age of consent, it's still illegal for people under the age of 18 to go there.) I saww that there was one just a 20-30 minute walk from my house and fought with my self for the remainder of June and all of July of wether I go there or not. Nearly every day, I passed by there with the intention of going, but I ""chickened"" out and left. I had decided twice that I wasn't going. I would fall that far I would and could continue without it. I decided to use that money to buy tickets for football/volleyball/basketball matches in October when they started again and not to waste it there, and lose myself in the process.

But I didn't. 

August 2nd, it was a wednesday at about 4-5pm I went there again, but this time I didn't leave. I entered the place. I ringed the doorbell, and a middle-aged woman with a strong accent greeted me. There was another dude there, a man with an even stronger accent than her(she barely understood what he said). She lied to him, saying I had called in advance and that he should leave and come back later. She said to me the programs I could follow ranging from 50 the cheapest to 100+ for the most expensive ones. Then came out another customer that had justed ""finished"" and the receptionist said goodbye to him. After a short while, i heard loud footsteps of someone wearing heels. It was the prostitute. She came down wearing only high heels and blueish green panties; she had her long black hair in pigtails, which I did not expect. She was one of the very few women in the business who wasn't a foreigner. She introduced herself, let me get a good look at her, and left. After that, the receptionist asked if I would stay. I said yes and that I would take the cheapest program of 50 for 15 minutes. She guided me upstairs to a room,I gave her the money, she gave me a one time use towel and flip flops and said that the woman would take care of me and would be there in a few minutes. I took off my clothes, had a quick shower, and waited. After a short time, the woman entered the room. I was flabbergasted it was basically the first time I had seen a real half-naked woman up close. I will spare the details, but basically, I couldn't get erect due to my nervousness. The woman got mad and left, which left me also a bit mad, but I also left without making a fuss. 

After that, I went home and then went to church. A few days later, we left for summer vacation on an island. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I felt guilt and shame for the entire month. For context, I also have an addiction to porn which has gotten better over the years, but it's still there. I tried to quit that August for good, but I failed after a few days. In September I went back to that brothel and other brothels near it, I just went to look, I don't know why but I didn't do anything I didn't even have money with me. Now, months later, I finally confessed to a priest for what I've done. It felt good, and I the same time, I stopped watching porn again. It's been three weeks since then. 
But now I feel the temptation again, I want to go back there, I fantasize going back there I haven't enter that website to look at it bcs I know ill fall again but it's been eating me from the inside for the past week. I want to be strong. I want to be better, but I am weak. I hated my experience there, but I liked it. I vowed never to go back there, but i did. I never want to step foot there again, but I long for the day I do. And the worst thing, the reason I haven't gone back there again isn't because I can fight back and keep myself strong but because I don't want to spend so much money. I'm a hypocrite. I take some moral high ground from my classmates, but compared to me, they haven't done anything. So that's it. I'm writing now here fighting to stop myself from going and planning when to go. In the normal days, I could keep myself busy and ignore the urge, but now that's its Christmas break, I can't."	18r4met	i m regret visiting a brothel but struggle to hold myself from going back there	"i apologize if i misword any sentences since english isnt my first language and even if it was im not very good with words

567	Ive been getting free food from McDonald's for a few weeks now.	"I want to start this off by saying that this only works because I have three cars. And there are four different McDonald locations near me.

Sometimes I will drive to McDonald's, go around through the drive-thru, and then pull into the waiting parking spots that they have and just sit out there until an employee notices I'm out there. An employee will be giving someone their food and then they'll come up to my window and ask me how long I have been waiting. I say anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes and they immediately panic and ask what I had. I'll give them my order and then they'll give me food and apologize that they forgot about my food. 

The next day I will go to another location in my car and do this over and over until I've been to all locations in that car and then the next week I will just switch cars and do it all over again. One of the McDonald's has caught on but the other ones have not. 

I might be a bad person but I'm hungry when I'm coming off from work.

568	I stole over a dozen cases of beer after a supervisor gave me access to the warehouse at a store I didn't work at	"A friend and I were shopping at a big lot store in America ( we're Canadian ) He had 2 cases of beer in his cart and decided he only wanted one. I returned the unwanted case to the isle it came from. A woman with a clipboard and business suit starts telling me what I need to do next. I repeatedly try to interrupt her with ""I don't work here"" She just talks louder and over me. At first this was kinda funny that she was just going on and on but she became cruel and insulting with her words. Eventually she just waved me off and said "" Just follow me, you think you can handle that?"" 

Waiting for the ultimate payoff here, i decided to follow her.  Really thought this would turn into a funny story. 

We get to a door that requires a swipe card to enter. She snaps on me when I explain I don't have one cause I don't work here. Thinking this is going to be the moment she realizes she's an asshole and apologizes...I was wrong. 
She swipes her key card and and yells  ""JUST MOVE THR FUCKING BEER RETARD!"" 

I don't like the R word 

I didn't have a plan in mind but figured I'd get her in shit by being in the warehouse so I went in. Alone. Just me with all these cases of beer. 
So you need a key card to get IN but not one to exit the back door. 

I propped it open and started piling cases outside. Called my buddy to bring his truck around and we stocked it full and drove away. 

Its wasn't 100 percent free as we did have to pay duty at customs but that's pennies on the dollar. 

It's been 6 years and I still feel like I'm being watched when I return lol."	18nghe6	i stole over a dozen cases of beer after a supervisor gave me access to the warehouse at a store i didnt work at	"a friend and i were shopping at a big lot store in america  were canadian  he had  cases of beer in his cart and decided he only wanted one i returned the unwanted case to the isle it came from a woman with a clipboard and business suit starts telling me what i need to do next i repeatedly try to interrupt her with i dont work here she just talks louder and over me at first this was kinda funny that she was just going on and on but she became cruel and insulting with her words eventually she just waved me off and said  just follow me you think you can handle that

569	I’m the cause of my friend’s ED getting worse. What is wrong with me	"Feel free to trash on me all you want, I deserve it for what I did. I just need to get this off my chest.

So I am a Twitter user. Big red flag, Ik, but an even bigger red flag is that I’m on Shtwt and Edtwt. I struggle with mostly self harm and occasionally an eating disorder if I decide to not be a fat fuck. And I post my sh because of course I do. I’m an attention seeker and need the validation that my cuts are deep enough.

And I have this friend, who we’ll call Jessie. Me and Jessie have been friends since elementary school. Currently, we are in high school and I found out recently that they have been struggling with self harm. Occasionally I would get triggered or something when they would show their selfharm in public and talk to me about how cool and pretty it was. But that’s just me. 

And one day I was talking about twitter and recommended that they join so that we could post together. They made an account and joined and I showed them some groups to join and some people to follow. I don’t know why I did it, and there’s nothing I can do to talk it back because now they are eating less than 500 calories a day and saying that they are never going to eat a meal again.

And the worst part is that even before they joined twitter they would talk about how my cuts were “goals” and we would encourage each other on our mission to get unhealthily thin. I am a horrible friend and I want to kill myself right now, but I probably deserve it to be honest.

570	I Didn't expose my friends fake accusations, and he ended up taking his life.	"(this is extremely serious)
When I was around 14 or 15 I had just made a twitch account.( I am currently F18)
I had started frequenting twitch so I could make friends, around the time COVID happened.i had been playing fortnite with random people and became friends with a person called rogue.
Sometimes I used to watch his twitch streams and in his chat there was a guy named Dylan who was also a regular teammate of ours. I had become friends with Dylan who also used to stream fortnite. 
We used to frequently play together and I even started moderating for him. He had maybe 70-100 followers at that time. Around middle of August 2020, I had introduced him to  Minecraft and he joined an SMP, which I had joined a few months earlier. I didn't necessarily know any of them IRL, but we followed each other on Instagram. He quickly started frequenting that smp. And we became decent acquaintances with the owner of the SMP and her friend. 
When I had started moderating for Dylan he had told me apparently that he was using a voice changer since he didn't want people to find out he was old (he didn't ever try to hide his age btw) nobody had bothered asking and just assumed he was around our age) and stuff and just wanted to play with people. Which was reasonable as people are very different online. One day during a VC session his voice changer had turned off and the owner of the SMP(barb) and her friend, heard it and made fun of him. But they didn't do much after that. 
One day when we were playing Minecraft, Dylan was banned. And his MC bedrock account had been reported for inappropriate behaviour. And it turned out he had been banned from the discord. Apparently the two girls(barb) (owner and friend) had spread slander about him that he had been sending dick pics to them, who are miinors. Which was a blatant lie. A lot of people then reported him and his twitch and got it banned.
 He was extremely heartbroken as he lost all his efforts on twitch. As long as I had know him he was constantly using all of his money to grow his equipment and his twitch and spent almost every hour on his account. After he lost the account he was super devestated . He rarely talked on his discord alr and he told me he was going to leave for a while. and we didn't have much contact after that
A few months later during 2021 the fortnite friend of ours (Rogue) messaged me. He had informed me that Dylan had unfortunately taken his life. I found out that day that Dylan and rogue were brothers. (Which was  new to me, I had known rogue and Dylan knew each other IRL as Dylan talked a lot about hanging out with rogue )  Dylan played fortnite because he didn't want rogue to play alone and started streaming to kill time. (Btw Rogue was also a minor). 
 He had told me Dylan had ended his life due to being basically banned on social media and being harrassed by the Minecraft SMP server owners brother, and losing all his hard work on twitch. I at that time had known the two girls identities and the brother had asked me if I did , but I said no. This was due to the reason that I had a huge crush on the owner and was close to the owner (barb)( we even online dated for a few months) not thinking straight. The reason I had broken up with the owner was also related to Dylan's death. She had told me later that she and (sam) her friend had just done it as a joke, because they thought he was a sad loser.
I deeply regret not telling the brother. Rogue has also deactivated his socials.
Edit: Also for some more information rogue and Dylan are not the same person jeez. I knew rogue before Dylan and I have seen pictures of rogue on his Instagram. We also played frequently as a trio so it was impossible for him to be rogue and Dylan

one day when we were playing minecraft dylan was banned and his mc bedrock account had been reported for inappropriate behaviour and it turned out he had been banned from the discord apparently the two girlsbarb owner and friend had spread slander about him that he had been sending dick pics to them who are miinors which was a blatant lie a lot of people then reported him and his twitch and got it banned
 he was extremely heartbroken as he lost all his efforts on twitch as long as i had know him he was constantly using all of his money to grow his equipment and his twitch and spent almost every hour on his account after he lost the account he was super devestated  he rarely talked on his discord alr and he told me he was going to leave for a while and we didnt have much contact after that
a few months later during  the fortnite friend of ours rogue messaged me he had informed me that dylan had unfortunately taken his life i found out that day that dylan and rogue were brothers which was  new to me i had known rogue and dylan knew each other irl as dylan talked a lot about hanging out with rogue   dylan played fortnite because he didnt want rogue to play alone and started streaming to kill time btw rogue was also a minor 
 he had told me dylan had ended his life due to being basically banned on social media and being harrassed by the minecraft smp server owners brother and losing all his hard work on twitch i at that time had known the two girls identities and the brother had asked me if i did  but i said no this was due to the reason that i had a huge crush on the owner and was close to the owner barb we even online dated for a few months not thinking straight the reason i had broken up with the owner was also related to dylans death she had told me later that she and sam her friend had just done it as a joke because they thought he was a sad loser
i deeply regret not telling the brother rogue has also deactivated his socials
edit also for some more information rogue and dylan are not the same person jeez i knew rogue before dylan and i have seen pictures of rogue on his instagram we also played frequently as a trio so it was impossible for him to be rogue and dylan

571	I scammed some little kid of a spiked collar on animal jam.	This is probably a ridiculous thing to put here. But I actually feel so bad about it. Back when animal jam was popular, I got bored one day and decided to do trust trades. Now I did this completely with the intent to actually be someone trustworthy. People kept trading me betas, rares, etc. I kept denying, that was until someone trust traded a spike. At first I declined it, but then that temptation set in. When she traded it again I hit accept and teleported away. It wasn’t until I got my account hacked that I realized how much I actually might’ve hurt that girls feelings. The items I had were of no real value to me, but I did work hard and trade lots to get them. Well most of them. But when I got hacked, and my stuff got stolen I felt a tiny pit in my chest. I am so sorry to that girl I scammed and I just gotta say that spike was traded away with a full list of other spikes for a rare headdress that wasn’t even worth it. So I did get my karma. 😭	18mng0z	i scammed some little kid of a spiked collar on animal jam	this is probably a ridiculous thing to put here but i actually feel so bad about it back when animal jam was popular i got bored one day and decided to do trust trades now i did this completely with the intent to actually be someone trustworthy people kept trading me betas rares etc i kept denying that was until someone trust traded a spike at first i declined it but then that temptation set in when she traded it again i hit accept and teleported away it wasnt until i got my account hacked that i realized how much i actually mightve hurt that girls feelings the items i had were of no real value to me but i did work hard and trade lots to get them well most of them but when i got hacked and my stuff got stolen i felt a tiny pit in my chest i am so sorry to that girl i scammed and i just gotta say that spike was traded away with a full list of other spikes for a rare headdress that wasnt even worth it so i did get my karma 	mngz
572	I took $500 from the bank teller knowing it wasn’t mine.	Back in 2012, I was in community college and getting little school checks. Well i received a check for $30, no big deal. I take it to the bank to cash it cuz im broke af and will take what I can get. I get to the teller and hand her my check. She puts it away and prints a receipt sitting it on the counter next to another receipt. I guess she mixed them up bcuz when she started counting out the money and placing it in my hand, it was way more than $30. I froze, didn’t say a thing, and walked out with $500. I never went back to that bank. Gave my mom $100, my brother $100, and kept $300.  I hope that teller found a good job after getting fired.	18mizup	i took  from the bank teller knowing it wasnt mine	back in  i was in community college and getting little school checks well i received a check for  no big deal i take it to the bank to cash it cuz im broke af and will take what i can get i get to the teller and hand her my check she puts it away and prints a receipt sitting it on the counter next to another receipt i guess she mixed them up bcuz when she started counting out the money and placing it in my hand it was way more than  i froze didnt say a thing and walked out with  i never went back to that bank gave my mom  my brother  and kept   i hope that teller found a good job after getting fired	mizup
573	I threw a Starbucks drink out of a school bus window	It’s something that I am not proud of to this day. I was on my way home from a school trip during the summer before my junior year of high school so this was roughly about 13 years ago, I had gotten one of those glass bottles of Starbucks mocha latte drinks from a pit stop. Well the school bus was driving right along when I finished my drink and so I decided to throw the bottle out of the window while the bus was still moving.	18mi393	i threw a starbucks drink out of a school bus window	its something that i am not proud of to this day i was on my way home from a school trip during the summer before my junior year of high school so this was roughly about  years ago i had gotten one of those glass bottles of starbucks mocha latte drinks from a pit stop well the school bus was driving right along when i finished my drink and so i decided to throw the bottle out of the window while the bus was still moving	mi

575	I cut this girls hair all the time in elementary school	Idk what it was, but when I was in middle school, this girl in front of me had long blonde hair, and I remember one day just grabbing a pair of scissors and since nobody was paying attention, I cut a little off. I didn’t even feel bad at the time, and nobody said anything, and she didn’t even notice. So I did it again and again and again, until one day, I went for the big snip, and mid chop the teacher noticed but by that point it was too late. The next time she came to school, her hair was way shorter, like a short Bob from her hair being all the way down her back. I got scolded by the teacher, by my parents, and the girl never sat in front of me again. Each person that sat in front of my was pretty wary, and the teacher paid special attention to me. But at the time, I didn’t even think I did a bad thing. Now as an adult, I actually realize that was an insane thing to do, and I feel a bit bad, but idk what it is, but I feel like I would do it again. I’m not even sure I feel too much remorse, but it was wrong to do. It’s not something to find funny, but it’s truly insane to look back on, thinking about how I got scolded by my mom and she asked me why I did it, and I told her idk, no reason really, just wanted to, I can’t help but laugh in disbelief. In hindsight, it feels like I was unhinged as a child and to the girl whose hair I chopped off for no reason, I hope your hair grew back out and you completely forgot about me when I moved away.	18m1gce	i cut this girls hair all the time in elementary school	idk what it was but when i was in middle school this girl in front of me had long blonde hair and i remember one day just grabbing a pair of scissors and since nobody was paying attention i cut a little off i didnt even feel bad at the time and nobody said anything and she didnt even notice so i did it again and again and again until one day i went for the big snip and mid chop the teacher noticed but by that point it was too late the next time she came to school her hair was way shorter like a short bob from her hair being all the way down her back i got scolded by the teacher by my parents and the girl never sat in front of me again each person that sat in front of my was pretty wary and the teacher paid special attention to me but at the time i didnt even think i did a bad thing now as an adult i actually realize that was an insane thing to do and i feel a bit bad but idk what it is but i feel like i would do it again im not even sure i feel too much remorse but it was wrong to do its not something to find funny but its truly insane to look back on thinking about how i got scolded by my mom and she asked me why i did it and i told her idk no reason really just wanted to i cant help but laugh in disbelief in hindsight it feels like i was unhinged as a child and to the girl whose hair i chopped off for no reason i hope your hair grew back out and you completely forgot about me when i moved away	mgce

577	I’ve been faking being from UK for 6 years and it’s gone way too far	"I’m using a throwaway account because I don’t want my friends to find my main account.

In 6th grade, my family and I moved to another state because of a new job that my mother had gotten. This was the first time in my life where I would be the “new kid” so I wanted to spice it up a little. When I started school the next week and had to introduce myself to the class, I decided to lie and say that I was a transfer student from the UK. I had the British accent and everything.

Everybody was interested in being my friend since I was “British” and they asked me a lot about how school and life was in the UK. Instead of just giving up the joke then and there, I went home and researched a bunch about the UK and came back the next day and explained everything I had researched, and people actually believed me.

My plan was to pull out of the joke after a few days but eventually I got too far in to actually stop. I sometimes ordered British snacks from online stores and brought them to school for my friends to try. My friends also gave me “American” snacks and I had to pretend that I had never tried them before.

I’m in 11th grade now and all my friends and peers from that school still actually think I’m British. I know this isn’t as horrible as the other confessions on here but I’m feeling really guilty about lying about this for so long and need to get this off my chest. As soon as I get home I switch back to my normal voice, but sometimes, I even have trouble switching back to my regular voice because of how much I use the British accent.
 
I don’t know what to do because I even lied and told my friends that I’m going back to the UK for summer vacation and they told me to send pics of my family down there when I go. I honestly don’t know what to do at this point. I feel bad for lying this long but I feel like it’s been too long to pull out of this… idk.. just needed to get this off my chest and maybe some advice."	18lpd3m	ive been faking being from uk for  years and its gone way too far	"im using a throwaway account because i dont want my friends to find my main account

578	I scammed Temu and now I lost half a thousand dollars	"Okay, so I thought I was scamming Temu but now I’m in debt. Not actually lmao but here’s how the story went. I had like $1 in my account and there was something I really wanted that was $1.89 so I thought “Oh we’ll just see what happens” so I bought it and looked at my account and I still had $1 in my account. I was thinking “huh thats strange” but didn’t think anything of it. Fast forward I get ten dollars so I do what any other irresponsible kid does, I spent it as soon as I got it. I bought the items, but still had $11. So I’m thinking it’s probably not going through. So I get the package but check my account and there staring right back at me was the crisp digits of 11. So I’m thinking this is an absolute miracle. So I go ballistic, buying stuff I could never imagine affording (electric guitar and other items). These packages are getting delivered but my money stays. Then one day I go to school absolutely balling with my Temu accessories my mom calls me in the middle of class. 

“We just lost 500 dollars.”

I AM ABSOLUTELY SHITTING BRICKS. I am so scared I tried canceling my cool ass orders but nothings working. I’m freaking out my friends are laughing at me my moms screaming. It didn’t take 500 from my account, it took it FROM MY DEAREST MOTHERS. When I got home that day I was sworn never to see the light of day again.

579	I gave my sister brain damage as a child, resulting in her decreased ability to visualize.	I have felt guilty about doing this one thing ever since I was a child. I must've been around 12 years old when my female cousin who was around 10-11 at the time showed me a trend on musically and it involved 2 people turning someone around. I felt a little hesitant but I still agreed to do it. So she suggested we did it to my little sister who was around 6 at the time, and as we were doing it we must have missed a fundamental step in this stupid trend and my sister fell vertically on her head by a good couple inches and started crying. Recently I was talking to her about it, joking that I gave her brain damage and she said she didn't remember the event, but as we talked about it she said she suddenly remembered and said that immediately after it happened her mental imagery (visualization) decreased significantly, to a point where she now hardly visualizes, she still visualizes but the mental images are not strong. After she's told me that I've been eating myself alive ever since, I don't know how to live with myself. Now I'm not sure whether people would call this a disproportionate reaction all things considered (she didn't completely lose her ability to visualize) but the fact that I obeyed my cousin like that so easily and ended up decreasing my sister's quality of life has made me feel like shit, and I don't know what to do.	18ljpyt	i gave my sister brain damage as a child resulting in her decreased ability to visualize	i have felt guilty about doing this one thing ever since i was a child i mustve been around  years old when my female cousin who was around  at the time showed me a trend on musically and it involved  people turning someone around i felt a little hesitant but i still agreed to do it so she suggested we did it to my little sister who was around  at the time and as we were doing it we must have missed a fundamental step in this stupid trend and my sister fell vertically on her head by a good couple inches and started crying recently i was talking to her about it joking that i gave her brain damage and she said she didnt remember the event but as we talked about it she said she suddenly remembered and said that immediately after it happened her mental imagery visualization decreased significantly to a point where she now hardly visualizes she still visualizes but the mental images are not strong after shes told me that ive been eating myself alive ever since i dont know how to live with myself now im not sure whether people would call this a disproportionate reaction all things considered she didnt completely lose her ability to visualize but the fact that i obeyed my cousin like that so easily and ended up decreasing my sisters quality of life has made me feel like shit and i dont know what to do	ljpyt
580	I laughed (in private) at a close friend’s insecurity	"My friend (27f) had really bad pms.  Short tempered, crying at a random inconvenience, super impatient.  This starts the week before her period and lasts until a few days after, so about 2-2.5 weeks out of the month.  For the last few years she’s had the suspicion that it’s from her hormones from her birth control (she’s also disappointed it didn’t get rid of her periods like what usually happens. She finally talked to a nurse about switching it out for a copper iud, to which the nurse said, “oh no, your brand of iud isn’t supposed to affect any of that.  Your period’s not supposed to go away, and none of the iuds should affect your mood.”  I wouldn’t dare do it out loud, but I had a good chuckle when she called us after crying about how it’s not her hormones and that she’s just a bitch.  I feel bad for her, but I’m also tired of her using her period as an excuse to be mad half the time we talk and hang out.

Edit: so she’s currently on kyleena, not Mirena.  The nurse said kyleena is not meant to stop your period, just lessen them (hers are as frequent as before but lighter).  I used to have mirena and switched over to copper just because I used to get super hot flashes.  She used to be on the pill but with her adhd and depression (she’s medicated for both) she didn’t take it 100% consistently which ended up with a big pregnancy scare.  She wanted something with less maintenance so Planned Parenthood suggested an iud.  The only reason she hasn’t switched to copper yet is because how much it hurt being put in, and then having it removed and a new one inserted when the first one started slipping out after a year.  She fully plans on getting it removed and having kids in the next 2-5 years with her partner.
She’s aware she’s a bitch.  The laughing was just the delivery of the line “I am just a bitch”. The post is here because she doesn’t need to know I secretly actually agree with her instead of the usual “oh no you’re fine, good ol’ pms haha”
The next time she seriously complains about her mood swings I will bring up pmdd but I also know she’s discussed this with two different nurses at PP, and her mom, her aunt, and my mom who are also nurses.  They both think it’s just regular pms not related to her birth control.  We’ve all just agreed, she can be a bitch."	18lhn46	i laughed in private at a close friends insecurity	"my friend f had really bad pms  short tempered crying at a random inconvenience super impatient  this starts the week before her period and lasts until a few days after so about  weeks out of the month  for the last few years shes had the suspicion that its from her hormones from her birth control shes also disappointed it didnt get rid of her periods like what usually happens she finally talked to a nurse about switching it out for a copper iud to which the nurse said oh no your brand of iud isnt supposed to affect any of that  your periods not supposed to go away and none of the iuds should affect your mood  i wouldnt dare do it out loud but i had a good chuckle when she called us after crying about how its not her hormones and that shes just a bitch  i feel bad for her but im also tired of her using her period as an excuse to be mad half the time we talk and hang out

582	Haven’t paid for an bus ticket for the past 4 years	"So I live in an pretty big city with about 2 million people and we an amazing public transport system…. Expect for the pricing. A few years ago it was about 2$ for an ticket that you could use on any bus, train or boat in my city, but every year they increase the costs for an ticket. Now it’s 3.6 $! Now if I have to get from and to work every day that’s about 7$, and we’ll that’s just out of my budget, so for the the past 4 years I’ve been illegally trespassing the vehicles. Now let me tell you about how all of the vehicles work, the trains are the easiest to get into for free as you just have to jump over the half door or Wall behind someone paying. Now the busses are a bit more complicated, here you have to use social engineering by telling the buss driver you either forgot your wallet or don’t have enough money and really need to get home, or you could use the doors at the end of the bus but the driver will almost always ask you to leave and this is very shamed upon. And the boats are almost impossible to get into without paying as there are always guys at the entrance checking for tickets.

Now I’m not the only one illegally getting onto the public transport vehicles, there’s a lot of people doing it.

Recently I’ve been just walking to work but this takes about an hour and I hate riding a bike so that’s not an option

585	I threw a drink through a lady’s open car window..	"I threw a drink through a lady’s open car window..

I(28f) was around 19 and leaving my work. This woman was driving recklessly weaving off of the road to get around people and then stopping in front of them and proceeded to run me off of the road. When I got back on the road behind her she kept slowing down and acting like she was moving off of the road so that when I’d try to pass her she would try to hit my car. 

The one lane then split into two; a straight lane and a right- hand turning lane. I decided to go straight. No one was behind me and the person in front of her was taking forever to turn. I’m assuming they didn’t realize the light was green. My windows were down and so was her driver’s side window. I chucked my fountain drink from my lunch break through her window and went straight. 

For context, I’m usually a very patient person… to the point where someone could be a straight up asshole to me, and I’ll think to myself, “Are they okay? They must be having a bad day,” and I’ll let it go. But something in me that day just was not having it. 

I know what I did was wrong, believe me. As I was driving off, I immediately thought, “Maybe that wasn’t the right thing to do.” I’m not saying what she did was right either. I mean… it’s not like she was weaving around people because of an emergency if she had time to sit there and fuck with people, right?

Back in those days if you bought something that was $5 with a $100 gift certificate they would give you $95 change in cash.

589	Made a mistake at leaving this life and am now in limbo 3 weeks later	"On 30 Nov after careful planning and preparation I (48m) failed in my attempt to die.

For more than 12 months I’ve been trying to live after I decided in 2022 that I wanted to die. In Oct 2023 I concluded definately that I want to die. 

I’m married for 18y with 3 daughters and co-own a couple of businesses we started after exiting successful corporate career of 23y.

Dying was something I communicated since Oct to my wife. I made the decision and commitment that my death won’t be a trauma event (shooting / hanging etc) - linked to discovery of my body. I found the right medicine to achieve the outcome required. A simple go to sleep medicine.

I asked friends whom I had confided in to help my wife after my death with running the businesses, making decisions and setting my wife and kids up for a better life after my death.  We spent a couple of hours together before 30 Nov where they asked me details relating to the businesses and how my wife wanted to be helped to enable them all to help my wife after 30 Nov(she was in the session as well)

I’ve been socially distant in home life, I didn’t want to partake in fun events and was happy to be left alone in house full of people. We did not want my kids to know at this point in their lives I decided to die and started explaining how my blood pressure and heart was giving Drs concern - trying to lay path of heart attack as cause of death to them. 

I’ve been diagnosed with depression (30y) and refused to be exposed to treatments that “artificially” make me come across as happy - I believe in being authentic and chemical / medicine treatment alters me… perhaps in the most respectful way possible it is similar to me refusing treatment for terminal illness I just don’t want treatment. I have a strong - do not ressusitate - living will form in case medical decisions must be made.

In my life I’ve had sleep therapy, shock therapy range of different antidepressants and anxiety medicines, natural treatments and even with these fully amped up - I rationally and cognitively decided to die and communicated this to my close friends and wife. 

I confirmed with my financial advisor that all financial instruments are in good standing and my wife will have millions to start new life. I spend 2-3weeks preparing with her what that life could look like and how embracing it is important or my dying will not achieve the better life I want for her and the kids. 

I’m clear that me being half living, irritable and reclusive is not in any of their interests… I’m doing harm by being this way amongst them.

I prayed with a preacher for my sins (there are many 😂) and for forgiveness of what I was going to do 30 Nov. 

I said goodbye and blessed my wife on her new journey and wished her a joyful, loving, meaningful and purposeful life… we had a peaceful ending.

And then I made a mistake in how I took my medicine. To avoid gagging or vomiting on the metallic taste of the medicine I consumed it with something that impacted the effectiveness. Silly mistake and I should have know better…

The real issue is the 3 weeks since… people that knew and was part of the day on 30 Nov especially my wife - don’t know how to react or engage with me… to be honest it took me a proper week to starting thinking again… having resolved that I’m dying… I had no future plans, thoughts or intentions… I had nothing.

They had nothing for me as I was not suppose to be there…

Given how hard it’s been over 3 weeks to find connection with especially my wife again - I’m clear and resolved that I should see through what I had started and die. I can’t blame my wife as the future world I promised her after my death was compelling… not having it now must be disappointing 

What I’ve learned:
- if I’ve decided to die, do it - don’t mess it up. It’s really hard for people to adjust to you living if they were prepared that you were dying.
- as good as I thought it was to prepare people that I’m choosing to die, most people do not know how to respond to that scenario
- don’t tell my wife that it’s happening eg at this time on this day, the emotional distress is too much, rather let the natural instinct and reaction be her guide
- being comfortable to die, is not easy process for those that are continuing to live to accept or understand
- making a mistake and not die was not a scenario any of us were prepared for..
- even if people say they don’t judge, they do. Being around after mistake of not dying… means you are around to be the object of their emotional distress, and anger aimed at you - to be honest that’s fair - I did after all cause the state of things 
- don’t promise people that you’ve decided to live if you haven’t committed to yourself
- being in limbo is hard, no one is reaching into your world to help as you’ve done good job at communicating your decision. 
Make this in between time as short as possible - 3 weeks is too long as nothing changed. I have before and after in my consciousness but with nothing changed in mind or action, I’m in a world similar to being a fish out of water, I don’t belong anymore

The post is to express my experience and not to gather advice or seek support in living. It’s the only place I could think of sharing reflections on my journey.
 
Thank you for this opportunity

Edit 1:
The number of people responding surprised me and out of respect I wanted to validate and engage as many replies as possible. 

Each of the replies took time and I value what was expressed even if i do not fully agree. 

This has however taken substantially energy from me and I’m exhausted. I’ll not be responding further until I’ve recharged and taken stock of all the feedback.

591	I dropped out of university without telling my parents and lied to them about my grades	When I was in college I was struggling and got poor grades to the point that I decided to lie to them about it. Despite me working a part time job, my parents were paying my tuition and basically everything. Everytime they’d ask me how’s uni, I’d tell them fake marks even though I was close to academic probation one semester. I couldn’t tell them anything about my struggles otherwise they’d pull me out of university. So I decided to drop out without telling them and get a CDL at a nearby community college, which I fully funded myself. And I’ve been working as a truck driver ever since.	18ivy3q	i dropped out of university without telling my parents and lied to them about my grades	when i was in college i was struggling and got poor grades to the point that i decided to lie to them about it despite me working a part time job my parents were paying my tuition and basically everything everytime theyd ask me hows uni id tell them fake marks even though i was close to academic probation one semester i couldnt tell them anything about my struggles otherwise theyd pull me out of university so i decided to drop out without telling them and get a cdl at a nearby community college which i fully funded myself and ive been working as a truck driver ever since	ivyq
592	I've tried to off myself multiple times this year, all unsuccessfully.	"Grew up in a shit home with a Mormon Karen for a mom, no father, mom never liked me, she later died in my arms at 20 and I tried to revive her but was unsuccessful. No parents at 20 and spiraled into incredible depression. And now I'm 30, no wife, no kids, I recluse as much as I can. And this year I've tried to commit the big ol S multiple times, either I was too scared or I just woke up vomiting. I think my co-workers and friend are all either oblivious or don't care. 

I'm not really wanting sympathy (even though it sounds like it), mostly it just feels nice to finally say it. That's all.

EDIT: I honestly wrote this fully expecting nobody to give a shit, and I was wildly surprised, I'm so sorry if I haven't replied to your comments but I promise I have read every single one and I thank you so so so so much for taking time to write such nice things. 

I'm taking the advice to see a therapist ASAP even though it's a very scary thought to me. I realize that it's possible that my depression could be helped even a little with medication. Also getting a good hobby that I can put some effort into. 

I have to admit that after writing this I had a full-blown panic attack and cried for a while. I am just at a low point. Possibly the lowest point. I'm so sorry for making everyone worry and I am going to return the favor and try to better myself immediately. I will keep anyone updated who wishes to know. Again thank you so so so much.

593	I broke into someone's apartment, even though I didn't do anything it still terrifies me to this day	"I used to work at a job that had me open and close the building, me and a few others had access to the keys but other workers were not to be trusted with them because they've let in friends before opening time and locked the doors while their friends were still inside. This key, it looked just like my apartment building key. 

One day, I went into my building and into my apartment, and I noticed I was using my workplace key. I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised. The keys looked the same and the ridges/teeth were fairly similar. During winter break, I decided I wanted to fuck around. So, when I noticed that majority of my building had left to go home, and multiple days I would hear no one or see no one on my floor, I unlocked my next door neighbors door. It unlocked! But I was afraid someone was home, so I slightly opened the door and went back to my apartment for several hours. Around 3AM, I went to go check if the door was still open, and it was. So, I let myself in. I looked around, they had nice things, usual college guy stuff, football flags, gaming consoles, camo design furniture. I walked around their apartment for a bit, I went into everyone's room except one because it was locked. When I was done looking around, I got scared someone was home because a door was locked and I don't know if anyone would walk in. So, I quickly ran out and back into my apartment. I didn't lock the door before I left, but I assumed I could do it when I woke up. 

When I woke up, all I could think about is if I got caught, I could've went to prison. Would it be my work place's fault for providing a building key that's actually a master key to my apartment? Or would it be my fault for attempting? All these questions popped up in my head like what would've happened, who could've been home, if I did something specific would I have gotten caught, etc. Later around 3AM again, I went to go check the door. And it was locked! I was terrified, someone probably was home.

Before I quit my job, I told my boss the building key can get into my apartment but not my room (that was a lie), so that maybe they'll install a new lock or a new door and change they keys. My job was near campus, and my apartment is on campus, so the chances of someone else finding out is possible.   am just glad I didn't get caught, but I wanted to share this because even though it is dangerous I laugh about it because I am stupid. I don't know why I tried to fuck around and find out, I really tried to ruin my life. I think of scenarios of being caught and I get frightened terribly when I do that, even just writing all of this was hard.

595	I can’t tell my customers that the espresso they’re drinking is actually decaf	"This week, I’m training as a barista in a coffee shop so I can get extra hours.  I actually really like the job and while it can be hectic at times, it can be kind of fun.

Yesterday, I found out that we ran out of regular espresso beans, which was a problem since most of our drinks needed espresso.  At first, I was told to tell customers we were out of it and offer other options, but this made people upset and drove business away, so my boss eventually told me just to use decaf espresso and not tell customers about it. According to my boss, we’re completely out of regular espresso and probably won’t get anymore for a few days due to shipping delays, so to avoid conflict, we have to use our decaf instead. 

I’m an honest person and it bugs me to keep my mouth shut about it.  I even told this to my parents and they were really upset that I would lie to people about this and warned me that eventually, someone would figure out the difference.  I feel so guilty about it, but at the same time, there’s not much I can do.  A coffee shop without caffeine is like a bakery that doesn’t sell bread and wouldn’t look good for my company.  But lying is also something that goes against my morals and I just feel wrong staying quiet.  All I can do is add extra espresso and hope it makes it a bit stronger, but it’s all I’m able to do.

I wonder if this is something other coffee shops do.  I’ve never worked in one before so I don’t know the common problems a coffee shop would deal with or if they would have to make a choice like this."	18ia8x3	i cant tell my customers that the espresso theyre drinking is actually decaf	"this week im training as a barista in a coffee shop so i can get extra hours  i actually really like the job and while it can be hectic at times it can be kind of fun

596	I lied about seeing angels as a kid and now my mom thinks I’m “spiritually gifted”	"So when I was a kid, I didn’t get much attention from my parents because I was homeschooled and didn’t need as much help academically as my siblings so I ended up being on my own most of the time. I usually got attention by throwing fits/tantrums so bad that they simply could not be ignored, and it worked, but I hated how my family hated me because of my tantrums and how I couldn’t be taken outside of my house because my parents believed I would throw a fit over something small-which was fair because I did often do that. 
Anyway, I knew my mom was (and still is) very religious and believed in guardian angels and that she was very naive and gullible, so I decided I would tell her I saw angels at night and that they talked to me and stuff like that. She ate it up no question and for a while I got a good amount of positive attention because of it until she eventually forgot about it or didn’t care anymore-or at least that’s what I thought she did. Turns out, she remembers and now she’s even MORE religious and is super into prophets and healing prayer and spiritual gifts and believes that because i was visited by angels, I must have some gifts or blessings from God of some kind. I’ve tried telling her I made the angel thing up for attention but she doesn’t believe me because apparently a kid as young as I was (I was around 7/8) wouldn’t be able to make up a lie like that. It’s getting irritating because she tells people I’m “blessed” or something but I’m not and she refuses to believe me when I say it never happened and now I have this weird mix of guilt and anger and I’m just not sure what to do or even if I should do anything at all. I guess I just wanted to rant about it because I feel like my mom is crazy and is obsessed with the idea of one of her kids having powers from God and I am the kid she chose to project her delusions on. She puts a lot of pressure on me to have these abilities that are impossible and inhuman and she tries to drag me into her church groups and spiritual circles because she thinks I have some connection to the “other world” but I don’t have the ability to do what she wants me to do, nor do I care enough to even pretend like I can do this stuff because I’m just so fed up with her spiritual crap. 

Also as a side note my mom calls my family’s history of mental illness a “generational curse” and she thinks my battles with depression that I’ve had since childhood are “spiritual attacks” and she uses my mental illness as “proof” that I’m spiritually gifted because, according to her, I would not be “attacked” if I wasn’t powerful. (I think she’s kind of insane, to be honest.)"	18h5uw6	i lied about seeing angels as a kid and now my mom thinks im spiritually gifted	"so when i was a kid i didnt get much attention from my parents because i was homeschooled and didnt need as much help academically as my siblings so i ended up being on my own most of the time i usually got attention by throwing fitstantrums so bad that they simply could not be ignored and it worked but i hated how my family hated me because of my tantrums and how i couldnt be taken outside of my house because my parents believed i would throw a fit over something smallwhich was fair because i did often do that 
anyway i knew my mom was and still is very religious and believed in guardian angels and that she was very naive and gullible so i decided i would tell her i saw angels at night and that they talked to me and stuff like that she ate it up no question and for a while i got a good amount of positive attention because of it until she eventually forgot about it or didnt care anymoreor at least thats what i thought she did turns out she remembers and now shes even more religious and is super into prophets and healing prayer and spiritual gifts and believes that because i was visited by angels i must have some gifts or blessings from god of some kind ive tried telling her i made the angel thing up for attention but she doesnt believe me because apparently a kid as young as i was i was around  wouldnt be able to make up a lie like that its getting irritating because she tells people im blessed or something but im not and she refuses to believe me when i say it never happened and now i have this weird mix of guilt and anger and im just not sure what to do or even if i should do anything at all i guess i just wanted to rant about it because i feel like my mom is crazy and is obsessed with the idea of one of her kids having powers from god and i am the kid she chose to project her delusions on she puts a lot of pressure on me to have these abilities that are impossible and inhuman and she tries to drag me into her church groups and spiritual circles because she thinks i have some connection to the other world but i dont have the ability to do what she wants me to do nor do i care enough to even pretend like i can do this stuff because im just so fed up with her spiritual crap

597	I flashed some builders on the way home from work.	"Roughly a month ago, I was driving home from work when I stopped at a red light. A van with a couple of builders pulled alongside me, they seemed to be joking around looking at me, I made eye contact with the passanger (who was pretty good looking) who mouthed to me..
""flash"" with a cheeky wink afterwards. I'm not sure what came over me, but I felt excited and a little turned on for some reason. I turned away for a second to think then looked back at them. Ilifted up my top with both hands (I didn't have a bra on) and flashed them for a few seconds before smiling. The light turned green a moment later and I drove off.
I was pretty excited as I drove home, I thought it would be a fun little secret however I've been debating over the last week if I need to tell my boyfriend. We've been together over 3 years now and I do see a future with him. I feel slightly guilty as I'm not sure he would find it funny or take it badly."	18h1yxk	i flashed some builders on the way home from work	"roughly a month ago i was driving home from work when i stopped at a red light a van with a couple of builders pulled alongside me they seemed to be joking around looking at me i made eye contact with the passanger who was pretty good looking who mouthed to me

598	So I poured a bootle of juice out off my third floor classroom and accidently got two girls wet.	"So this happened I was In grade eight.

So first I found a plastic pepsi botle with some juice filled in it, then procceded to just take it everywhere with me since I thought I could get atleast 10 cnt of the deposit.

Procceded to get to my last class 

(Class hour, I dont know if other countries have this Its where the teacher assigned to take care of you all has a chat with you about important/relevent stuff)

After she is done talking I am given a piece off paper where I am supposed to input my grades and sorts (to show that I am aware off my shitty grades)
So everyone leaves since the lesson is finnished, then the teacher too since she was taking documents to another place.

So there I am alone with a pepsi botle with juice in my hand, begging to be emptied

So I procceded to open the third floor window and wait for 10 seconds if I could hear anything (I could not see the bottom since of the thick structure of the school)
10 seconds pass, silence (Well time to pour it!)

Then poured said juice, And then -SPLASH- (Silence for a solid 2 seconds)

And then I heared 2 girls (around 5 grade) scream 
-AAAHHHHH-

Then out of fear I quickly closed the window put the givven paper on my teachers desk took my shit and left the school.

Worst thing Its the cold season like now, wich reminded me of this event.

If I remember some snow fell off the window too after I quickly shut it due to the wind, force and vibration.

599	My substitute pe teacher stared at me with only a bra on	So in my pe class we had a substitute one day and she was in the locker room, nothing out of the ordinary but when she was walking out she just stopped and stared at breasts in only a bra and kept staring even while walking out of the locker room. I’m I being dramatic or do I have a right to feel uncomfortable?	18gcvyq	my substitute pe teacher stared at me with only a bra on	so in my pe class we had a substitute one day and she was in the locker room nothing out of the ordinary but when she was walking out she just stopped and stared at breasts in only a bra and kept staring even while walking out of the locker room im i being dramatic or do i have a right to feel uncomfortable	gcvyq
600	I added a small tip to a receipt at a crowded bar because the rude men didn’t tip	This maybe isn’t as bad as some, but I’ve been feeling guilty about it lately. About a year ago I was at a very crowded bar with my friends in the city. The basement bar area was wall to wall with people. I waited for probably 15 minutes at the bar to order a drink. There was a loud group of douchey looking men in front of me. They’d ordered a ton of drinks, were rude to the bartender, and I heard them make multiple disgusting sexual remarks about her. I finally got up to the bar after they’d paid, and their receipt was still out. It was a tab of over $150 and they’d written 0.00 in the tip line. I didn’t see them put any cash in the tip jar. I added a 1 quickly to make the tip $10. Realistically, I know they probably did not notice the extra $10 charge on their account. I didn’t really feel too bad about this until I told a group of my friends about it recently during a drinking game and they all made really judgmental faces. Would I do this again? Probably not. And not because I don’t think they deserve it, but more because I value not getting in trouble and what I did was illegal. I also wouldn’t want to jeopardize the bartender’s job or have her be accused of theft when it was me.	18g2ehg	i added a small tip to a receipt at a crowded bar because the rude men didnt tip	this maybe isnt as bad as some but ive been feeling guilty about it lately about a year ago i was at a very crowded bar with my friends in the city the basement bar area was wall to wall with people i waited for probably  minutes at the bar to order a drink there was a loud group of douchey looking men in front of me theyd ordered a ton of drinks were rude to the bartender and i heard them make multiple disgusting sexual remarks about her i finally got up to the bar after theyd paid and their receipt was still out it was a tab of over  and theyd written  in the tip line i didnt see them put any cash in the tip jar i added a  quickly to make the tip  realistically i know they probably did not notice the extra  charge on their account i didnt really feel too bad about this until i told a group of my friends about it recently during a drinking game and they all made really judgmental faces would i do this again probably not and not because i dont think they deserve it but more because i value not getting in trouble and what i did was illegal i also wouldnt want to jeopardize the bartenders job or have her be accused of theft when it was me	gehg
601	I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I stole chocolate	I don’t have much of spare cash but I’ve enough to buy necessities and nice stuff sometimes. Yesterday I went Walmart pharmacy and I had to go through the candy section. I noticed that couple of packs of Turtles Original were open and I just took one and put it in my pants to eat later on. I’ve shit load of chocolates at home because I bought a couple of packs during the Halloween sale. I’m not eating those but I want to steal and eat?! I generally don’t have shoplifting issue and generally my moral compass has been good like I’d help out friends and family, regularly try to donate to charities (not much but like $10-20 here and there). The worst is, I don’t know for sure if I’d not be doing this again. In my 41 years of life, I’ve done this for the second time.

But back in year 9 secondary school (uk so 8th grade for Americans) I sat next to this girl in science, let’s call her AG (asthmatic girl).

She had severe asthma like super bad. She had been picked up from school in an ambulance because of it kind of bad.

It got set off by any kind of smell or temperature of air.

One time we were sitting in science and i suddenly really needed to fart. I completely forgot  she was asthmatic and I farted. You couldn’t hear it but it must have smelt because in like thirty seconds she was coughing and had to stand outside the classroom with her inhaler.

604	I became an expert shot with a wrist rocket fired from a moving car	When I was 19, my buddies and I would drive around Friday and Saturday nights shooting out windows with a wrist rocket and rocks or marbles. We fucked up cars, houses, disposable homes, buses, schools, offices, stores... anything with glass within 75 yards of the road. It was perfect, since other vandals used BB guns and no one expected a rock coming through their living room window to have anything to do with a car driving by on a busy road. I'd say I scored a glass-shattering hit 85% of my shots, (sometimes from 200 feet away going 55 mph perpendicular to the target.)I hit the metal siding of a disposable home (single wide trailer) at 11:00 pm one night and the bedroom light came on immediately! It sounded like a car crash from my viewpoint at 55 mph...so, we waited until 12:00 am and hit it again with identical results.	18evgna	i became an expert shot with a wrist rocket fired from a moving car	when i was  my buddies and i would drive around friday and saturday nights shooting out windows with a wrist rocket and rocks or marbles we fucked up cars houses disposable homes buses schools offices stores anything with glass within  yards of the road it was perfect since other vandals used bb guns and no one expected a rock coming through their living room window to have anything to do with a car driving by on a busy road id say i scored a glassshattering hit  of my shots sometimes from  feet away going  mph perpendicular to the targeti hit the metal siding of a disposable home single wide trailer at  pm one night and the bedroom light came on immediately it sounded like a car crash from my viewpoint at  mphso we waited until  am and hit it again with identical results	evgna

There was also this fake app that had voice clips of them talking so you could pretend you were calling them, so I used that and she obviously believed it because we live in Texas and our asses did NOT know how to speak Korean. Looking back, no harm done and it was kinda funny- but everytime I listen to them I can’t help but think if she still thinks that.

Everytime I'm going to the supermarket, I'm finding myself stealing at least one product, if it's a chocolate or fruits or meats, but sometimes even more then 50% of my cart's value. I keep my boundaries only to the big places, like supermarkets and big stores, so private people won't truly get hurt. I don't know if I like the danger or if I'm just being cheap.

609	I stole $400 for my classes school camp and never got caught.	"When I was in intermediate school (middle school for the Americans) We'd have this night market type shit at my school where you'd sell the food your classmates made to fund the trip.

I really wanted all that money to buy some weed so I just stole it and ran home. When I arrived to school the next day everybody in my class was freaking out, because if they didn't find the money they would miss out on going to camp. Long story short they didn't find it and ended up having to miss out.

610	Made an horrible joke on my first high school trip	"We went abroad and I was sharing the room with other 2 boys. 
There was this good boy who was a bit slow (bless him) but I considered one of my only friends in my class and we were always smiling and joking.
The journey to get to the hotel was 10 hours by bus , and I can’t use public restrooms so the whole trip I couldn’t do a number 2. On the shared bedroom it was me, this friend of mine and another guy who was kind of a bully.
We entered the room, and I really needed to go to the restroom, but we were all euphoric and for a sec there I didn’t feel it anymore. I don’t remember the details very well anymore since it’s been a long time, all I can remember is that the bully, jokingly grabbed this friend of mine and was holding him down on the bed (my friend was laughing) and shouted at me to do something at him since he had him trapped (he couldn’t move nor cover his face with his hands). The only things I remember is that I was there and I immediately thought : would be so fricking funny if I would fart on his face. In matter of a couples of seconds, I jumped on the bed, dropped my pants, squatted and made a huge fart on his face. I would have never imagined that with the fart, something else would have come out but it did. It wasn’t much but it was wet. Me and him never had the same relationship anymore and I think he started hating me from that moment.

614	I got away with working from home when I shouldn't have been	"I started working for a company during the pandemic and everyone was working from home. That is until the Return to office emails started circulating saying that attendance would be tracked and refusal to come in would result in disciplinary/dismissal. The Company has tried to implement other draconian policies in the past that people just refused to do and these dictats pretty much always went away in the end so I tried my luck and I just continued working from home.

I found out that other colleagues were getting constant reminders and threatening emails if they didn't turn up for their allocated days but I recieved nothing. A fairly large number refused to come in and were either let go or found new jobs before they were let go. (The company is still losing many people and it seems like soon they're only going to be left with graduates and top level managers)

I didn't understand why I was being left alone until I was on a call with one of the managers and the conversation of losing lots of staff came up. He said ""They weren't smart like you and didn't ask for a wfh contract when they started"". The only thing is that I never had a wfh contract and I never told anyone I did.

Technically I didn't outright lie but he had somehow gotten the impression that I had a work from home contract and I just didn't correct him. At that moment I realised why I had not met the same fate as other colleagues.

I'm leaving the company now anyway because I've found a better job with full time wfh written into my contract + better pay and benefits. 

Its been just under a year since they started trying to force attendance and it seems like ive managed to get away with it. If I stayed at the company I'm sure I would eventually get found out by someone who bothered to actually investigate but i guess I've never raised any red flags because my work has always been good quality, completed on time and I've never caused a ruckus.

I'll be glad to start my new job and not have the fear of being found out in the back of my mind.

615	I tried to get revenge on a friend and put her in the hospital	I needed somewhere to say this because it has been eating at me for too long and i can't tell anyone in real life in fear of being arrested or something. My friend broke my trust by getting with my boyfriend but when I caught her I played it cool and acted like I didn't know then led her to my house and drugged her and beat her. I threw her in the woods and called the cops and she lives but was badly hurt.

616	I have been lying throughout my whole life but I can't seem to quit my ways.	I, (m17) have been lying ever since I've been born. I lied so I wouldn't get into trouble with moderate success. Due to my ethnicity I've been excluded and discriminated against by my peers up untill highschool. My habit of lying to get out of trouble spread to also be a way to socialise and to get friends, since I'm otherwise very socially inept. In truth I've done nothing with my life except waste it away behind the computer screen because there was nothing else for me to do. That turned into a way for me to cope with my errors. All social circles I've been a part of I have consistently been lying to in order to put me in the better position. Im currently in 2 social circles one is from college and the other is an online social circle. About 4 ish months ago I first spoke to this person that i genuinely cared for in my online circle. They're an amazingly kindhearted person and I have nothing but respect and compassion for them due to their behaviour even though the circumstances they live in are pretty bad. We chatted and I decided to keep them company for a while since even though they're a part of the same social circle I am, they're also struggling to feel connected with anyone. So over the months I lie about myself and suddenly I start feeling guilty. I made myself up to be this wonderful person and I feel awfull for doing so. To cope with that I have actually begun taking the steps to be more like how I describe myself. I began eating normally again, I am taking better care of myself than ever, before I couldn't have been bothered to help out anyone that needs it when I spot them but now I actively go out of my way to do so. With that being said, my guilt isn't going away. I still feel like an awful person for having lied about myself and made a false image about myself for people that I actually care about now. But I'm in a position where if I were to come out and tell the truth I'd definitely lose everything I have now, and it's precisely because I did find my people that I found the motivation to do anything. I know that there's almost always a way to be forgiven for your mistakes but I still don't forgive myself. The things I lied about are irredeemable and things have gotten so badly that I start believing my own lies. As an example I genuinely get upset when people makes jokes about stuff I previously lied about being sensitive over. I'm loosing my sense of self because I genuinely never had anything remarkable about myself and now I oh so desperately want to be the image I made others believe to be me. I don't fucking know what to do at this point, I know continuing to lie about myself in order to save my friendships is the selfish thing to do, my friend is still dependent on me and my social circle is the reason I'm finally beginning to somewhat improve on myself too.	18cfx24	i have been lying throughout my whole life but i cant seem to quit my ways	i m have been lying ever since ive been born i lied so i wouldnt get into trouble with moderate success due to my ethnicity ive been excluded and discriminated against by my peers up untill highschool my habit of lying to get out of trouble spread to also be a way to socialise and to get friends since im otherwise very socially inept in truth ive done nothing with my life except waste it away behind the computer screen because there was nothing else for me to do that turned into a way for me to cope with my errors all social circles ive been a part of i have consistently been lying to in order to put me in the better position im currently in  social circles one is from college and the other is an online social circle about  ish months ago i first spoke to this person that i genuinely cared for in my online circle theyre an amazingly kindhearted person and i have nothing but respect and compassion for them due to their behaviour even though the circumstances they live in are pretty bad we chatted and i decided to keep them company for a while since even though theyre a part of the same social circle i am theyre also struggling to feel connected with anyone so over the months i lie about myself and suddenly i start feeling guilty i made myself up to be this wonderful person and i feel awfull for doing so to cope with that i have actually begun taking the steps to be more like how i describe myself i began eating normally again i am taking better care of myself than ever before i couldnt have been bothered to help out anyone that needs it when i spot them but now i actively go out of my way to do so with that being said my guilt isnt going away i still feel like an awful person for having lied about myself and made a false image about myself for people that i actually care about now but im in a position where if i were to come out and tell the truth id definitely lose everything i have now and its precisely because i did find my people that i found the motivation to do anything i know that theres almost always a way to be forgiven for your mistakes but i still dont forgive myself the things i lied about are irredeemable and things have gotten so badly that i start believing my own lies as an example i genuinely get upset when people makes jokes about stuff i previously lied about being sensitive over im loosing my sense of self because i genuinely never had anything remarkable about myself and now i oh so desperately want to be the image i made others believe to be me i dont fucking know what to do at this point i know continuing to lie about myself in order to save my friendships is the selfish thing to do my friend is still dependent on me and my social circle is the reason im finally beginning to somewhat improve on myself too	cfx
617	Made extra money on deliveries by adding discounts to delivery orders at marcos pizza	"Saw a simmilar story, figured i would add mine. I was a teenager working at marcos pizza as a delivery driver. Online delivery orders would come in and I would notice that they didn't use a discount that we had. 

So I found this ""glitch"" out by mistake. We would run daily/weekly discounts and I saw that the customer had ordered two large specialty pizza's but did not receive the discount. So before delivery I decided to go up to the kiosk and update their order. I was hoping it would save them some money. 

I don't know why but I'm guessing because the transaction was already complete, the discount that I would apply just ended up in my bank at the end of the night. I didn't work there long (fired for forgetting a cheesy bread) but I made between 3 and 7 extra dollars per delivery every online order that didn't use the discounts we had. 

At first I thought I was stealing from marcos but then I realized that if I canceled the order and put it in correctly the customer would have been able to keep a few dollars. I do feel bad about stealing the money even if it was only a couple hundred total. Thanks for reading guys.

618	Wendys cash register money hack. We didn't get tipped, so we gave ourselves a tip!!	"When I was 15 I worked at Wendy's.  This was in the early 2000s and we were still using old style cash registers with a black screen and green letters.  

Anyway all of the prices were easy to remember and we would simply take orders and on easy ones we just wouldn't ring it up and pocket the money. 
 
You didn't want to make it too obvious so it was a secret between just a few of us employees.  I would close on Friday and Saturday nights and would always leave there with a 100 dollar tip every night!

619	I stole a fake pair of shoes from a car that was in an accident	"This summer, when I went to the sea, there was a car parked about 1km from my hotel that had been hit, probably in an accident. 

The rear window was broken and I saw a box in the trunk, I took it as I continued walking and when I got to the hotel I opened it, there were some fake shoes that I didn't need.

On the box was written the address they were for, so I left the box with the hotel owner telling him that I found it on the street and I want him to return it if he can, he said of course, he will do it.

620	I used to steal money from my grandma and spent it at school	"When I was in elementary- and middle school, my grandma used to beat me when I got home from school for no reason. I am autistic and didn't know how to express my emotions so I would have tantrums quite frequently and my parents nor my grandmother knew of nothing to console me. I would only have them at home because I was a mute child in school. 

After awhile, I would take money out of her wallet or anything I found around the house and spend it on candy at school. It became so bad that I stole $100 one time and I tried to spend it at the school book fair and my teacher had called my grandma. She was not happy, and she beat me for it. I stopped around my eighth grade year. 

My mother ended up moving into the house when I was 20. My grandma told her she could live there in hopes she would help fix the house for her (my grandma was living at my aunt's at the time). I creaked into one of the back rooms where all my grandmother's things were and I was looking for things from my childhood I thought I would like. This is where I found a ring my grandma told me I would have when I was grown up, and I took it. I also stole my great-grandmother's ring and a bunch of cameras that day as well. She never found out and I am 21 years old today.

622	I broke one of my bones on purpose to get out of going to school as a kid.	"When I (16M) was 9, I really, I mean REALLY hated school. I would do anything in my power to get a day off; fake sick days, faking a high temperature, fake vomit and so on. I got away with this for so many years, but people were catching on and getting suspicious.

We had a trampoline buried in the ground in our yard, and while I was on it one evening I had a thought; *if I broke a bone, then I can’t go to school for weeks*. I was jumping really high, thinking how to do it and I rotated my leg so I would land on my ankle and it would hit the metal frame and springs. 

I didn’t think it was possible to feel that level of pain. Not just my leg, but all through my body. 
I landed on the side of my ankle and my whole leg literally cracked. I don’t know how I didn’t do more damage than I did to be honest. 

Spent the whole night in hospital, and to my delight I was put in a full leg cast, thigh to ankle and sent home the next evening. 

Funnily enough, it didn’t even give me much time from school… I had one week of glorious breakfast in bed, video games and terrible daytime tv, and then I had to use crutches for weeks on end *at school* with people constantly trying to draw on my cast. 

I feel bad about this, I’ve never confessed and I don’t think I can now after so many years. I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea to blatantly hurt myself for this kind of thing. I’m almost worried for myself. I was *and still might be* a little bit psychotic.

Edit: people who are genuinely concerned for my welfare, I’m okay. I ended up being homeschooled about a year after this. I just had some awful teachers and the school actually ended up being shut down a while after I left. I am seeking therapy for non-related issues however.

623	i got into a car accident and immediately fled the scene	"i (16f), was pulling into a parking space at a grocery store a couple months ago and scraped against a sedan next to the spot i was trying to fit into. i was in shock because i had just gotten into another accident the day before. i promise i am not a reckless driver, the one before had been very minor, almost invisible damage as i judged the distance behind me while making a three point turn. i feel very guilty about leaving the scene of this accident, but i would have been in so much trouble if i got into two accidents in two days. the other car was empty, no one was hurt, the damage was probably very minor, so ultimately my therapist told me it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. it was wrong, however, and i acknowledge that. i never got caught, thank God. but i was so scared for weeks. just needed to get that off my chest.

edit: i mistyped. i am 16.

eta: i'm seeing my therapist because i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, major depression, adhd, and borderline personality disorder at the age of 15. at the time of this accident, i had just started a new stimulant medication at wayyy too high of a dosage the morning before (right before the first accident). that most likely explains the out of character erratic driving and why i impulsively fled, which was objectively stupid. i DO feel sorry, but there is nothing i can do now. even if i did confess, i have zero idea what the car even looked like (couldn't tell you the color), just the general size, or the exact date. i haven't had any close calls before those two days or since then. i'm not a victim, however i am not a totally shit person who goes out of her way to make everyone's days suck. the death threats are inappropriate. i appreciate the kind words and the people who reprimanded me in a constructive way. this was months ago.

Now my friend came up with the idea to steal from the mailbox, my friend also said that the person living was possibly dead which made this even more shittier, and then we stole the envelopes left from the mailbox, and then later look if there's was any money left In any of the envelopes, we didn't find any money and then later we either put it back in the mailbox or throw the envelopes away, I more leaning that we probably threw it away.

I tried to save it, but was in such bad condition that it just wasn't worth the effort anymore. I have already had bought a myself a better, newer one anyway.I've seen it a couple of times on marketplace, just going around between shady people trying to sell a trash car, but I haven't heard about it for about 9 months. However, a day ago it came up in the marketplace of the model's fb group. It was listed very close to my location.

And then something strange happened in my head, and did something unexplainable. I used my local knowledge and geoguessr skills, and identified the exact street. I still had one of the spare keys for some reason (the buyer did not care at all and as said I was sure its not gonna live longer), so i took it and drove there at 2:30am, completely empty streets. Turns out the newest owner didn't sell the parts but instead revived it. I took it for a 20 minute ride. It felt better than ever. Parked it and returned home. I genuinely think I will contact the seller tomorrow and rebuy it...

This is not something that I will ever tell anyone I know, as I am normally a 100% law abiding citizen, unlike many other ""car guys"" I respect the rules, speed limit all the time. Most people I know would probably freak out understandably, I can't even believe myself I did this nonsense.

I got stung by a bee eventually and stopped; I was a weirdly obsessed with bugs then, taking ants and making ant farms in empty water bottles and etc. but they always killed each other and young me was too asinine to find out.

I feel bad about it due to bees having a lot of emotional complexity (I learned that now.)"	188d1su	i used to stomp on bees and put worms in water bottles when i was little	"i used to stomp on random honey bees outside when i was a little kid and i put worms in water bottles to see what theyd do when i was a kid when i was told that they could live in water for some time

628	I made fake throw up to stay home from school when i was 11	"This isn’t some big juicy confession, just something I did that’s funny to me bc I just remembered it and have told NO ONE.  

When I was 11 I was going to this private school and hated it. Got bullied and all that shit. Anyway I literally would cry to my mom saying I didn’t wanna go and she let me stay home *a lot* but finally she said I couldn’t stay home anymore. So one night I decided to fake sick bc she wouldn’t just let me not go for no reason. Apparently faking like i got sick in the toilet and flushed it wasn’t believable enough soooo I had the idea to make my own 🙂.

 It was about 11 pm. Mom and dad were dead asleep. I went to the kitchen and remember getting milk, salsa, different kinds of chips, juice, and maybe some cheese or something. Anyway i crushed up the chips, mixed it all up in a bowl, and put it in the microwave for like 1 minute. 

I proceeded to my bedroom and POURED IT ALL ON THE CARPET. It didn’t smell as bad as actual throw up would. But i had to hurry so I put on my fake sick face and voice and went to my moms room. Told her. Made her come to my room to see the masterpiece, and she just looked at it with no reaction. She was genuinely unphased. She wasn’t comforting me like she usually would. She also has a very weak stomach and didn’t gag at all, just had no emotion. She said “okay clean this up and go back to bed”. And walked back to her room. I was lowkey disappointed bc thats rly how ur gonna act to my hard work?! 😭 lmao. 

Anyway, next morning she woke me up for school and I laid in bed until she came back again and said something like “do u remember i got sick last night? I still don’t feel good” and she literally just said “yea just stay home”. Nothing else. No “hope you feel better”, no “let me take your temp”, no “you’re going to the doctor” like usual. Thinking back on it she 100% knew it was fake and it’s lowkey embarrassing. Maybe she saw the effort and was like “ok she rly doesn’t wanna go”💀

To this day I have no idea what possessed me to make fake throw up… rly unnecessary. Anyway that’s all. Sorry if it was lame i just never told anyone"	1887z85	i made fake throw up to stay home from school when i was 	"this isnt some big juicy confession just something i did thats funny to me bc i just remembered it and have told no one

629	I stole 100 dollars from my parents so I could go on alot of rides at the fair.	When I was 12 my friend and I were going to the fair.

630	Physically hurting people and being hurt keeps me sane...	"I 17M have been bullied my entire life, however I often gaslight myself into thinking I didn't. Anyhow I use to get jumped alot even infront of my own girl who is now my ex was I was 15. But ever since I started kickboxing I feel I lost my sanity. I get violently angry If I don't hurt another person or see someone in pain. It feels like legal torture and its a drug like feeling I can't explain. And without it I feel useless, like a pen with no ink. I need to fight. I love the rush of feeling how much power a human can generate and I love seeing people in pain. 

It feels so normal and often comforting. I love hurting people and I've gone more and more extreme with it. I sometimes think how amazing it would be to torture someone. The rush would be incredible. I feel I will either be in a coma or in the news. I often watch hours of gore when ever im angry. It's soothing. And I know how edgey and corny I sound but I needed to get all of this off my chest.

631	I have been faking headaches for the past 10 years	When i was 6 i began getting headaches and naturally i enjoyed getting to stay home and sit in bed all day. But pretty soon the headaches went away. So i faked them, its pretty easy to fake one, just act a little annoyed and disconnected and maybe pretend to throw up. This became a habit and now alot of my medical history is a lie. My family thinks i have chronic migraines. Of course even though i have headaches every few months exedrin works just fine. Now i don’t want to fake my headaches so much for work i should be doing but its incessant. Maybe im just a impulsive liar. Should i come out to my family about the headaches or try to ease of them.	1877jl9	i have been faking headaches for the past  years	when i was  i began getting headaches and naturally i enjoyed getting to stay home and sit in bed all day but pretty soon the headaches went away so i faked them its pretty easy to fake one just act a little annoyed and disconnected and maybe pretend to throw up this became a habit and now alot of my medical history is a lie my family thinks i have chronic migraines of course even though i have headaches every few months exedrin works just fine now i dont want to fake my headaches so much for work i should be doing but its incessant maybe im just a impulsive liar should i come out to my family about the headaches or try to ease of them	jl
632	My mother has been facilitated for 2 years and I told people she was dead.	"EDIT: It took me a while to be able to face this post. I was definitely drunk and was overwhelmed and trying to find an outlet to expel. Thank you everyone.


I started taking care of my mother almost 9 years ago. I was adopted by my step grandmother.. through my grandfather who had adopted me, kiil8ng himself... to trying to help diagnose my deep depression... to being not okay with me contacting my birth mother... who had stayed in my life as a child as my grandfather's favorite. I feel like trash. I feel like i didnt do enough. Through my half sister that felt sickly disconnected and forgotten.. even though she was well taken care of... who crossed my boundaries about my relationship with OUR mother. Who hated me for not being more willing to subject her to the pain I had to endure alone. Being told by my birthmother it was easier to talk to my sister because she didn't have the terrible feel8ngs of loss about her... Losing my grandfather, my person.. losing my mother... his person... losing my sister.. my biological grandmother. Being told I was wrong for not reaching out. Taking care of my unrelated parent who was the only person I had... and having to decide to listen to shittalking or being an adult at 23 to take care of the person that continuously saved my life. To losing her. And my dog... to poor understanding from me about how detrimental it was getting. Losing my favorite job.. my soul, my mother, my worth.  And having to keep going alone.


I feel so defeated. I hadn't called her I a long while because seeing her at the window in my door saying she needed to leave to see her daughter injured me.. my mommy. Who helped me even in her diagnoses feel okay after being raped. Who held me even in her bad days, wanted to best the shit out of me because she thought I was a stranger.

I feel so lost. I feel so beaten. And all I want is mommy."	186j09w	my mother has been facilitated for  years and i told people she was dead	"edit it took me a while to be able to face this post i was definitely drunk and was overwhelmed and trying to find an outlet to expel thank you everyone

633	I did a hit and run with my mom's car against a parked car and have been lying about it for 5 years.	"I (23) was 18 and I was reversing out of a parking lot and I hit my mom's car into another car. I was with my ex. Both my mom's car and the other car had a huge dent. Huge. Almost like a hole. There were no other witnesses. We panicked. We did a hit and run.

I tried to get it fixed but it would cost me 50 bucks. I wasn't about to spend 50 bucks on my moms car. 

So we devised a plan. I told my mom that her car got hit by another car while I had it parked somewhere, and the perpetrator just left and didn't even leave a note! This way she wouldn't get mad because it wasn't my fault. She seemed to believe the story.

I still feel extremely guilty 5 years later. I try to convince myself that the story I made up is really true. That it wasn't my fault.

To this day my mom still very often jokes about how I crashed her car. She never got the car fixed. Every day we see the dent in her car. We laugh and I say it obviously wasn't my fault. She literally still jokes about it all the time. I know it's meant to be a joke, but I get the feeling that she actually never really believed my made-up story. But I never told her the truth for 5 years, ongoing.

I promised myself I would tell her after she got a new car. But that might be in like 10-15 years because the car was quite new at the time. I don't know how long my mom will keep her car. 

By that time I will be in my 30s and if I tell her then, I would have been lying to my mom for 15+ years. What if she disowns me? How could she forgive me for lying to her for that long? Maybe I should take it to the grave.

I don't know whose car we hit. I only remember it was a dark grey sedan. (Or maybe dark blue). It happened on a small island where everyone knows each other. I forgot to write down the number plate, I really wish I did. I hope they weren't that mad about the hole in their car.

634	I threw out my grandmother’s ashes and used the box to hide my drugs in	"Being the degenerate hedonist I was at 16, I needed a place to hide my dope and my pills. 

My parents were clever. It needed to be hidden very well. Some place they would never think to look.

I pick it up and notice the screws on the bottom. I fetch a screwdriver and crack open granny’s soon-to-be not-so-final resting place. 

There she was. Just a big plastic bag full of ashes.

She was a mean old bitch. Alcoholic, abusive, pathological liar. Nobody really missed her. Very few cried at her funeral, and I think most were just relieved that the old hag finally keeled over. 

I didn’t feel bad when I threw her ass in the garbage.

635	I've been wasting law enforcements time for years. Going back to at least 2015.	"From what I can tell it started back in 2014 to 2015. 
A couple things lead to this point, besides stupidity on law enforcements part. Firstly, I like to lie to people I don't like. On Facebook when I know someone is on my Facebook who likes to gossip, especially about me, I enjoy feeding them bullshit. So I just post insane nonsense. It's a weird joke nobody is in on but me. Alot of things I've said over the years would be concerning if you don't know me well, or people who aren't very smart.

Second I was big into paintball. I played decent roles in large events. Information being crucial to me in everything, I began looking into ""spy gadgets"", which I knew would get me put on a list. Because of that, I decided to make it into an unnecessary joke to see how much I can do before I get a fed knocking on my door. I began researching basically anything that I knew would be a red flag. Alot of things lead to a better understanding of things like thermodynamics and such, which I think is cool. More importantly, I enjoy trolling alot. To me, starting a battle of wits against the ""best and brightest"" for the sake of boredom is amusing. My main sense of amusement is misleading people in a particular manner where I drop hints that it's bullshit. I spent a lot of time over the years walking the line in so many ways just so I can reach the point where I am at today. 
Of particular note, law enforcement likes to play very dirty, something I should have anticipated, but I guess I had to high of an opinion of them than I should have. They've staged several ""crimes"" to blame on me, which is extremely disturbing. To be honest, I find it difficult to put into words my disgust towards Idaho law enforcement, and the awful crimes I've witnessed them conduct. 
Anywho, back to the point. Because my finely honed debauchery, they were under the impression that I was an easy target and are now trying to save face, which has been amusing. I don't think they have caught onto the fact that I have been messing with them for a long time. One day soon I will describe their steps including using women to get close to individuals of interest, and with gather information, and/or instigate. They are unaware as of yet that I know this. The process is quite interesting, but not particularly clever."	185a24c	ive been wasting law enforcements time for years going back to at least 	"from what i can tell it started back in  to

636	I started a bar fight, it became something way worse	When I was newly 21 I  was a serious feminist and also a hard core revenge fan. I had a lovely group of girlfriends who decided to take me out to a wildly popular dive bar in the city. I was so excited to be invited out with these gals as they were the hardest group of cliques I had ever encountered in my life and I just wanted in. Well, unfortunately the bar was huge and also so packed that evening we were shoulder to shoulder with each other. I kept getting my butt stroke, pinched and felt up at least 6x’s in the entire 45 period of time I had arrived. I knew it was from the obnoxious, ridiculously arrogant group of frat boys standing by our group. In fact, I slapped one dudes hand off my butt while he was in the midst of another grab. Since you had to scream, yea scream in order to have someone hear you and my so called friends were telling me to relax it’s no biggie i was furious. I wanted to fuck these dicks up and I wanted to start shit. So I thought it would be an interesting thing for me to see if I could get them to get their asses kicked by others. I knew I wouldn’t be able to do it myself so I decided to see if I could get some revenge and have someone else do it for me. I consciously made the decision to do this. The next hand was the last hand that was going to be touching my ass for that evening. So inevitably 15 minutes into the situation, I felt someone’s hand sliding down the back of my pants. I was not even aware of anything other than the rage that I felt about the situation and so I thought hey I’m gonna really do some thing about it this time and I did. I waited about 10 minutes and then I stepped on the biggest, ringleaders foot and gave him a push from behind, and it made it look like someone else to push them . Then I was like what the hell are you doing? Motherfucker, you can’t push people and get away with it and that’s when shit got real. I will never forgive myself to this day because I have no idea who I hurt, but I do know that I caused a lot of bad things to happen that evening. The only friend that I am still close with to this day and has no idea that I even began all of this rescued me as the entire scenario went so that shit crazy when we were racing away, they were literally 30 guys in the street and she started screaming. They have a gun. We were driving away. I was completely in denial of the situation. I have no idea whether or not anyone got hurt all I know is that because I thought it would be great to get revenge on a situation I let that loud the fact that I got a lot of people hurt. I do know that nothing is ever going to make me, forgive myself, but Jesus , it’s really crazy how violence can get out of hand. I. I think I went way too hard for this one. Not even my husband knows would happen. If I was to tell my one remaining friend that was able to save me from that evening, what I had done, she would never talk to me again and that would ruin me so I’m feeling like I have a huge bunch of karma coming my way and I’m just waiting it for Rent to happen 	1853b7l	i started a bar fight it became something way worse	when i was newly  i  was a serious feminist and also a hard core revenge fan i had a lovely group of girlfriends who decided to take me out to a wildly popular dive bar in the city i was so excited to be invited out with these gals as they were the hardest group of cliques i had ever encountered in my life and i just wanted in well unfortunately the bar was huge and also so packed that evening we were shoulder to shoulder with each other i kept getting my butt stroke pinched and felt up at least xs in the entire  period of time i had arrived i knew it was from the obnoxious ridiculously arrogant group of frat boys standing by our group in fact i slapped one dudes hand off my butt while he was in the midst of another grab since you had to scream yea scream in order to have someone hear you and my so called friends were telling me to relax its no biggie i was furious i wanted to fuck these dicks up and i wanted to start shit so i thought it would be an interesting thing for me to see if i could get them to get their asses kicked by others i knew i wouldnt be able to do it myself so i decided to see if i could get some revenge and have someone else do it for me i consciously made the decision to do this the next hand was the last hand that was going to be touching my ass for that evening so inevitably  minutes into the situation i felt someones hand sliding down the back of my pants i was not even aware of anything other than the rage that i felt about the situation and so i thought hey im gonna really do some thing about it this time and i did i waited about  minutes and then i stepped on the biggest ringleaders foot and gave him a push from behind and it made it look like someone else to push them  then i was like what the hell are you doing motherfucker you cant push people and get away with it and thats when shit got real i will never forgive myself to this day because i have no idea who i hurt but i do know that i caused a lot of bad things to happen that evening the only friend that i am still close with to this day and has no idea that i even began all of this rescued me as the entire scenario went so that shit crazy when we were racing away they were literally  guys in the street and she started screaming they have a gun we were driving away i was completely in denial of the situation i have no idea whether or not anyone got hurt all i know is that because i thought it would be great to get revenge on a situation i let that loud the fact that i got a lot of people hurt i do know that nothing is ever going to make me forgive myself but jesus  its really crazy how violence can get out of hand i i think i went way too hard for this one not even my husband knows would happen if i was to tell my one remaining friend that was able to save me from that evening what i had done she would never talk to me again and that would ruin me so im feeling like i have a huge bunch of karma coming my way and im just waiting it for rent to happen 	bl
637	When i was 8 or 9 i ;stole 600 EURO from my dad and my stepmother.	"I know the title sounds weird but here we are.

she was 11 at the time, well since i was like 8 i really didnt think much of spending money on roblox, i actually thought it was all free.

I think that my stepmother and my dad went to a dance or something so of course my at the time stepsister had to look out for me at home, we decided to play our favourite roblox game, ADOPT ME.

There was this adopt me hallowen update and my stepsister and i were obsessed´

Well and since i was 8 or 9 i really dont remember much but i do remember the spending. 

I think her mom \*at the time my stepmom´\* connected her card to her phone maybe because she needed something. and when my stepsister found out she told me that we can buy robux, i agreed because our parents wouldnt let us buy any robux.

We bought robux worth alone 600 EUROS and we also saved some for our avatars, we bought all the adopt me pets that were in the halloween update and we were like the happiest, until.

&#x200B;

Probably like 2 weeks after that they found out, and how.

&#x200B;

I was playing in the morning and i got scammed for my new pet, cerberus, the dog with 3 heads, i hope you know what i mean. Well of course i started crying and i went to the living room where my dad was watching the TV. He asked me what was wrong and i told him that i didnt want to tell him but i did in the end, i said that someone in a game took my ride pet that costs real life money. He tried to make me stop crying but the my stepsister and my stepmother came into the living room and she told my dad what happened.

&#x200B;

of course they were mad, who wouldnt be right.. 

they grounded us for about 3 months and took our phones, also dowloaded us family link and told us were will never play that game again. 

and i totally understand because they lost so much money because of us.

&#x200B;

\*do u think that i stole it or my sister did, maybe both too..

xb

probably like  weeks after that they found out and how

xb

i was playing in the morning and i got scammed for my new pet cerberus the dog with  heads i hope you know what i mean well of course i started crying and i went to the living room where my dad was watching the tv he asked me what was wrong and i told him that i didnt want to tell him but i did in the end i said that someone in a game took my ride pet that costs real life money he tried to make me stop crying but the my stepsister and my stepmother came into the living room and she told my dad what happened

xb

of course they were mad who wouldnt be right 

they grounded us for about  months and took our phones also dowloaded us family link and told us were will never play that game again 

and i totally understand because they lost so much money because of us

xb

do u think that i stole it or my sister did maybe both too

xb

ps they are no longer together

but it isnt because of the money that was longer ago"	uv
638	I have been stealing from KFC for more than 5 months now	"So I moved to Europe almost a year ago and was looking for a part time job as I am on work visa here and my actual job was starting in 2 months.
I got a job in a busy KFC store with a reference. I worked as BOH (cook) and got settled pretty quickly as everyone there was from Pakistan/India.
My manager lived in the same building as I did and he often brought me on his car when our timings matched.
I had a pixel 4 at that time and he had a iphone. One time on the commute, we were getting late and he wanted to log in (start shift) using his app but couldn’t because of some iphone error (as he said it). So he asked me to download the KFC employee app on android and sign-in to his account. I did and he logged in to start the shift on time. Lately I forgot about the app and never used it again.
5 months ago, I upgraded to pixel 7 and while transferring, I saw the app and his account was still logged in. I explored and found out everyone’s shift is available there. So I did what I had to do. I tried to change my previous shift and increased an hour there. And to my surprise, my next salary slip showed the extra hour. And then the next week, I added 7 hours and they appeared on my salary slip. So I made it a habit. I started adding hours on my shifts in previous week and nobody has ever said me anything. The manager has moved to another branch but I am still working here part-time. On weekends only but getting paid for 5 shifts every week.

I have started feeling bad about this very recently and will stop from now on. I am planning on how to admit this to my manager without getting in trouble as I am on work visa and this could backfire a lot."	184u9cp	i have been stealing from kfc for more than  months now	"so i moved to europe almost a year ago and was looking for a part time job as i am on work visa here and my actual job was starting in  months

639	I got off breaking girls hearts and I regret it to this day	"So between the ages of 18-23, I would get as many girls as I could.  I was texting them all that I loved them and playing with their emotions. Long talks on phone and texts. Sexual with many. I'd go from one to another to another daily. I'd make promises of a future and throw the ""I love you"" out there to all. All in all it was maybe 250-300 different people.

640	Theft of a large amount from a national corporation	"Back in the early to mid 90’s (yes last century) I had a shopping cart full of stuff from a large retailer, let’s call them SlawMart. The store wasn’t terribly busy, and I bought all the slaw, about 450.00 in 1990s money… went through the checkout, and realized I’d forgotten my checkbook at home (the old days lol).
The kind hearted cashier suspended the transaction and said I could go home, get the checkbook and just come back through the line with the suspended receipt to finish up paying. I was like, “cool”. So I rolled the bagged cart to the service desk area, parked it and told them what had happened and that I’d be back… thru were like, “cool”.
When I returned I noticed the store was quite a bit busier, rush hour I guess, and I went back to service, waved my checkbook at them, they waved back and I headed to the now very busy cashier, but had to go towards the SlawGreeter area to get back to where the lines started. So with a very long suspended receipt in hand I …walked out the door.

I got away with it because I was a twenty-something year old white woman in the south, decently dressed, decent looking and confident with a long receipt in hand. That’s the good’ole USA truth, even if I didn’t realize it at the time.

However, my heart didn’t stop pounding for several years.

641	When I was nine I stole 700$ from my mom, and never got caught.	"When I was nine, I really wanted to a certain item on roblox, which would require me to spend a shit load on it's currency. Not that long ago, it was my birthday, and for my birthday I wanted robux. My mom must have accidently saved her card on my tablet, because her credit card was like a default option, you just needed your tablet password, (which of course I knew.) Roblox didn't require so social security or phone number or any actual details, it just required the card number. So I went on a spending spree, I bought 70k robux, and bought the item I really wanted.

My mom found out she lost 700 dollars to a game called ""Roadblocks"" she called it. Anyways though my mom reported her card got stolen, she never got the money back and I kept all of my items. Me and five of my siblings play the game so they never knew it was me. I am fifteen now and still feel guilty to this day, but I promise to myself when I get a job I will repay her. (We barely got by that month, generally don't know how we survived.) And it is completely useless now because I haven't played the game in two years."	184nm5u	when i was nine i stole  from my mom and never got caught	"when i was nine i really wanted to a certain item on roblox which would require me to spend a shit load on its currency not that long ago it was my birthday and for my birthday i wanted robux my mom must have accidently saved her card on my tablet because her credit card was like a default option you just needed your tablet password which of course i knew roblox didnt require so social security or phone number or any actual details it just required the card number so i went on a spending spree i bought k robux and bought the item i really wanted

643	I accused my elementary school teacher of inappropriate behavior.	"My mother was in a relationship with a man that lasted up until I was around thirteen years old. Needless to say, it was sometimes emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. I was often being cursed out, forced beatings that were apparently “needed” that lasted in 3-4 intervals, force fed food, and being locked in my room only to come out unless I needed to use the bathroom or eat. I think the worst was when I was with her boyfriend, and he threatened to kill me and him often If I didn’t say that my mom wanted to get back with him. He even at one point set half the house on fire on purpose, lied and said he didn’t, because he was mad at her. She stayed during all of this.

Sometimes, it was okay, even good. However, when she or her boyfriend got mad at me, I was punished beyond relief. I didn’t really build any confidence or likening to myself, therefore I just constantly acted out in school. Which made the punishments worse. 

I had a elementary school teacher, who, for the first time was actually nice to me. He would commemorate on everything I did, hold me on his lap and talk to me, and smile at me. I wasn’t really getting that positive attention. I began to like crave it, almost. Until, when I realized the distinction between him and at home, I was both angry and upset my mom wasn’t giving it to me. I basically went home one day, and told my mother and her boyfriend what he was doing, and when asked if it was inappropriate, and in a very subtle way, egged by my moms boyfriend to say it was not appropriate, they called one of my relatives who essentially worked to get him fired. She kind of just told him he couldn’t work at the school anymore or something. He didn’t come back but he became the principal at another school. 

I was around 8 when this happened. Yes, I do know this was a terrible thing. I feel horrible about it. The only way I feel some relief is knowing that no charges were pressed against him and he had another job almost immediately."	183rwfd	i accused my elementary school teacher of inappropriate behavior	"my mother was in a relationship with a man that lasted up until i was around thirteen years old needless to say it was sometimes emotionally and sometimes physically abusive i was often being cursed out forced beatings that were apparently needed that lasted in  intervals force fed food and being locked in my room only to come out unless i needed to use the bathroom or eat i think the worst was when i was with her boyfriend and he threatened to kill me and him often if i didnt say that my mom wanted to get back with him he even at one point set half the house on fire on purpose lied and said he didnt because he was mad at her she stayed during all of this

644	I threw away a customers phone for leaving a huge mess	Throw back to being 19 at my first job working fast food. It was the busiest store in the district with the most sales and I was in charge of the dinner and taking the orders for all the customers. Wasn't allowed to clean while there were orders to take but I had to be sure that the dinner and bathrooms were clean and the the trash was taken out by the end of the day. So, one day this group of teens like my age or maybe a bit younger came in, kinda sat in the back out of view and proceeded to leave all of their trash on the table despite the trash can being only a few feet away in addition to getting sauses and chili all over the table. Unfortunately for them, one of them left their phone on the table. So I did what any good employee would do. I cleaned the table; throwing everything on it away. Later the teen that couldn't find his phone came back and asked if I'd seen a phone. I straight faced told him no and we stared at each other for a moment. I get the feeling that the gears were turned and maybe he'd remembered the mess they left and kinda put 2 and 2 together but regardless after that little stare down he just walked out and I never saw him again. Idk but it felt like justice to me in the moment.	183nrxa	i threw away a customers phone for leaving a huge mess	throw back to being  at my first job working fast food it was the busiest store in the district with the most sales and i was in charge of the dinner and taking the orders for all the customers wasnt allowed to clean while there were orders to take but i had to be sure that the dinner and bathrooms were clean and the the trash was taken out by the end of the day so one day this group of teens like my age or maybe a bit younger came in kinda sat in the back out of view and proceeded to leave all of their trash on the table despite the trash can being only a few feet away in addition to getting sauses and chili all over the table unfortunately for them one of them left their phone on the table so i did what any good employee would do i cleaned the table throwing everything on it away later the teen that couldnt find his phone came back and asked if id seen a phone i straight faced told him no and we stared at each other for a moment i get the feeling that the gears were turned and maybe hed remembered the mess they left and kinda put  and  together but regardless after that little stare down he just walked out and i never saw him again idk but it felt like justice to me in the moment	nrxa
645	I cut my hair, blamed it on another child got him in trouble	"Yeah, as the title says. 
When I was about 5/6, I heard my mum talking about me needing a hair cut. 

During school we had access to scissors. In my kid mind, I thought I would be saving my mum time by cutting it. So I sat in a corner when the teacher was busy and started cutting my hair. Which was tied back.

1 child spotted me doing it and sat and watched me. Told me i shouldn't be doing it etc. 

Later on when I was at home, my mum took the bobble(hair tie) out of my hair and noticed that my hair had been cut.

In panic of my mums reaction, I told her it was the boy (whose name was a male version of my name - kinda like daniel/danielle) who had cut my hair. **ETA** I blamed the boy who had watched me

The following day, my mum reported it to the school, his mum got called into school and he got in trouble. Even more trouble for lying when he denied it. His mum had to pay for a hairdresser to fix my hair. 

The kicker is, I was believed because I was such a rule follower in school, I kept my head down and worked, telling the teachers if a pupil was misbehaving etc. 

This boy was in trouble all through school and he has spent time in and out of prison, has had drug issues etc.  

I do wonder if that 1 incident of him telling the truth and not being believed was the start of all his issues. 

I heard my mum talking about the above a few years back and I tried to come clean and tell her the truth and she didn't believe me!! Oh the irony!

646	I used to steal erasers from kindergarten as a young kid... this was the time when i truly had a lesson about consequences of theft	"When i was a young boy around the age of 5, i had a tendency to steal erasers from my friends and teachers in kindergarten and used to bring it home to show my parents and cousins. They would ask how i acquired these and i would respond with ""i took it from kindergarten"" and they would tell me to give it back and that doing that is bad but my stupid young self did not know the consequences of stealing. So then i continued to do it.

this habit continued for almost a year until finally people started becoming suspicious and the teachers started searching everyone's bag one by one. i vividly remembered that moment of panic i had as i didn't know what to do and eventually i tried to hide it in my pockets but then a sudden urge of guilt struck me and seconds later... everyone was staring at me then my classroom teacher called in the other teachers into the room and then i started to cry VERY loudly... i then was forgiven by them but i had to promise never to do it again and return them.

To this day i still regret and carry that guilt in my head and now that i look back at it, i understood it was completely my fault although it was only erasers.

647	I once gave a customer food that fell on the floor	"I was about 18 and working at a fast food restaurant. That day, it was just myself and my manager working because it was really quiet when I worked. Sometimes my manager would go into their office and not come out for a while unlsss it was busy, and those times I would take orders, make them and give them to the customer.

It was quiet and usual (as in no customers at all) when one day this guy comes in and he orders 6 salt and pepper prawns. He was kinda rude to me, but I was used to it and ignored it. I took his order and went to the kitchen to make his food. The prawns used to take 1 minute 45 seconds to cook. It’s not long at all, but this guy seemed to be huffing and puffing at how long it took while the prawns were in the fryer. Mind you, there was a big window between the counter and kitchen so you could see exactly what was happening if you were a customer.

Eventually they finish cooking and to save time, I used to shake the prawns directly into the box from the fryer basket. And of course, one fell onto the floor. I looked at the customer to see if he noticed but he wasn’t paying attention and my manager was nowhere to be seen. I didn’t wanna have to tell him it would be another 2 minutes because I could tell he would complain about it and I didn’t want to deal with that.

So I quickly grabbed a pair of tongs and picked the prawn up from the floor, dipped it in the fryer for 10 seconds or so, put it in the box and gave it to the customer. He said thank you and left.

I could see him through the window happily snacking on his prawns and still feel guilty about it to this day, 12 years later."	183b67o	i once gave a customer food that fell on the floor	"i was about  and working at a fast food restaurant that day it was just myself and my manager working because it was really quiet when i worked sometimes my manager would go into their office and not come out for a while unlsss it was busy and those times i would take orders make them and give them to the customer

648	I tricked mentally ill and poor people into doing degrading stuff on camera.	"Exactly as the title says. A couple of years ago, I was heavily into cocaine, so my friends and I would stay up all night just talking to each other in my apartment for many nights in a row. Most people who have done a lot of drugs know that playing video games and watching movies is really not that fun to do while snorting lines all night. So we started doing a lot of weird things (like this) instead.One night, for some reason we started messing with this mentally ill guy who we went to school with on facebook who thinks he died when he crashed his car on ecstasy a couple of years back and got a major psychosis from the incident. The guy now fully believes he is dead and makes these weird Facebook rants, telling people he is seeing and talking to angels and demons and that he is dead. One night, we call up the guy, posing as a local newspaper that wants to write an article about him. He and my friend had the strangest conversation ever! He kept the conversation going for almost two hours, while I recorded the whole thing as an MP3 on my phone.

The next day, I presented the clip to all of my friends, who were totally ecstatic, and we all think it's the funniest thing we have ever heard. We start messing with this guy almost every night after work (writing him as god, making him record weird songs from ""heaven"" and ""hell"", making him take weird photos of himself, etc.), but after a week of shenanigans, his caretaker or whoever makes him delete his Facebook account because the rants online are getting out of control.

After realizing that messing with this guy was funny as shit but that we could no longer do it, we started looking for new victims. First, we start trolling our local high school's facebook group posing as this pair of fucked up parents, but are eventually found out and kicked. Then we start trolling the local vegans selling horse meat and other stuff, but eventually they make the group private and only members they know personally can join. After that, we started trolling all sorts of local groups on Facebook.

To join these local groups, you have to have an account that looks somewhat believable, so we would go on these religious boards and make posts praising god (that shit gets a lot of activity) and just start adding people until we had a ton of friends and the account would look somewhat real. The people most active on these religious boards are people from places in Africa that are very poor. And these people are willing to do anything for a couple of bucks, so we start calling up random strangers that look like they are willing to do anything for money, sending them a bit of cash via Western-Union to make them try and do backflips while I record it.

The crazy part is that once you send that first dollar, they know that there is more where it's coming from, and you now have your own personal jester overseas. And they will do literally ANYTHING as long as you send them that first bit of cash.

So then it became almost like a new addiction for me. I was promising these poor people a big cash prize (of course, there was no prize) if they did what I told them to do on the webcam, so I could record it. The most fucked up part is that I enjoyed doing it and found it hilarious. I used to only do it with friends so we could all laugh at it together, but later I often just sat alone, calling/writing these poor people and making them do weird and degrading stuff on webcam. :("	1838bhq	i tricked mentally ill and poor people into doing degrading stuff on camera	"exactly as the title says a couple of years ago i was heavily into cocaine so my friends and i would stay up all night just talking to each other in my apartment for many nights in a row most people who have done a lot of drugs know that playing video games and watching movies is really not that fun to do while snorting lines all night so we started doing a lot of weird things like this insteadone night for some reason we started messing with this mentally ill guy who we went to school with on facebook who thinks he died when he crashed his car on ecstasy a couple of years back and got a major psychosis from the incident the guy now fully believes he is dead and makes these weird facebook rants telling people he is seeing and talking to angels and demons and that he is dead one night we call up the guy posing as a local newspaper that wants to write an article about him he and my friend had the strangest conversation ever he kept the conversation going for almost two hours while i recorded the whole thing as an mp on my phone

649	I never gave a customer their change back and lied to my manager about it	"At my first ever job, I was working in a drive thru coffee shop as a teenager (15) and had gotten used to people paying in exact change. This guy comes through the drive thru and hands me a wad of coins, my brilliant self didn't even count it and threw it into the register, thinking he paid in exact change. I walked away and the other worker gave him his coffee. The customer proceeds to yell through the window asking where his change is, pointing at me. He makes a pretty big commotion causing my manager to come out and ask what was going on, I was so embarrassed I lied and said he gave me exact change. My manager backed me and told him to continue along and stop harassing me. He ended up driving away.

I have no clue how much he gave me, I still feel so bad and i can remember his face clearly. Now that I'm older (and wiser, thankfully), I know how important even a dollar can be for someone. Such a stupid thing to do. I got fired from that job, which was warranted.

650	I stole a lot of little things from my elementary school	"I know this doesn't feel like a big deal. But I feel really bad even now that I'm older.

When I was in elementary school, I was a mean child. I never bullied anyone but I was selfish and liked to stir up trouble. 

When I was in kindergarten, I drew a picture of a bunny. I based the drawing off of a little model bunny. He was small and realistic. The drawing was so good that I made it to a local art collection. It only stayed their for a week or so but I was proud of it. It was the one time that I got my parents attention. Anyway, the next year in first grade we were drawing animals again. I wanted the little bunny again since I did a good job the first time. Unfortunately a little girl took it before me. In an act of pettiness, I stole the little bunny so I could keep it. I didn't want the little girl to draw a better bunny then me 😂. I felt really bad right after especially when the little girl cried because she thought she lost it. But at least she didn't draw a better bunny than me. 

I also once stole a book from my second grade class (I know, how mischievous).  It was a book about prehistoric animals. And I really liked it. Instead of asking my parents to buy it, I stole it. I coved the teacher's name with stickers so nobody could tell. 

My and one of my friends also stole a piece of toast from breakfast every day. Our cafeteria had these really good pieces of toast in the morning, but they always had a 'take one' sign. We didn't like that. We found a way to position the toast under another piece. We took two every day and never got caught. 

I stole a calculator from one of my other friends. I asked to borrow it on the last day of school and forgot to give it back to her. I actually forgot. I don't think she remembers I took it.

I stole a lot of other smaller things like Legos from the Lego club I joined. But I'm not going to list them all.
After I graduated elementary school, I never stole anything from someone else again (besides cookies from the pantry and stuff from my sister lol). I've never told anyone else about all this stuff and it's kinda nice to get it off my back. I still remember all this which goes to show that you never really forget it, even years later. I still feel bad for these little things. Even though they were small."	182gav6	i stole a lot of little things from my elementary school	"i know this doesnt feel like a big deal but i feel really bad even now that im older

651	i screenshotted a nude when i was young and i regret it	when i was 14 a girl sent me a nude and i screenshotted it. she also showed me her breast on a video call and i tried to record it without her consent. i regret it heavily now and i deleted them both immediately after. i thought it was ok because people would always talk about taking screenshots secretly and that it was a common thing. i didnt do it to blackmail her, i did it because i thought it was hot.	181nff4	i screenshotted a nude when i was young and i regret it	when i was  a girl sent me a nude and i screenshotted it she also showed me her breast on a video call and i tried to record it without her consent i regret it heavily now and i deleted them both immediately after i thought it was ok because people would always talk about taking screenshots secretly and that it was a common thing i didnt do it to blackmail her i did it because i thought it was hot	nff
652	i lied about having cancer in elementary school then ended up actually having it later on	"i used to lie for fun as a child, partly because of a lack of attention from my parents but mainly because i just enjoyed it. it started with little ones such as my favorite color, having certain pets/siblings, etc. then one day it escalated to me lying about having certain illnesses and disorders. i didn't have any bad intentions, it was just a hobby to me and fun to see how far i could go with people's trust. 
however, what i didn't expect was for the few kids i told about having cancer to, to then tell their parents, and then the staff. they wanted to start a fundraiser for me, they wanted to start hanging up posters in the hallways with my school picture on it and a short paragraph saying i was suffering from ovarian cancer: all within one week. i was absolutely mortified. this went on for a few more days until my mom was phoned by another parent/friend, expressing their sympathy for her child's illness. i remember that day VIVIDLY. i was in the kitchen and she was in the basement, i heard her pick up the phone then shortly yell my name. i walked over to the steps and she asked if i told people i had cancer and i panicked. my mind at that point was so trained at making up lies i immediately told her that there was another girl with the same name that had cancer in my grade, and that we must have gotten confused. i heard her explain this to the mother on the phone and sighed of relief when she said ""that poor girl"" in reference to this ""other girl with my name that had cancer"". 
the next day i went into school and was confronted by the guidance counselor, who asked to speak with me. long story short, the other girl's mom was notified by a close friend and it all came circling back to me. she explained the boy who cried wolf and how lying can really hurt people. i came up with stupid excuses as a child does but what i would never expect is being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in college. seems like too much of a coincidence to me, i believe it's karma. so does my mom. shortly after that i was also diagnosed with a brain tumor, which seems like a cherry on top of the already deserved parfait of pay-back. 
anyways, i've since mended my ways and am in remission. i still talk to the ""other girl"" every once in a while-we created a weird sort of friendship after everything died down."	181hhbt	i lied about having cancer in elementary school then ended up actually having it later on	"i used to lie for fun as a child partly because of a lack of attention from my parents but mainly because i just enjoyed it it started with little ones such as my favorite color having certain petssiblings etc then one day it escalated to me lying about having certain illnesses and disorders i didnt have any bad intentions it was just a hobby to me and fun to see how far i could go with peoples trust

653	I have a tendency to purposely damange products at work	"I work as a technician at an automated storehouse and I'm hired in a company that delivered the automated facility. The company that owns the warehouse is a different company, but we work closely together. We do maintenance on the machinery and ensure that everything is running 24/7, while the company that owns the facility hire people to drive forklifts, pick products, refill machines etc.

Products are loaded on to conveyors and are sent in to the warehouse. The people doing this job are supposed to ensure that the pallets and products fit the criteria, like removing straps, plastics, checking dimentions and stability of the boxes/products on the pallets etc. When the pallets coming in are crooked, they often fall over easily. Most of the time its the forklift drivers fault, which annoy me and my colleagues a lot. It's now we, the technicians job to get the machines up and going again. One time I fixed up a pallet, and of pure anger I kicked the hell out of it and ruined products. Sent the pallet to the station for broken pallets knowing some dude there has to fix it. 

Other times I have pulled out completely fine products that have fallen on the ground inside a machine, and again I kicked the product in to the wall, it was a packet full of rice, now there was rice everywhere and it fell through the holes in the floor down to the machinery below. I just left it.

Its not rare that products are damaged in the facility, so none of this is ever questioned, and I haven't done this many times at all, but I still did it.
I dont know where my anger comes from or if its just pure boredom. I also sometimes get the urge to just throw stuff, but I resist it every time. I don't know why I feel this way but I know I shouldn't be doing it. I just felt like i needed to get this off my chest."	180xpro	i have a tendency to purposely damange products at work	"i work as a technician at an automated storehouse and im hired in a company that delivered the automated facility the company that owns the warehouse is a different company but we work closely together we do maintenance on the machinery and ensure that everything is running  while the company that owns the facility hire people to drive forklifts pick products refill machines etc

654	As a child I stole cigarettes from a lady I cleaned for	"My parents were always big on the whole “teaching them how to work before they have to actually have a job” so I started cleaning for this older woman and her husband when I was probably about 13. My mom knew the woman/was friends with her, and they lived right down the road from us (maybe 1/4 mile, probably less)((I could walk there in less than 5 minutes)). Anyhow she has this beautiful super old Victorian house and she’s just too old to keep up with all of the cleaning so she hired me for like 20$ a week or something to come once a week and she gave me a list of things that I could clean in a few hours. More times than not I would finish cleaning and end up just sitting there talking to her or listening to her tell stories or give life advice (she was awesome and adorably funny) 

I got completely side tracked, point of the story is her husband smoked camels and I was a curious little gremlin about smoking and whatnot. And a couple of times I took a cigarette out of his pack that he kept on top of their China cabinet in the kitchen and would smuggle it back the couple minute walk home and would climb out onto the porch roof outside my bedroom window at night and would try to smoke while everyone was asleep. That’s how I tried my first cigarette, and it was terrible and I hated it and I’m still amazed how I never had gotten caught by neither the old lady or my parents."	180rmhh	as a child i stole cigarettes from a lady i cleaned for	"my parents were always big on the whole teaching them how to work before they have to actually have a job so i started cleaning for this older woman and her husband when i was probably about  my mom knew the womanwas friends with her and they lived right down the road from us maybe  mile probably lessi could walk there in less than  minutes anyhow she has this beautiful super old victorian house and shes just too old to keep up with all of the cleaning so she hired me for like  a week or something to come once a week and she gave me a list of things that i could clean in a few hours more times than not i would finish cleaning and end up just sitting there talking to her or listening to her tell stories or give life advice she was awesome and adorably funny

655	I threw a rock at someone for sitting next to my best friend	"Once when I was 9, I was late to go outside for recess (I believe I was in the bathroom, if I recall correctly).  
  
Usually, my best friend (whom I'm now married to) and I were practically attached at the hip at recess, but because I was late to go outside and she was ushered out with the rest of our class, she was outside playing already.  
  
When I went outside, she was sitting with her back to the door of the school in a pile of leaves, and another boy in our class was sitting very close to her.  
  
In a somewhat concerning display of jealousy, I picked up a rock and pelted it right at the back of his head. He didn't know who'd thrown it, and he ended up telling the teacher.

Every Friday in June my school sold popsicles out front of the office. This was to help fund school trips and stuff like that. I swiftly volunteered to selflessly (/s) give up my recess to sell popsicles. 

Every few customers, I would slip a loonie up my hoodie sleeve. Soon enough I had a rattling sleeve of coins. I excused myself and dumped it into my backpack. 

2 hours later I was at the movies with my classmates, munching on $15 worth of my favourite candies, and of course the popcorn I was originally supposed to buy. 

Nobody ever found out as far as I know, I never got in trouble.

658	I talk behind people’s back and cause drama due to childhood trauma.	"As a young kid I was excessively walking on eggshells and it constantly felt like everything was my fault. Because of this when I’m confronted with a problem I tend to act inauthentic towards it. It’s easy to pretend rather than deal with possibly being yelled at. To get this negativity out I will talk bad about the person behind their back as it helps me keep my emotions in balance without feeling like it’s my fault. I get loads of validation of people being like “yeah I hate this person too!” Or “yes they are such a weirdo” and I instantly feel joy. However I don’t realize the destruction of this ‘mean girl’ behavior. Before you know it I’m the Regina George and the entire place is going nuts. I wish I could change.

Edit: I went to therapy a year ago and it did not help. My therapist was very backhanded. Any other suggestions would be great without being snooty or rude.

Edit 2: To those who asked, I prefer the validation over the ‘gossip’ if you wanna call it that. I am by no means saying my behavior is warranted either.  I’m also not okay with being referred to as ‘girl’ or ‘boy’. I should’ve said this earlier though.

Edit 3 and 4: I wasn’t sure about admitting this happening to me cuz it happened just a few days after my second edit but i’m sure you guys would love to know. I got punched, but it was coming and I’m not good with physical altercations hence why I talked behind people’s back, you guys warned me. I will say that I learned a valuable lesson and that’s never to talk behind someone’s back.

659	Stealing money to sustain my image and her lifestyle	"Back in college, I had a stable part time job for quite a while and hence I had a pretty decent credit score for a college student.  I was driving a nice luxury car but it was just a used car bought with a car loan...it was a somewhat irresponsible car loan but not outrageous.  I also had several gold credit cards that lined my wallet (because my credit score was good enough that banks would issue me gold cards.  So, once in a while, some friends would be amazed that I had multiple gold credit cards when I took out my wallet to pay for something.   
  
The reality is that my part time job, even though very stable, only pays enough for me to get by, but certainly not to live a luxurious student life.  I had a girlfriend who was somewhat materialistic.  And up to this date, I still believe that one reason that she was with me was because she thought I was ""rich enough""...or my family was rich.  
  
Anyway, when we moved in together to a higher end apartment, she thought we were living a good life...relative to most other students.  The secret was that she didn't know my salary from my part time job was impossible to sustain in the long run the higher rents as well as all the entertainment expenses that she wanted to have.    
  
Once every 2 or 3 months, I would end up short on money.  In the hindsight, I was smart enough NOT to load up on my credit cards even when I was trying to keep up with the false image that I created for myself.  So, what did I do when I was short on cash and I didn't use my credit cards???  This is where my confession and regret are.  
  
My then live-in gf's family is actually quite well off.  And they always kept her bank account with a fairly high cash balance.  Most times, she didn't even have an exact idea of how much cash she has in her bank account.  Since she thought that I was rich, she trusted me with her bank account.  Once in a while when she was too lazy to make a bank run, she'd ask me to withdraw some spending cash (for herself) from her own bank account by giving me her ATM card and the pin. I always made the withdraw for her and I would give her the cash and the printed receipt so that she could see that I withdrew exactly what she asked.    
  
During the month that I knew I was about to be short for rents or car payments, I'd find good opportunities such as when she was taking a long afternoon nap or she slept in on a weekend morning from partying the night before, I took her ATM card from her purse and went to withdraw a few hundred dollars from her bank account.  
  
At that time, I justified it by telling myself that she didn't pay rents or food when we lived together. Still, deep down inside me, I knew I was stealing from her. Period. I stole from her bank account, on the average, about once every 2 to 3 months during the 2 years that we lived together.  I was smart enough (or calculating enough) not to be too greedy and I always only took what was necessary at the time. Never more than necessary.  And that practice kept the stolen amount low, with respect to her bank account balance, and that was the key of never drawing any suspicion from her.  
  
After I graduated and got a pretty good paying job, I no longer needed to steal money from her bank account.  The irony was that she eventually still left me to be with a much older guy, a financially well off guy."	17xzfj4	stealing money to sustain my image and her lifestyle	"back in college i had a stable part time job for quite a while and hence i had a pretty decent credit score for a college student  i was driving a nice luxury car but it was just a used car bought with a car loanit was a somewhat irresponsible car loan but not outrageous  i also had several gold credit cards that lined my wallet because my credit score was good enough that banks would issue me gold cards  so once in a while some friends would be amazed that i had multiple gold credit cards when i took out my wallet to pay for something

660	Made a very bad joke back in high school and I regret it.	"Took an Oreo, split it in half, used the half with the cream to clean up pee drops from a toilet bowl from the boys bathroom, closed the Oreo and gave it to this classmate who ate it.

661	I drowned a spider because it was convenient for me	"Saw a spider in my kitchen sink. Thought about taking it out to the nearest window but had no way to trap it and had to think fast because it was trying to climb out the sink, and would've lost track of it

662	i lit something on fire in the middle of class and nobody else noticed	"i was sitting at a table during class with three other people who are complete strangers.
i had a gum wrapper and two batteries, i set the batteries side by side on the foil side of the gum wrapper, i didn’t think it would spontaneously combust in like a second, i swatted the wrapper onto the floor and stepped on it. not long after, the teacher walked over to the front of the class and said that it smelt burnt up there. the three other people i sat with played it off that it was the welding class, but some random kid said it was first period so we played it off like it was our  bags. after the teacher walked back to their desk i picked up the burnt remains of the gum wrapper and left class, and nobody suspected me at all."	17w8rfg	i lit something on fire in the middle of class and nobody else noticed	"i was sitting at a table during class with three other people who are complete strangers

663	Me And My Friend Started A Fire Behind My School...	"Okay, In 2016 or 2017 Me, My Friend, And My Siblings would always go to a place we called ""The Dirt Hill"" and we would do random things there like dig 6 foot deep holes and make stuff out of scrap wood, 

One Day When We Got There My Sister Had an Idea To Start a Bon Fire, So We Did Just That We Gathered Some Rocks And Put Them Around In A Circle, we got some wood And Then We Where Ready To Start The Fire Me And My Brother Got The Matches and then we started The Fire, (keep  In Mind This Dirt Hill Was In A Feild With A LOT of Weeds)

 Everything Was Going Well We Were Getting More Wood For The Fire To Burn Longer, but when we went to get some more wood and we came back And The Fire ""Somehow"" Got Out Of The Circle And Started Spreading QUICK,

 We Where All Trying To Stop The Fire i was throwing sand on the fire but it was not working Then My Brother Had The Bright Idea To Put A Haybale On The Fire To Stop It So He Did It, then the fire stopped... But Then Quickly Came Back, But NOW The Fire Was like 20x Bigger, Half Of The Field Was On Fire, 

We Went To Our Neighbors House And Asked Them To Call 911 And To Use Her Hose To Try To Stop The Fire but it did not work, the fire was just getting bigger and Bigger, Finaly After A Litteral Minute Of Waiting The Fire Trucks Where There And They Took Out The Fire, 

We Were All Scared about what our parents would think, They Where Mad At Us, for a Few Months The Field Was Black and burnt.

664	I lost a note book at school that would get me into so much trouble about 6-7 years ago	"It was a diary but I’d only used the first few pages before I lost it. I was so angry at my step dad I wrote all the horrible things he did and wrote a help note in there with my mums number, my address and full name. I wrote how I wished someone could just come rescue me and get me away from this house and how he’s a danger to society, not literally but it definitely came across that way. I was maybe 13 when I did this. 

I don’t know why I did this. So embarrassing.

665	I hid my aunts cigarettes and everybody still blames my sister for it	"Im the youngest of 3 siblings, all girls. We were having a sleepover at my cousins who is about my middle sisters age, it was all going good until I had to use the toilet, it was approaching night time and we were getting ready for bed when I went to use the toilet. So.. I was doing my business (keep in mind I was about 9 years old) when I saw some cigarettes on the floor. I didn't know what it was but i saw something that said toxic on it so my natural defence I was like, oh let me hide it, cause its bad. So I put it into this pot in the bathroom and left. Few minutes after, my aunt walked in to the bathroom for a smoke but she couldn't find her cigarettes, and she yelled and shouted, accusing everyone. I stayed silent. I was scared. So I was like, let me go in the bathroom and put them back where they were, so I did. She checked the bathroom again and found her cigarettes and she was like hold on who took them, she ultimately ended up accusing my older sister of it and its a secret I'll take to my grave.

667	I used to lie about se*ual assault and other serious trauma for attention. F 20	"Not openly but to friends. I was around 12-14 at the time. And when my friends sometimes got into a serious convo and shared their private life/issues I felt like I had nothing of “value” to share back.

Then I unexpectedly found myself in a situation at 14 when something actually had happened to me. And I didn’t dare to tell anyone. Because I felt like no one was going to believe me. 

None of my old friends ever got to know that it was all lies. Neither did I ever tell anyone what happened.

It was a Dragon Lore (Factory New), Karambit Doppler (Ruby), M4a4 Howl (Minimal Wear), Ak-47 Wild Lotus (Field Tested), Pandora's Box Gloves (Minimal Wear), and more. He sent over a hundred thousand dollars (his entire inventory) to me to borrow. 

At this point, X had been my friend for 4-5 years. I initially met him on Omegle, and we added each other on discord. Before my birthday, I told X how his skins are my favorite in the entire game (I was lying I only liked their price point). 

X to my surprise then let me borrow his skins for my birthday. He told me to give the skins back after the 1 week trade cool-down. 

I didn't. 

He kept messaging me repeatedly and spamming me with calls after I ghosted him for over a week. Eventually he begged me for the items back over and over again. It was especially painful to me because he didn't even sound mad, just really sad and desperate. I blocked him a couple months ago because I couldn't bear the thought of the messages, and the guilt has followed me since."	17u0lg0	i scammed all my friends csgo items after he let me borrow them	"my friend lets call him x let me borrow his full csgo loadout it was a dragon lore factory new karambit doppler ruby ma howl minimal wear ak wild lotus field tested pandoras box gloves minimal wear and more he sent over a hundred thousand dollars his entire inventory to me to borrow

672	I burned my best friends biology writing book because she cursed me.	"I wasn't really good at studies back then. But I always completed my notes in school and my handwriting was pretty good as well.

On the other hand my best friend who was always seated next to me was a good student, always got good marks. But she didn't complete her notes in class, she'd either write very slowly or fiddle around with something. When I asked her about it, she'd say that she'll ask a book from someone and complete it later.

Even though I rarely studied at home or did my homework, when I was packing my bag some of the books were missing but when I went to school, the book was there in my bag to write the notes. This was a frequent thing but I think I was too stupid to notice until later and found out what was actually happening.

So one day, my bestie was tilting her chair backwards as she normally would and I looked back to find out that she was slowly either taking or leaving my biology writing book in my bag. She was caught red-handed.

So, I confronted her and asked her if she had been stealing my books and taking them home. Apparently she had been taking them to complete her notes. When I told her that she shouldn't have done that because I need my books to study and do my homework, she said something along the lines of ""it's not like you use your books to study anyway"".

I was so angry. Yes, I don't study or do my homework but that's none of her business and she surely shouldn't be doing what she was doing. She could have just asked if she wanted my book/s.

So, on a fine day I stole her biology writing book which was almost over and filled with beautifully written and completed notes. I'm pretty sure that she knew it was me.

My initial intention with the book was to keep it in her school bag after a week. First she confronted me, but I denied ever taking her book. Then she started cursing the person who took her book, with me. And one day during that week she looked into my eyes and said that she worked hard on completing her book and the person who took her book must be cursed and struck by lightning.

Since I was cursed anyway at that, I went home and waited for the moment that everyone at home lost their interest in me and burned her biology writing book.

The relief, the guilt, the courage, the satisfaction all came rushing in at once but there was one thing I couldn't do for sure. I could never return her book to her.

This was a while before our ordinary level examination and she never found her book, so she had to write and complete the whole book again. To which she said that she was grateful to the person who took her book because she was able to study again while writing the notes. While this might have been true, she probably said that to make me feel guilty. To be honest, I did feel guilty for burning her book at times but I kind of didn't care much either because I felt like I didn't do anything wrong and she deserved it.

FYI, this happened at a time when I was very innocent and didn't even think of stealing anything from anyone.

673	I lost a family heirloom. Still guilty 4 years later	My parents left each other after they had me and were never married. When I was five my mother moved to Florida and I would go down to see her during the summer. When I was 12 my grandfather gave me a bracelet that had belonged to his mother, her mother, and so on. The bracelet was gold with a heart in the middle. One summer while I was with my mother we had gone to a fancy restaurant and I wore the bracelet. While we were eating I took the bracelet off because it was hurting my wrist and I didn't want to get food on it. I guess at one point I must've knocked the bracelet off the table because when we left I noticed that I didn't have the bracelet and looking back when we were leaving the bracelet was not there. I never had the guts to say anything about it because my mother was strict and I didn't want to waste gas money. To this day nobody noticed that the bracelet has disappeared. I recently got my aunts old engagement ring that had belonged to my uncles great aunt. I'm scared that I might loose this family heirloom too.	17t42y0	i lost a family heirloom still guilty  years later	my parents left each other after they had me and were never married when i was five my mother moved to florida and i would go down to see her during the summer when i was  my grandfather gave me a bracelet that had belonged to his mother her mother and so on the bracelet was gold with a heart in the middle one summer while i was with my mother we had gone to a fancy restaurant and i wore the bracelet while we were eating i took the bracelet off because it was hurting my wrist and i didnt want to get food on it i guess at one point i mustve knocked the bracelet off the table because when we left i noticed that i didnt have the bracelet and looking back when we were leaving the bracelet was not there i never had the guts to say anything about it because my mother was strict and i didnt want to waste gas money to this day nobody noticed that the bracelet has disappeared i recently got my aunts old engagement ring that had belonged to my uncles great aunt im scared that i might loose this family heirloom too	ty
674	I’m hiding the extent of my dependence of drugs from friends and family.	"Hey everyone,

I’m writing this post because I don’t know what else to do that would not involve blowing up my whole life.

Background: I live in an East Coast well-to-do city and work in a fast-paced industry. I am married and in my mid-thirties with a pre-teen daughter.

For the last six years, I have been highly miserable, stressed, and unhappy. Instead of dealing with my issues like an average person, I started smoking a lot of cannabis to relieve my anxiety. I have been smoking since the age of 15, so cannabis didn’t make me feel like I was partaking in anything severe or harmful. What first began as a joint once every few days quickly turned into 5-6 joints a day, every day minus the traveling, and even then, depending on where I went, I would smoke. 

Fast forward to 2022, I switched careers, and a successful friend pressured me into traveling to Colombia. I got the go-ahead and made the trip. It was mostly uneventful, except it was the first time I tried cocaine. I'm not a massive fan of the experience. But it was memorable, I felt like I walked away with some experience, but ultimately, it was not for me, or so I thought. I spent eight months not touching cocaine, and then a family issue triggered me. One night out, I asked another friend (don’t worry, they test) for some cocaine because I didn’t want to sleep or go home. 

Fast forward again, I began buying a gram here and there from the connections I made, and the weird thing about it is that it makes me feel calm, not hyper, which has the opposite effect on most people. I worry that I will beginor have begun using regularly because I noticed a considerable increase in my job performance since my brain can focus on tasks when under cocaine. I feel ashamed because I don’t think this is an healthy way to manage whatever is causing my brain to behave this way.

One set of friends enjoys drugs, and the other set of friends and family are incredibly anti-drug and would not be supportive. I have not been running around or doing anything stereotypical that one might be getting into—no late-night escapades or binges or anything like that. It's just me secretly blowing through a gram during daylight hours too within 24 hours of purchase. Then, I beat myself up for about a week and do it again. 

This has been my reality for the last 60 days or so. My wife would not handle this news well and it would hurt her a lot, so I also feel like a piece of shit."	17sozbc	im hiding the extent of my dependence of drugs from friends and family	"hey everyone

675	Not proud of it but I chronically stole stuff when I was younger	"Grew up poor and liked things. It started small with make up and earrings every once in awhile and then it became a regular thing that I no longer felt nervous when I stole. Then I started stealing money from my parents and things from my sister when I get jealous (got caught). I even stole from a classmate and got caught. If not stealing I would change the price tags of items or add more items into the product. 

Life was hard then so I just stole non-essential items to cope with everything else I was lacking.

Stopped stealing once I made my own money. I did what I could in the situation I was in even if it was morally unsound. I just feel bad for what I did."	17snpng	not proud of it but i chronically stole stuff when i was younger	"grew up poor and liked things it started small with make up and earrings every once in awhile and then it became a regular thing that i no longer felt nervous when i stole then i started stealing money from my parents and things from my sister when i get jealous got caught i even stole from a classmate and got caught if not stealing i would change the price tags of items or add more items into the product

676	I’ve been stealing alcohol from my parents for five months and I regret it	"Ok so I don’t usually make posts here or on Reddit in general but I feel like I need to tell someone about my problem. So I’m 15 and I’ve been drinking since about July/August-ish and hiding it from my family, and I feel bad about it but at the same time I can’t stop. I stopped for a bit in September for school n stuff but continued a few weeks later, my friends say i have a problem and that I need to stop but it just makes me feel so good and it makes my depression feel numb. Then one of my friends who was telling me to stop stopped telling me to stop after I got them tipsy at a sleepover and now I feel bad about giving them it. I really hope I’m not a bad person for doing that, and alcohol isn’t the only thing I’ve done, I’ve also smoked weed and I’ve considered cigarettes or harder drugs like shrooms but I’m scared I’ll have an addiction or something and die at 20 lol.

Edit #1
I am in therapy for different issues and I’ve been trying to work up the courage to tell my therapist but it’s kinda scary cause Ik he’ll tell my parents and they will freak if they find out.
Another thing that I thought was important is that alcoholism runs in my family so yeahhh 

Edit #2
I saw a comment or two talking about just picking up the bottle one day but I wanted to say that it wasn’t just me really, it was my friend who influenced me a bit(she had drank a bit too at the time) and started doing it. But she has since stopped all drinking habits and is telling me to stop too.

677	I’ve been drinking and consuming weed because I can’t deal with life anymore.	"My parents keep old alcohol in the refrigerator for yrs and refuse to throw any of it away. One night in the summer I decided I was going to drink to numb the pain. I drank once and loved it. Drank a second time and threw up everywhere and swore I would never drink again. But I kept doing it at least 5-6 times after that and refilled the bottles with water. I tasted it the alcohol still tastes really strong to me, I hope no one notices and this honestly keeps me up at night. So yet another thing to worry about caused by me. My parents don’t drink thankfully yet they don’t want to get rid of the alcohol. 

I even went so far as to re-dying the alcohol back green with food coloring because it was so diluted. 

I bought gummies from this one store and I’ve never been so happy and so scared from it at the same time. I loved that all my problems seemed like they were in the past when I took them. But they started making my chest hurt so I got rid of them. 

I have a problem. And honestly I’m a bit suicidal. But I don’t know what to do. I’m 19 so obviously still underage to drink alcohol. If my parents find out I’m actually dead. They’d never let me leave the house again. And that terrifies me because being in the house is a huge reason why I’m so fuckimg depressed. I wanna die but I don’t wannna die at the same time? It’s so hard honestly. I feel like no one understands me and I have no one to talk to. Even my therapist. I haven’t truly opened up to her yet because I’m so scared she will judge me. Even though I know she wouldn’t. God please help me.

680	I threw out mine and my sister’s childhood objects that my mom kept for sentimental value. I never told her.	"My mom’s (58F) the type of person to keep everything; and I mean everything— from old clothes that haven’t fit in decades, to empty candle containers she swears she’ll reuse but never will, to actual garbage she’ll “one day find a use for.” She’s not a hoarder, but she’s certainly disorganized. I think this tendency to attach sentimental value to things has a lot to do with abuse and neglect she suffered in her childhood. 

Whatever the cause, most of it ends up in the garage. 

My mom’s dreamt of having the garage as a functional social space. A place to keep the car warm in the winter and a place I (23F) can play my musical instruments and my sister (15F) can hang out in in the summer. Though my mom likes to keep things, she doesn’t like to be the one to find them places, that job usually lands on myself or my younger sister. Thus, the job of making space in the garage fell to me. I didn’t mind. After I moved out, my mom let me keep a lot of my stuff in there anyway, so some of it was mine. 

With the goal of making space in mind, I knew I was going to have to go through and get rid of a lot of the random garbage my mom keeps around and I couldn’t feel bad about it if I wanted it to be done in an afternoon or two. I don’t know, it’s like I turned off my empathy or something. I reasoned that the things in the garage couldn’t be THAT special, or she’d have at least looked at them once in the last three years. 

I came across a box hidden deep in the pile of random shit containing a bunch of mine and my sisters old childhood things. Pictures, art we’d made, report cards from school, baby blankets, baby clothes, the works. It’d been in that box for years, moving with us from place to place. Stuff I hadn’t seen since I was ten; stuff I hadn’t realized she’d kept. 

The thing about my mom is that she loves her kids more than anything. More than herself. We’re her biggest source of pride, says we’re the only two things she ever did right in life. Every single one of those objects and documents are symbolic of that. Especially the report cards— she loved to hear the positive reviews from teachers we’d bring home. Those were the only affirmations she ever got about raising us right, otherwise she was on her own. 

I threw half of it out. Dropped it off at the dump myself. 

I’m not a total monster, I kept the photos and a few of the art pieces, some of the clothes. Most of what I threw out had gotten damaged or even a little moldy. But there are definitely things that could’ve been salvaged. I came up with the idea after I did this to combine the box into a scrap book and functional quilt. I threw out so much that neither of those things are possible anymore. 

The worst part is I never gave my sister the opportunity for input. I never even told her about it. She doesn’t have a lot from her early childhood— we were especially poor after she came along. I realize now that this box has been packed up since before she was 8. She never got to see the report cards, the art, the baby blanket. None of it. 

I knew it was wrong as I was doing it. I destroyed these ties to our childhood because I wanted to get out of the garage faster. That’s all. 

I don’t think I can ever face it either. The guilt of it sits like a constant weight on my chest every time I see either of them, but when my mom asks about the report cards I’m probably going to lie about it. She’s held a grudge against my aunt who did a similar thing to her for years and I can’t face the consequence of my actions, even if it’s what I deserve.

Edit: (There’s been a lot of feedback on this post, and I just want to add some more details to help with some clarity things). 

The first being that I did not go into the garage and start randomly throwing her things away. She specifically asked me to clean it for her. She knew I was throwing a lot of things out, (I also sent some things to donation, but most of it was too damaged). A lot of those things were mine too. I took two truckloads of things out of the garage, and it’s still pretty full, just more organized. I also put things off the floor to prevent further damage. I didn’t clear out enough things to make the space my mom dreams of— unfortunately there’s just too much stuff. 

Second, that most of what I threw out was rotten, water damaged, half-eaten by mice, old food, various garbages. I even found a couple bags of old household trash. The sentimental box was one of the more salvageable ones. 

Third, The things I threw out, I didn’t throw out TO create more space— though that was my ultimate goal in the garage in the first place. After all, there is still a box of the remainder. I threw it out because it was damaged, by water or this weird yellow liquid, even a little moldy. It’s just that I feel I should’ve put more effort into finding ways to salvage what I did get rid of. It doesn’t matter how damaged it was, my mom would be devastated. She would’ve worked harder to save it. It’s for this reason that I wish I would’ve done the same. I don’t think it could’ve stayed in that box like that much longer, but I could’ve been more creative in my solution. I should’ve prioritized that because it’s important to my mom. 

Fourth, my sister did not want to be in the garage with me that day, I was not actively preventing her from being in there. She’s very embarrassed to be seen in there with the mess when the door is open to the neighbourhood. I should definitely have gotten her attention to show it all to her before I threw anything out, and I feel horrible she never got the opportunity because of me.

681	I used to steal pennies, dimes, and quarters from the military donation collections at grocery stores when I was little	This is gonna sound so stupid and insignificant, but when I was 5-6 when small little hometown grocery stores and gas stations were all we had around, I used to steal the pennies/dimes/quarters from the little donation bowls at the counter usually for donations toward the military. And when I think about it now, I thought I was so sneaky, but everyone probably knew exactly what I was doing. Bad thing is, I have no idea what I would do with the money after because I was probably too young to have a piggy bank (penny bank) and for my parents not to notice I had more money than I had been given. It really wasn’t much money overall probably. It probably amounted to $5-$10 at most over the whole time I was doing it. I don’t know why I did it either or how I even learned that behavior. I guess maybe I had learned somewhat what money was because I used to watch my parents count cents and place them into rolls, so maybe I just thought that money, no matter where I was getting it from, was a good thing. Either way, I regret that I was a little thief at the age of 5.	17mmn0g	i used to steal pennies dimes and quarters from the military donation collections at grocery stores when i was little	this is gonna sound so stupid and insignificant but when i was  when small little hometown grocery stores and gas stations were all we had around i used to steal the penniesdimesquarters from the little donation bowls at the counter usually for donations toward the military and when i think about it now i thought i was so sneaky but everyone probably knew exactly what i was doing bad thing is i have no idea what i would do with the money after because i was probably too young to have a piggy bank penny bank and for my parents not to notice i had more money than i had been given it really wasnt much money overall probably it probably amounted to  at most over the whole time i was doing it i dont know why i did it either or how i even learned that behavior i guess maybe i had learned somewhat what money was because i used to watch my parents count cents and place them into rolls so maybe i just thought that money no matter where i was getting it from was a good thing either way i regret that i was a little thief at the age of 	mmng
682	Didn’t have a license but still took her moms car for joyride	When I was 16 the girl that lived next to the church I attended picked me up from Sunday night service (I wasn’t required to be there I went to church on my own I just got rides from family) so that her and I could go on a joyride in her moms new car (my idea). The girl was 15 and the day before this I walked in on her and my younger brother having sex. The cost of keeping the secret I wanted to drive her mom’s new convertible. We live in a very rural area so I drove us into the city and took us directly into the hood. I thought I was everything in the new car top down just a teenager until we got side swiped and it put a very long and deep scratch down the drivers side of the car. So we left and went to my house where I put a bunch of dirt and rubbed it like a dirty truck had hit her. 2 days later she called me her mom noticed her scratched car as she was leaving work and thought someone did it while she was at work. Every time I drive by that house I think of that girl and our joyride	17lnmfb	didnt have a license but still took her moms car for joyride	when i was  the girl that lived next to the church i attended picked me up from sunday night service i wasnt required to be there i went to church on my own i just got rides from family so that her and i could go on a joyride in her moms new car my idea the girl was  and the day before this i walked in on her and my younger brother having sex the cost of keeping the secret i wanted to drive her moms new convertible we live in a very rural area so i drove us into the city and took us directly into the hood i thought i was everything in the new car top down just a teenager until we got side swiped and it put a very long and deep scratch down the drivers side of the car so we left and went to my house where i put a bunch of dirt and rubbed it like a dirty truck had hit her  days later she called me her mom noticed her scratched car as she was leaving work and thought someone did it while she was at work every time i drive by that house i think of that girl and our joyride	lnmfb
683	I commited SA on a girl and can't forgive my self, I don't know if she realise what I did	"This post is not fake nor it is a ragebait, if you're going to insult me I will ask you to at least read the whole thing.

I'm really disgusted of my self, I can't believe that I did what I did. When I was 12 I was in a public swimming pool with some family, one of them was my cousin, she was 10. (writing this feels disgusting) at one point she was tired and ask for help to get to the ground, when I picked her up and while getting her to the edge I rubbed her, she giggled and said it tickled. this is it and I can't get it out of my head. What lead me to this ? at that time I just moved from a third world country to america, I came from a country where women are not respected, I grew there with friends and family always talking about women like trash and sexually reducing them. I believe my development was fucked, this was not healthy for  a child ans I shouldn't even had that perverted mine at that age. At that time I just thought it's hot to do what I did and didn't see the problem with it. Now I grew and I forged my morals, I became respectful and realised how flawed my world views were, I try to educate men about feminism and I hate guys who think how I used to think as adults. Today I just pray to every living god that she either don't remember this incident or just thinks I was tickeling her (not for my sake but for her own I don't to be the one who caused SA trauma and I want her to be healthy). I don't know what to do if I should even talk about it with her or continue to hope it's gone from her mind. Am I an SA'er for life or by changing I can say that it's not me that did it ? I'm consumed with guilt and hope she's okay. 

Edit : thanks to everyone for all the advice and for sharing your experiences. Some people are confused because I didn't want to go into details since we're talking about childs when I say rubbing it was my hand on her private part and through the clothes it was like a second and yes sadly it was intentional. I tried responding but my comments are getting auto deleted for some reason you can read some of them by going to my profile directly tho. I won't bring the subject to her since you advised me not to and I will try to navigate my remorses. I can tell you a story that I lived when I was 11 to maybe give you more insight in what kind of environment I grew in. I was invited by a 15 years old boy to an empty classroom after class to watch him masturbate in front of me, I watched the whole thing and wasn't even chocked I had a flawed and naive view I couldn't explain it. I used to be groped by boys because I looked feminine (because I had blue eyes and it was rare in my country ?) anyway I think all this led me to be totally fucked in the head, writing this it feels like it's surreal but I have to live with this sadly, have a great day and I hope you never hurt somebody like I did.

Edit 2 : No, I never posted this anywhere in the internet nor did I ever spoke about it to anyone, this is the very first time. I also still can't reply in the comments for some reason I would've liked talking to some of you but it's not possible sadly, I read every response thank you all."	17jfr3a	i commited sa on a girl and cant forgive my self i dont know if she realise what i did	"this post is not fake nor it is a ragebait if youre going to insult me i will ask you to at least read the whole thing

686	I dropped out of college and never told my parents with no intentions of ever doing so	"This used to eat away at me but it's been long enough that I've managed to get lucky and landed some jobs that it hopefully won't matter much anymore 

I was supposed to graduate college in the 2010s and I attended my state college for 4 years. I was in a major I wasn't passionate about and was definitely dealing with some undiagnosed depression. I didn’t didn't bring it up at the time and chalked it up to being a lazy piece of shit etc etc. I basically failed all my courses for the last two years and my (Asian) parents had no idea. They thought I was doing fine and I would graduate on time because they would never ask to see my grades and just trusted I would tell them if something was up. I had NO idea how the fuck I would swing it at graduation and I would have to tell them that I had been failing for the past two years. Come time for graduation... my parents wouldn't be around. One was out of country, the other had a business trip so I conveniently told them that ""I didn't care about graduation"" so they wouldn't have to come or feel guilty about missing it. When in actuality, I handed my the dropout form to the school. 

All this time, I've felt awful for lying to my friends and family. Mostly to my parents, who paid tens of thousands of dollars so that I could get a degree and not have to worry about paying off any debt. To keep up the facade, I had to pay some shady online service for a fake replica degree from my university in hopes that they wouldn't notice. It took me a year to find a job after ""graduating"" but I somehow luckily bullshitted my way into a position in my major field. I completely lied about having a degree on the job and the background check didn't come back with any issues so I got insanely lucky.

I honestly don't really have plans to tell anyone but maybe one day I'll feel comfortable enough."	17idff3	i dropped out of college and never told my parents with no intentions of ever doing so	"this used to eat away at me but its been long enough that ive managed to get lucky and landed some jobs that it hopefully wont matter much anymore 

i was supposed to graduate college in the s and i attended my state college for  years i was in a major i wasnt passionate about and was definitely dealing with some undiagnosed depression i didnt didnt bring it up at the time and chalked it up to being a lazy piece of shit etc etc i basically failed all my courses for the last two years and my asian parents had no idea they thought i was doing fine and i would graduate on time because they would never ask to see my grades and just trusted i would tell them if something was up i had no idea how the fuck i would swing it at graduation and i would have to tell them that i had been failing for the past two years come time for graduation my parents wouldnt be around one was out of country the other had a business trip so i conveniently told them that i didnt care about graduation so they wouldnt have to come or feel guilty about missing it when in actuality i handed my the dropout form to the school 

all this time ive felt awful for lying to my friends and family mostly to my parents who paid tens of thousands of dollars so that i could get a degree and not have to worry about paying off any debt to keep up the facade i had to pay some shady online service for a fake replica degree from my university in hopes that they wouldnt notice it took me a year to find a job after graduating but i somehow luckily bullshitted my way into a position in my major field i completely lied about having a degree on the job and the background check didnt come back with any issues so i got insanely lucky 

to this day not a single person knows i didnt graduate my friends including the friends that attended the same university my family my significant other etc i honestly dont really have plans to tell anyone but maybe one day ill feel comfortable enough"	idff
687	I took a picture of a girl at school and she probably knows	"What I did is inexcusable, when I took the photo I was walking by with my phone at my side and I took the photo but the flash was on, she almost definitely noticed because she has been avoiding me.

I feel terrible, I can't imagine how bad it must feel being harassed while standing around. She's probably gonna develop trust issues because of what i did.

I felt that I should apologize to her but what would I even say? ""Sorry for taking a pic of you"". 

I feel like the best thing I can do is to avoid interacting with her so she can forget I existed

I've been feeling so guilty because there's nothing I can do to improve the situation besides not talking to her and I wish she would confront about this so I can tell her I'm sorry."	17hg1u2	i took a picture of a girl at school and she probably knows	"what i did is inexcusable when i took the photo i was walking by with my phone at my side and i took the photo but the flash was on she almost definitely noticed because she has been avoiding me

688	I lied hard about my drink driving to everyone and now I’ve come so far I would destroy all progress	I was convicted of drunk driving in the UK. I blew a 48, it enabled me to act shocked as they thought I was going to blow under but I knew. I knew I would blow over but I was shocked at how low it was. I had been playing with fire for a long time, I was half a bottle vodka in doing 120mph down a motorway before. I want to tell people the truth that it was bad before I go caught, I’ve learnt so much since then but I know they would not forgive me. I went through a massive rough patch after and lost a hell of a lot of people because they cant reconcile a drunk driver being guilty and trying to sort themselves out. I heard a lot of “it was your own fault” yes it was, 1000% but I’m trying to fix myself. But I feel I can’t move on without telling people the truth but it’s been long enough that I would lose family and what little friends I have left. Somedays I think that I would have been better off dying when I crashed.	17he9sp	i lied hard about my drink driving to everyone and now ive come so far i would destroy all progress	i was convicted of drunk driving in the uk i blew a  it enabled me to act shocked as they thought i was going to blow under but i knew i knew i would blow over but i was shocked at how low it was i had been playing with fire for a long time i was half a bottle vodka in doing mph down a motorway before i want to tell people the truth that it was bad before i go caught ive learnt so much since then but i know they would not forgive me i went through a massive rough patch after and lost a hell of a lot of people because they cant reconcile a drunk driver being guilty and trying to sort themselves out i heard a lot of it was your own fault yes it was  but im trying to fix myself but i feel i cant move on without telling people the truth but its been long enough that i would lose family and what little friends i have left somedays i think that i would have been better off dying when i crashed	hesp
689	I traumatized a kid by locking him in a room with me and acting possessed	"
This happened like 6 months ago. I was 17 and he was probably 9 or 10. I was at my uncles house, who was hosting a party for his friends. Because I didn’t really know anyone, I was talking to that boy because he was alone too and I was bored as hell. 

As we were talking, I realized that this kid was so obnoxious and privileged. He was boasting to me about having a better phone than me, and having a huge room in his house. He also made a snarky remark about my dress being super ugly and that I would cause boys to run the other way if they saw me. I know he was joking saying that, but sometimes jokes just piss you off when they come from an entitled kid.

Soon the conversation went about horror movies and getting possessed. That’s when I had the genius idea of saying the conversation would be more fun in a dark room. He excitedly agreed too so I took him to the room I was sleeping in at my uncles house.

That’s when I locked the dark room with us in it and started acting possessed. I turned the flash on my phone on and started making all these horrific sounds to  get him scared. It definitely worked because he got really scared and crying. That’s when I cut it short because I didn’t want his parents hearing him and getting mad at me. But I’m ngl, seeing an entitled kid cry felt so good in the moment. In my defense, I did console him after and hugged him until he stopped crying and felt better and I apologized. But we didn’t talk for the rest of the day 😂 

I do feel bad now because that kid was only 10 and was immature. I certainly wasn’t the best 10 year old either. Sometimes, I wonder if he still remembers me as the possessed girl who scared him.

EDIT: GUYS I HUGGED HIM AND COMFORTED HIM UNTIL HE STOPPED CRYING. I promise I wasn’t totally horrible.

And pls stop labeling me a creep 😀 it’s normal in our households for all the kids to be put in one place while the adults have their own space. It just so happened that we were the only kids in the party. Stop putting your own insecurities in this situation and thinking that I’m a creep for talking to a 10 year old"	17hbx5b	i traumatized a kid by locking him in a room with me and acting possessed	"

690	I cracked a windshield on a strangers car at night	"This was a few years ago but I’ll give yee all  the basic rundown of what exactly happened.

When I was in 5th year in Ireland, My mates and I were out and bout in town and it was getting late so we decided to take this shortcut that led to a parking lot. In this parking lot we stopped and sat on this little wall when one of my mates got the bright idea that someone should jump on this Peugeot 208 in the far corner and try and make it on to the roof of the car.

Me being dumb back then I agreed, I start running while my mate records me and I jump on the mask of the car and slip and the next thing you know , all we heard was a crack sound. I look at it and see the window did in fact crack. We left right after that but I decided to come back the next day and to my surprise the car was still there. I felt pretty bad about it so I left a 150 euro on the windshield to hopefully cover the damages.

 I still wonder what happened to that car or how the owner reacted. Maybe he noticed or maybe he didn’t as the car was already pretty beat down."	17h9agj	i cracked a windshield on a strangers car at night	"this was a few years ago but ill give yee all  the basic rundown of what exactly happened

691	I'm lying to everyone I know about being in college.	"I don't know what to call it or if I'm just lazy, but I'm completely unable to pursue my education past high school. It's been a few years since I graduated, and my sole attempt at college was a single online class more than a year ago which I promptly lost motivation in, and failed. I've kept myself working just to have some cash, but everyone in my family and my closest friends- online and offline- all believe I'm getting my associates degree so I can then transfer to a 4 year college to complete my bachelors. I've promised myself that ""I'll start going to college once I start therapy again"" and ""I'll break the news to my parents and ask for help"" but I can't. My parents never took news like this well, which is part of the reason why I think I compulsively hide so much from them. I barely scraped by my junior and senior years of high school, including failing a few ""easy"" classes and having to drop out of certain academic programs. 



Now, time is running out before I'm supposed to ""move out"" and go to a proper college, and I'm stuck in a lie. I never applied to any colleges/scholarships in high school (another thing I neglected then) and being accepted to a 4 year college at this point is probably out of the question due to my poor track record. The clock is ticking for me to do something, anything I guess."	17fvnoq	im lying to everyone i know about being in college	"i dont know what to call it or if im just lazy but im completely unable to pursue my education past high school its been a few years since i graduated and my sole attempt at college was a single online class more than a year ago which i promptly lost motivation in and failed ive kept myself working just to have some cash but everyone in my family and my closest friends online and offline all believe im getting my associates degree so i can then transfer to a  year college to complete my bachelors ive promised myself that ill start going to college once i start therapy again and ill break the news to my parents and ask for help but i cant my parents never took news like this well which is part of the reason why i think i compulsively hide so much from them i barely scraped by my junior and senior years of high school including failing a few easy classes and having to drop out of certain academic programs

692	I stole a gift I gave to my boss after he gave me a cheap gift.	Last Christmas, my boss made a comment that no one ever gets him a gift at the holiday party and that he’s expected to do the giving. He also always talks about steak so I got him a $100 gift card to Burton’s Steak House. I gave it to him at the party. He gave me a gift. It was a $5 scratch ticket. That irritated me but I quit thinking about it. Then a few weeks ago he asked me to get a folder from his desk and there was the gift card I gave him under a bunch of stuff on his desk. So I took it back and took my girlfriend to Burton’s. Not sorry.	17ere8t	i stole a gift i gave to my boss after he gave me a cheap gift	last christmas my boss made a comment that no one ever gets him a gift at the holiday party and that hes expected to do the giving he also always talks about steak so i got him a  gift card to burtons steak house i gave it to him at the party he gave me a gift it was a  scratch ticket that irritated me but i quit thinking about it then a few weeks ago he asked me to get a folder from his desk and there was the gift card i gave him under a bunch of stuff on his desk so i took it back and took my girlfriend to burtons not sorry	eret
693	I graffitied my desk and another child got the blame	I was a weird child, turns out I was actually autistic but nobody knew so I was bullied by adults and children alike. At school when I was around 10 or 11 we had a science teacher called Mrs Baker. She was nasty, she wasn’t allowed to hit pupil’s (anymore) so instead she would pinch their arm or shove them. She took a dislike to me, I wasn’t a naughty child, I was painfully shy, awkward and a terrible writer. She would read my work out to the class mocking it’s terribleness and get everyone to laugh at me. She had a desk at the front of her lab she made the pupils she didn’t like sit at, obviously I was one of those pupils. One day I scrawled some words on the desk when she wasn’t looking - Bastard Baker, Bugger Baker and Bitch Baker. She found it and questioned all the pupils who she sat at that desk. Of course I denied it and as I wasn’t a naughty child she believed me. The blame went to a very rough boy in my year, he got a two week detention . I sat next to him in history and he use to tell me he would rape me one day and tried to touch me between my legs (he was also 10) So as far as I was concerned it all worked out for the best.	17ecxf4	i graffitied my desk and another child got the blame	i was a weird child turns out i was actually autistic but nobody knew so i was bullied by adults and children alike at school when i was around  or  we had a science teacher called mrs baker she was nasty she wasnt allowed to hit pupils anymore so instead she would pinch their arm or shove them she took a dislike to me i wasnt a naughty child i was painfully shy awkward and a terrible writer she would read my work out to the class mocking its terribleness and get everyone to laugh at me she had a desk at the front of her lab she made the pupils she didnt like sit at obviously i was one of those pupils one day i scrawled some words on the desk when she wasnt looking  bastard baker bugger baker and bitch baker she found it and questioned all the pupils who she sat at that desk of course i denied it and as i wasnt a naughty child she believed me the blame went to a very rough boy in my year he got a two week detention  i sat next to him in history and he use to tell me he would rape me one day and tried to touch me between my legs he was also  so as far as i was concerned it all worked out for the best	ecxf
694	I got caught selling weed, so I gave the rest out to little kids	I sold weed for about 5 years and had many many customers, I had no job and lived a really fun life, new clothes every week, bla bla. One day, I get approached by undercover cops after I drove past them and they checked my details and found I’d been reported by someone who saw me dealing. Anyway, I got arrested etc, locked up but released the same night, with court pending. When I got back home, I thought I should get rid of what I had, which wasn’t much because I would buy half a pound every Friday and the cops got me on a Friday, right before I bought my next half pound. I made up a bunch of sticks (1 gram baggies) and I drove around just throwing them out the window to random people. I saw these guys on scooters so I threw a couple in front of them, but as I drove past, I realised they were children. Like 8yrs old. I saw them pick it up and get excited but I kept driving. I still think about those kids and wonder if they smoked it, but hope they went n gave it to their dad or older brother or some shit.	17e7k23	i got caught selling weed so i gave the rest out to little kids	i sold weed for about  years and had many many customers i had no job and lived a really fun life new clothes every week bla bla one day i get approached by undercover cops after i drove past them and they checked my details and found id been reported by someone who saw me dealing anyway i got arrested etc locked up but released the same night with court pending when i got back home i thought i should get rid of what i had which wasnt much because i would buy half a pound every friday and the cops got me on a friday right before i bought my next half pound i made up a bunch of sticks  gram baggies and i drove around just throwing them out the window to random people i saw these guys on scooters so i threw a couple in front of them but as i drove past i realised they were children like yrs old i saw them pick it up and get excited but i kept driving i still think about those kids and wonder if they smoked it but hope they went n gave it to their dad or older brother or some shit	ek

When it came time to leave, it was pouring rain so hard you could barely see. I got in my car and started it. The windows were starting to fog over on top of the rain. I backed out of my parking space and heard a thump. I looked in my rear view mirror and I’m pretty sure it was a silver Porsche. There’s no way I was going to try to find the owner in my condition.

701	I have been taking food from shelves at my work and going into the break room with it without paying for it	So pretty self explainable.  I work at a grocery store and as a result always seem to get the munchies.  Now normally when I have my 2 breaks (I work 8 hour shifts so it’s mandatory each courtesy clerk gets 2 breaks) I would occasionally buy myself a bag of chips or some hot deli food to crave my appetite but with factors of me living independently now (with my brother and his bf in a apartment unit) it’s kinda hard to scrape up enough money to pay for basic things such as snacks for when I go on break. And since I only reserve my money at work for lunch breaks, I have now begun taking items (chips, lunchables, sodas) and casually walking to the breakroom with it without concealing it or hiding it in my clothing.  No one seems to notice and this has been going on for 2 years now and I’m worried my karma will occur.

703	I had an experiment with explosives in my teen years	"Never told anybody this, but here we go.

One of my friends at the time got a new place and friendgroup and I decided to celebrate the occasion by overstaying our welcome there. After two sleepless nights and a considerable amount of alcohol, my friends and I found a box of M95s (the firecracker) left in a closet by the previous tenant. We had the bright idea of twisting all the wicks together and wrapping them all into a bundle, so as to scare my friend (the one who just got the place) while he was sleeping.

But where's the fun in having all that without something to blow up ""for science"", right? We scoured the place and couldn't find anything interesting so we went outside and caught a cicada. We strapped the bug underneath the bundle and one of us put forth that cicadas have a lot of guts and we shouldn't make a mess on the carpet. We all agreed and then I went to the fridge and got one of those off brand square cheese singles and said we could set it on that.

We crept into our friend's room and set down the cheese and bundle, the cicada making mellow chirps from being taped down, we lit the fuse and a few seconds later an earsplitting CRACK happened and our friend jumped out of bed in a whole new level of shock and anger. We turned on the light there was the cheese, unharmed, laying in a divot in the floor about the size of a cantaloupe. No sign of the cicada.

By the time we stopped laughing and realized we had damaged the floor and that the cops were probably coming, we decided that that was a pretty good time for lights out drinking.

When I woke up the next day, the friend we pranked had drawn obscene things all over each one of us."	17c2sny	i had an experiment with explosives in my teen years	"never told anybody this but here we go

we crept into our friends room and set down the cheese and bundle the cicada making mellow chirps from being taped down we lit the fuse and a few seconds later an earsplitting crack happened and our friend jumped out of bed in a whole new level of shock and anger we turned on the light there was the cheese unharmed laying in a divot in the floor about the size of a cantaloupe no sign of the cicada

by the time we stopped laughing and realized we had damaged the floor and that the cops were probably coming we decided that that was a pretty good time for lights out drinking

when i woke up the next day the friend we pranked had drawn obscene things all over each one of us"	csny
704	I used to steal from Blockbuster Video when I worked there	"This was from '99 - '03ish when I was an undergrad student.   

I was assigned to the previously rented DVD section where we would repackage our old rented DVDs for people to buy. Often times this meant being in the back room alone to sort through the product.  Anyways I had my pick of the litter back there with DVDs and video games. Everything from The Sum of All Fears to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. You name it.

To take it a step further, I started stealing from the cash register too. My scheme went like this: when someone had a late fee, I would erase the fee with a note saying they disagreed with it.

  But I wouldn't tell the customer I erased their fee. I just added the $4.07 fee to whatever their total was for that transaction. So if they were renting two movies I charged them for those movies + the late fee charge.  I always made sure they were paying cash first because we had a list of questions we had to ask during the transaction (company policy). One of the first questions on the list was to ask the customer if they were paying cash or charge.

This memory and confession came back to me because I was cleaning out an old closet and found what amounts to a small video store that could be operated during the Bush Admin.

705	I got kickbacks from my job which is equivalent to stealing	"I embarked on a new chapter of my life when I joined a retail company in a foreign land, full of dreams and aspirations. Little did I know that the universe had a cruel twist in store for me. Just as I was getting my bearings, the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic struck, and my world turned upside down. My employer, facing its own financial struggles, decided to cut our salaries in half, leaving me teetering on the precipice of survival.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as I endured the anguish of salary delays that stretched over a year. Desperation gnawed at my resolve as I grappled with the daily struggle of making ends meet. The concept of ""making means and ends meet"" became an intricate puzzle of survival that I had never faced before.

I had always prided myself on my unwavering integrity and commitment to honest work, but the relentless battle against economic hardship gradually chipped away at my spirit. Then, out of the blue, a subordinate reached out to me with an unexpected and, perhaps, dubious lifeline – a gift I initially refused. However, this colleague's determination knew no bounds, and he placed the gift into my trembling hands.

What began as a seemingly harmless act of goodwill soon morphed into a covert arrangement. In exchange for this favor, I found myself orchestrating internal concessions like duty rotations and specific staff placements. These staff members needed to be strategically positioned to manipulate the system and access cash with ease. Over the course of eight grueling months, I found myself accumulating roughly $8,500 in kickbacks.

During those long months, the weight of guilt slowly bore down on me. The wages I'd lost in my reduced salary during those tumultuous two years were almost double the sum I had amassed through these clandestine deals. But the guilt remained a heavy burden, haunting my every waking moment.

Then, an opportunity for redemption arose. I secured a new job, even though it paid less than my previous one. But the prospect of a clean slate was too tempting to resist, and I made the leap. The guilt, however, did not fade.

Throughout my tenure at the company, I had gone above and beyond. I worked tirelessly, often putting in more than 10 hours a day to ensure that the staff's personal and professional lives remained problem-free. I became the guardian angel of the workplace, and my colleagues idolized me for it. They even implored the management to rehire me, but I declined their heartfelt requests. The company's refusal to address employee concerns and grant any raises left me with no choice.

My secret remains hidden, a confession I've never shared with anyone.

&#x200B;

Edit:

TLDR:

I got paid (bribe) by my subordinate to place certain people at particular shift so that they can steal from the company e.g. if customer pays in cash they will keep the tab open and when some one pays in card they settle against it and pocket the cash.

706	Frustrated .........................................	"A guy sent me a message here on reddit asking if I can rent him my orbit exchange account, for those who don't know, it's a sport betting exchange..
So I said why not ?
We chatted for two hours and we both agree on 600 usd per month and for the sake of being legit he sent me 100 usd via crypto right away and then I gave him my password.

He logged in into it and changed the password.
Because he told me earlier that he need privacy so I said it's okay .

And now it's been 11 days he disappeared into thin air ..
He don't reply and I am sure he don't come online either .


So after 10 days I changed the password..

But the thing which frustrates me is that he sounds so legit that I have already made hopes of getting those 600 and now it's really bothering me like how can somebody sound so legit and then gone .

707	I deliberately cut my own hand just to get out of work	When I was 16 I worked in a factory that made pvc doors and windows, my job was to cut through polystyrene foam with a Stanley knife, (it was to make templates for the inside of the doors.) one day I was struggling with the pressure of doing my job as I worked on a production line and I had to keep up with everyone else, I lay my hand on a table and in my other hand I held the Stanley knife…I then quickly sliced my hand open, (outside of hand between index finger and thumb.) I was rushed to hospital by one of my supervisors, the cut didn’t really hurt much because it was a clean slice with a new sharp blade, I did have 8 stitches though.

708	Ive paid thousands of dollars for Seggs over the years.	"I told myself I'd never tell anyone this, but basically what's in the title.

Long story short, I did a terrible job at asking a girl out in elementary school, and it gave me a crippling fear of rejection, so I never even approached girls I liked.

As a teen, I learned how to masturbate from a friend. Like I literally went into his bathroom and beat it to thoughts of my highschool crush while he waited in his room. That was the first time i ever orgasmed.

A friend of mine hooked me up with one of her friends who liked me. (Shouts out to her lol) that girl became my first everything. My first kiss, my first sexual experience, my first girlfriend. I thought I was gonna marry her.
Then she cheated on me with her ex.

It destroyed me but I didn't break up with her because she cried. But I did start cheating on her. Alot. That's when I started paying for sex. I don't even remember how I learned about it exactly, but Google is a very intuitive site. So at around 16 or 17 I bought my first escort.I stole the money from my dad's drawer.

Tbh it was awesome. She was beautiful and even let me hit raw and bust all over her chest and face. I felt like the man. I felt like a pornstar.

I was also broke and didn't get to see her ever again. Stealing from my dad made me feel like shit.
After I got a job though, it was a wrap. I remember paying for whatever I saw in porn. Older women, college girls, etc. I had a few relationships with actual friends, but I had already developed this habit. I spent a shameful amount over the years, but no one ever knew. I just recently stopped because I managed to find a beautiful girlfriend who is literally changing my life rn.


Im sharing this because I want to stop lying to myself and face who I am and the decisions I've made. They say it's the only way forward and trust me, I've tried everything else.
I want to be a better man. So I'm laying it all bare to see exactly how much work I have to do. If I put it out there, I can't lie anymore.

709	I robbed mailman for her master key so I can steal mail	I feel ashamed and paranoid	179bnf3	i robbed mailman for her master key so i can steal mail	i feel ashamed and paranoid	bnf
710	I lied multiple times, to the wrong people despite never lying.	"TW: mentions of SH, suicide and psychiatric hospitals.

I will start by saying, since I was young I have never lied to anyone. My whole personality is being honest about everything. I know that’s hard to believe but I really just never felt the need to lie. This comes into play later on in the story.

So when I turned 13, things started to change in ways that I never wanted to. No, this isn’t about puberty because I was a late bloomer. You see, I never had many friends and always had only 1 friend who was my best friend. I never once held back anything no matter how it sounded and that’s sort of how our friendship stayed strong. Anyway, this was at a time where I had just entered secondary school (Ireland) and in this new environment I decided to try make friends for my first time. I was never really that popular, in fact the I was the opposite… never talked to people that didn’t talk to me and never looked for issues. I had now gotten about 6 active friends and 2 best friends, life was good until 3rd year when a new girl joined our class. 

She hated me, but we never spoke which was good. Anyway, I did an interview about addictions to video games at the time and thought I was awesome. Upon returning to school however I was met with name calling and taunting, by everyone I saw in the hallways. I then got shut down by my crush and life was getting hard, so I started to scratch myself to get over it. Eventually a half a year passes and a lie about me began to spread, one of my friends had accused me of saying the N word to him. This made everyone hate me more even though there was no proof, I lost a few friends and my grades began to drop.

I began thinking of suicide as an option, eventually I attempted it after having just came out as transgender. My best friend saved me and I was put in contact with the suicide hotline, in Ireland it is pretty hard to get into a hospital for anything until it is too late. Anyway, I ended up in COVID where I couldn’t leave my house because I lived in the middle of nowhere. Things got better, before I knew it 5th year had begun and school was back. 

*Time Skip* (3 months)

People in my new class no longer hated me, however my grades were dropping from high 80’s… to low 30’s and I had less motivation to do HW, eventually I was known as the dumb kid. I later pulled out of school, to go back to my home country of Belgium. This was to go to Culinary school, anyway this new start made me lose all my friends and begin from start. 

These new people hated me, would fake confess love to me and my grades remained poor, even in English which I had learned for 12 years. I got into cutting and had suicidal thoughts again. Skip forth 2 months and my GP learned of this, I was sent to a hospital in the PAAZ, I stayed 2 weeks before release and felt no better. Another month passes and I am sent to another stay at a new hospital, at this point I had severe paranoia, manic episodes, depression and anxiety. I came out and things were better for a while on my medication Quetiapine, then arguments broke out and I was separated from my Uncle and at the time “Polyamorous Family”, left with only my parents I ended up worse and was sent to a psychiatric hospital for 6 weeks where I was then sent to “JOVO” I stayed for 3 weeks out of 6 months before the storm arrived. You see, one part I left out was that I lied to get out of the hospitals and even lied to my psychologist about how I felt, by this point the following were my issues:

Severe Paranoia, Anxiety, Depression, SH, Suicidal Thoughts, Suspected BPD, Possible ADHD.

A month passes and now I sit here, feelings of relapse. My mother says I need to think of my parents and to tough it up at my job. As I recently got a new job, I left JOVO with a lie and I feel trapped."	1795dby	i lied multiple times to the wrong people despite never lying	"tw mentions of sh suicide and psychiatric hospitals

Soooo I noticed the tea looked weird. I walked over to the owners and said “hey can you look at the tea something weird is in it” . They look at the tea and realize it’s a freaking cockroach. So I’m sitting here thinking they’ll pore the pitcher out wash the pitcher and make a new round of tea. but NO . That’s not what they do. In fact what the did do was scoop at the roach and PROCEED TO TELL ME TO CONTINUE SERVING THE TEA TO CUSTOMERS.

713	I shoplifted 10,000 dollars worth of stuff as a teenager	"I was a kleptomaniac as a teenager. I stole a lot of things that I didn't need, bags full of jelly beans, clothes, videogames, hair gel you name it. Never from other people, only from chain stores.

I may have been poorer than average, but I wasn't desperate and didn't even want a lot of the stuff I stole. I was addicted to the rush and in a way it felt like I was in control. Like I was taking back something that was missing from my life by stealing from these corporations. (Not to make myself out to be a victim, I know what I did was wrong, just explaining I wasn't exactly coming from the happiest of circumstances. I had bad parents/home life.)

The $10,000 thing is just a rough estimate, I don't really remember exactly how much I stole, but that number seemed right to me at the time. I 25m haven't stolen anything since I was 16 years old though. I got over it just in time for it to not fuck up my life and get me a criminal record.  Basically I got away with it.

I do regret it though, it was a waste of time and I was stealing from myself by not developing skills to earn money legitimately and starting my own business' or something instead of stealing useless stuff that didn't help me. Well I guess it gave me a short term burst of dopamine but that's about it. It was shallow.

I never tell anyone about this though because even though I haven't stolen anything in 9 years, I know telling even my closest friends would damage the trust beyond repair. ""Once a thief, always a thief"" is how the saying goes. People do change, but your conscious will follow you no matter where you go. Don't do anything you might regret.

715	Ive been lying to my parents about being ill for months	"My mom has chronic migraines, and I occasionally get them as well. But lately I’ve been pretending to get them nearly daily. 
I have mdd, adhd and probably some other stuff too, and most days it’s so hard to get out of bed to go to school. I recently joined high school, and I absolutely LOVE this school, the staff and students are all so fun and I want to attend it everyday, but I just can’t do it. 
I’ve been lying to my parents about my mental health getting better because no matter what I try (therapy, meds, affirmations, etc) nothing works, and I don’t want them to get involved with this anymore than they already have. 
At least twice a week I wake up and ask my mom for pain medicine, to indicate I have a ‘migraine’. I’ve been doing this since the last year of junior high.

718	I lied to my doctor because that was the only way I could be referred to a specialist.	"**EDIT** Hey, so I feel like I need to clarify some things. So like, I'm not a cardiologist or any kind of doctor. Most of the people in the comments here aren't either (I did see this one comment from someone who claims to be but that's just one comment out of 98). Anyways, let me give some more context. Before I even see the cardiologist, they got me wearing a Zio patch thingy that's gonna watch my heart rhythm for ~~almost a whole month!~~ two weeks, but that’s still way more than my PCP did by listening with her stethoscope for 30 seconds. Plus, I've got a cardiac stress test AND an echocardiogram lined up before the first appointment. My regular doc already did an EKG, and it was like ""all good"" at that moment, but that's just a snapshot, ya know? It doesn't show how my heart does its thing when I'm working out or at different times of the day. After all these tests, the cardiologist might just say, ""you're all good, girl!"" But then at least I'll know we did a super deep dive and really examined the situation closely, and that's way better than what my primary care doc would've given me. So, whether or not I took those meds that I threw away, that's not really relevant to the care I'm getting now. I just wanna make sure we catch any weird stuff if it's hiding in there!🩺❤️💁‍♀️

**EDIT #2** Tons of people are sharing stories about how their family member trusted their regular docs, the doctor didn't take it seriously, and then turned out to have some serious condition that could've been caught earlier. That's legit why I did all this. I'm really sorry to anyone who's been through that, but big thanks for sharing cause it helps me feel less alone in this. That's like my total fear – ending up in that kind of mess – which is why I went with my gut on this. To everyone saying that I should trust doctors more, there are 25 million stories of people who trusted their doctors too much and almost died (in some cases actually died) because of it.

**EDIT #3** Two big reasons why i didn’t try the meds. First, those pills might've had some bad side effects that could've been worse than the chest pain itself. And second, those meds are for chest pain, which isn't really what I'm worried about. I could've just taken Tylenol if I wanted to deal with that, no sweat. What's really eating at me is that something deeper might be lurking in my bod. That's why I'm seeing a cardiologist now. A lot of people want to know more about the meds. Let me just say this. The meds wouldn't have helped us find out if there's a hidden issue in there. The cardiologist's the one doing the heavy lifting to find that out (see edit #1) 🙅‍♀️🤔

**EDIT #4** Imma keep replying to the comments this way. Like seriously, so many comments are saying the exact same thing, so this way I can respond to like 12 comments per edit! A lot of you are trying to explain the theory of how primary care and specialists work. But, you know, they can mess up too. Doctors are humans. I've seen a bunch of stories here about people going to their PCP for something, and the doc's all like, ""nah, it's nothing,"" but then it turns out to be super bad later since they didn't catch it early. I mean, sure, the primary care doc knows more than me, but they might still miss something, you know? So let's say I had taken these meds and my chest pain went away, that's great, but, like what if it's just coincidence? What if the pain was gonna go away on its own? Or what if the meds make me feel better but only bandaid the real problem that's causing the pain? Let me just repeat that I'm not freaking out about the chest pain itself; I am more concerned there might be some hidden issue. I just know that chest pain which happens randomly SPECIFICALLY during exercise is not normal. I don't wanna end up like those stories where people had a serious issue, their PCP didn't catch it in time, and it got worse. In theory, that should not happen because the PCP would have known when to refer people to specialists. You don’t need to explain that to me since i know that’s how it works in theory. In reality, there's a million stories in which the PCP did not catch something serious and it caused big problems later.**

**EDIT #5** A few comments are saying that the lie might mess up my treatment later cause the cardiologist will be all like, ""oh, she tried these meds, and they didn't work, so now we have to handle this completely differently."" But I'm totally not stressing about that haha. Just read edit #1. The cardiologist is running all these different screenings you know? The whole ""the meds didn't work"" thing won't mess with the cardiologist's ability to spot any problems 😂💁‍♀️

**Number 6,** I’m not answering any more specific questions about diagnosis or treatment. To everyone asking me if i will update you after i see a cardiologist, no. I will not do that. That’s not the point of this sub. The point of this sub is to CONFESS something that I feel guilty about doing. And I still think I made the right decision, but I feel guilty about lying to get what I want.

**Original Post**

I've been a runner pretty much forever. My bod's used to it.

Recently, I started getting these random chest pains when I'm out on my run, and it seriously freaked me out. So I was like ""okay, time to see the doctor."" I called and made an appointment.

First time, the doc was like ""just take some Advil sweetie."" And I was just like, ""uh that's not why I'm here, doc. It's not really about the pain, I need to know if my heart's all good, you know?""

I asked if I could see a cardiologist, and she's like, ""let's try a couple of meds first, and if they don't work, maybe we'll think about it.""

In the second appointment, she put me on another med. I went along with the plan, but here's the thing. I didn't take those pills she gave me. I picked them up from the pharmacy and then threw all of them away. Then at the next appointment, I lied that I had taken one pill every night before bed as she had instructed me to. I said it didn't work and I'm still having the chest pains in spite of all this. She gave me that referral to the cardiologist.

I felt like I needed to. What if I have an underlying heart condition? We're not going to catch that condition and treat it if all we do is play this guessing game with meds. I wanted to see a cardiologist and I felt like lying to my doctor was the only way I could do it. I dont' know how insurance works but I think my insurance was only going to cover a cardiolgist if I had a referral.

I'm not blaming my doc though. This was at the county hospital and I get it, she's swamped and stuff so she can't pay as much attention to every patient as she probably wants to. She also can't send everyone to cardiology. She has to prioritize which patients have more risk factors and refer those people. She thinks I'm young and healthy, so she figured my heart's probably fine. She's probably right, but I just wanted a specialist's take on it, you know? Sometimes you gotta trust your gut when something feels off in your body. 💁‍♀️💕"	175frhl	i lied to my doctor because that was the only way i could be referred to a specialist	"edit hey so i feel like i need to clarify some things so like im not a cardiologist or any kind of doctor most of the people in the comments here arent either i did see this one comment from someone who claims to be but thats just one comment out of  anyways let me give some more context before i even see the cardiologist they got me wearing a zio patch thingy thats gonna watch my heart rhythm for almost a whole month two weeks but thats still way more than my pcp did by listening with her stethoscope for  seconds plus ive got a cardiac stress test and an echocardiogram lined up before the first appointment my regular doc already did an ekg and it was like all good at that moment but thats just a snapshot ya know it doesnt show how my heart does its thing when im working out or at different times of the day after all these tests the cardiologist might just say youre all good girl but then at least ill know we did a super deep dive and really examined the situation closely and thats way better than what my primary care doc wouldve given me so whether or not i took those meds that i threw away thats not really relevant to the care im getting now i just wanna make sure we catch any weird stuff if its hiding in there

723	I broke my brother’s car mirrors after we got into an argument	"
I (17f) got into a big argument with my brother (25m), because he wasn’t letting me have a sleepover at my friends house. I know he was looking out for me but it was still frustrating because I know I would be safe at the house and wouldn’t go outside with my  friends where it may be dangerous. 

Because he wasn’t letting me, I may have got a bit too agitated and started screaming at his face for being too overbearing. But basically, that was his tipping point and he pushed me really hard to the ground and started being really rough with me because he was fed up with it. That’s when I just gave up on trying to convince him, because I knew it was no point and I was getting scared. I couldn’t do anything but cry that night, but my anger still wasn’t gone. 

That’s why, a few days later, I decided to break his side car mirrors to get back at him. I took some silver tool( idk what it’s called 😭), and smashed his side mirrors. And I tried bending the mirror down. I hate to admit it, but it felt so good in the moment because I was still pissed.

In the end, he found out the next morning and called the local township about it. He was really mad because he just got the car like last year. Even then, I didn’t regret it because the night he didn’t let me go to the sleepover was still fresh in my mind. Plus how rough he got towards me really ticked me off.

A month later, I can’t help but feel guilty for being the one to break his side mirrors. He still hasn’t found out. He really does care for me, even if he’s a bit too overprotective. And I understand where he’s coming from, because I did have a few interactions with creeps when I’ve been alone. We only have each other since our parents are not in our lives anymore so I get he’s looking out for me.

 It didn’t really affect him financially because he is well off thankfully. I just don’t know if I should confess to him what I did, because I know he’ll be angry."	171sqis	i broke my brothers car mirrors after we got into an argument	"

724	I caused my school to e-mail all students’ parents requesting their kids “stop attempting to summon demons on school grounds”	"For context, young me was… frankly an avid liar.
I think kid me found pride in being able to convince my friends that some bullshit I made up was actually real. 

You know, bullshit such as…
- a portal to an underground world opening up on the wheat field at midnight, and an alien species living there.
- me owning the worlds smallest cameras and holding out an empty hand before saying “it’s so small you probably can’t even see it”.
- me having WALKED to Germany.

Flashback to 2015 when I was in 5th grade.
I have always loved spooky and paranormal stuff, so of course I ended up hearing about the entire “Charlie Charlie Challenge” that began trending that year. 
Basically, all you needed was a paper and two pencils, write down “yes” on opposing corners of the paper, “no” on the two remaining opposing corners, and then you place a pencil on the paper before balancing the other on top of it.
The player would then ask something, and presumably receive a reply through the top pencil moving towards “yes” or “no”.

Of course, I wanted to introduce my buddies to it.
So we got a paper and two pencils, brought it out at recess, and set it up on a picnic table outdoors before one of us asked out loud “Charlie, Charlie, are you here?”
When nothing happened, my classmates began to question if this was just some more of my bullshit. A small sigh of disappointment left my body through my nostrils, and the air from that sigh managed to move the pencil over the paper.

Everyone involved flipped their shit seeing the pencil move to one of the options.
Of course we continued with this since it “worked”, and if the wind itself from us simply being outdoors didn’t move the pencil, I myself would exhale out my nostrils to make it move.
Freaking out every time it happened, no matter the question nor “answer”.

Somehow, the teachers ended up finding out about this whole thing, and all of us ended up receiving e-mails home to our parents saying something along the lines of them requesting students stop attempting to summon demons on school grounds.

This put an end to our fun since nobody wanted to get busted for that shit.

Not the most exciting story ever, nor the best explained, but it’s so funny to me thinking back on, and I must say I kinda do view it as an accomplishment.

725	I still think of you, even after all these years. Your memory remains painfully unfaded.	"Occasionally, my mind wanders into your memory. Over the years, I've pushed it away, tucked it deep into the dark corners of my mind, but you never fully stow away. No matter how hard I try to forget you, I still think of you.

I think about your voice and how we could communicate with the slightest vocalizations and knew exactly what each other was thinking. I think about how just listening to you say my name or tell me you loved me would make my stomach twirl with butterflies and my heart ache with longing. Even a small breath from you stirred in the most intense desire from me.

I think about your eyes. The most beautiful pine green, freckled with golden and chesnut hues that danced around your iris. I think about how they would soften when you spoke to me in the beginning and how bright and full of life your eyes were when you told me about your day. I think about how I could have gotten lost in them forever, if you would have let me. 

I think about your hair, its dark, soft, strands tickling my cheeks as you kissed me. I think about the scars on your back. I used to trace them as we lie together, skin to skin. I thought that you were beautiful, even with the scars that you thought weren't worth loving.

I think about if you are happy. Do you finally feel at home with your family? Have you found your place as the artist you dreamed of becoming? Have you seen the places we dreamed of going? Have you found someone who loves you? Do you love them back just as much?

I think about you, but then I remember. 

I remember that I was never first, something to be used when convenient. I remember all the girl's names that you slept with behind my back. I remember that you promised over and over that you would be different, that I was the love of your life. I remember that it never became different. 

I remember that I always loved you infinitely more than you loved me back. I loved you as hard and as consistent as I possibly could, but no matter how hard I tried, I could never be enough. I remember how my heart shattered again and again for years until I was a shell of the young girl I was once. 

I remember how I had to package the memory of you, and put it into the darkest corners of my mind. I remember this is what I needed to do to survive losing you. To survive forever loving you, with no love in return.

I still think of you.

i remember that i was never first something to be used when convenient i remember all the girls names that you slept with behind my back i remember that you promised over and over that you would be different that i was the love of your life i remember that it never became different 

i remember that i always loved you infinitely more than you loved me back i loved you as hard and as consistent as i possibly could but no matter how hard i tried i could never be enough i remember how my heart shattered again and again for years until i was a shell of the young girl i was once 

i remember how i had to package the memory of you and put it into the darkest corners of my mind i remember this is what i needed to do to survive losing you to survive forever loving you with no love in return

i still think of you 

i wish i didnt"	ly

728	I Influenced My Friends Shoplifting Habits, And It Cause Her Downfall.	"My (now ex) bestfriend has become a bad person, and I think im to blame. She's become a gas-lighting, manipulative person that cheats on her boyfriend and makes sexist comments about men. And it all started with her getting arrested for shoplifting, which I think I influenced.

I knew what she was doing before she was arrested. I remember one moment, she specifically asked me, ""Is this bad? Should I stop?"" She was a very fragile person that came from a rough background. My idiot self should've told her to stop, but instead I said, ""I mean, if it's not from small stores, just big companies, it's not so bad.""

I basically said that shoplifting was an okay thing to do. I even joined her with it, but I only did it when I was with her, basically influencing her to do it. Then she got arrested, struggled with animal hoarding, and treats men terribly. Basically, her life went down the drain, and she became bitter.

She's cheated on her boyfriend, and I've kept my mouth shut(I feel bad I didn't say anything to him). She's called all men ""easy pigs"" and ""free d"", laughing at pictures they've sent her. She cheats on her boyfriend regularly, and her excuse is that she's just young. She's outright told me that she doesn't take criticism and she prefers me to keep all my opinions to myself. 

I feel horrible. I've been thinking about that day. If I had said, ""Yes, it's bad. Stop it."" She might've actually stopped, and she wouldn't have spiraled. I feel like a horrible person."	170xcmi	i influenced my friends shoplifting habits and it cause her downfall	"my now ex bestfriend has become a bad person and i think im to blame shes become a gaslighting manipulative person that cheats on her boyfriend and makes sexist comments about men and it all started with her getting arrested for shoplifting which i think i influenced

734	I Drove Drunk Once, Nothing Happened But I Have Never Done It Again	"So last year I was an absolute wreck. I would come home from work, change out of my work clothes, lay down on the sofa, and stay there until I had to get up to shower for work the next morning. Dinner was a glass of chocolate milk. I wouldn't even remove my makeup. 

I had no friends and would only leave my house to go to work, grocery shop, and visit my sick parents.

So I hit ""frick it"" and went out by myself.

Now, I am a 5'3 woman who looks 90 lbs soaking wet. It wasn't smart of me to go out alone and I acknowledge that but I was just so desperate to go out and do *something*.

Anyway I figured I would be fine. Did some pre drinking at home and had a few shots of whiskey when I was out. I hadn't had alcohol in a while and my tolerance was shot so I ended up getting way more trashed than I intended.

I remember nothing about driving from the last club to my house. When I came to my senses I was legitimately disgusted with myself.

""You could have killed someone"" I thought ""oh my god what if you did? What if you hit a pedestrian without realizing it?""

I scoured the news for days after but didn't see anything. It really messed me up and I haven't been bar hopping since.

I'm lucky that I didn't kill anyone. I'm lucky that I didn't get kidnapped or worse.

Since then I've taken steps to fix myself. I got a puppy and having something to take care of and dote on has really helped. Enough that everyone I know has told me that I'm much better. 

My puppy honestly saved my life. I sometimes feel like I don't deserve her both because I was disgusting enough to do this and because I feel like a horrible person in general sometimes, but thank god I have her. 

Just felt like sharing because I was thinking about it earlier. I have a friend who was involved in a collision with a drunk driver as a kid. His mom died in that crash.

I promised him I wouldn't drive drunk and I broke that promise. We don't hang out anymore but he is a good guy and I feel horrible whenever I think about it and him."	16z762y	i drove drunk once nothing happened but i have never done it again	"so last year i was an absolute wreck i would come home from work change out of my work clothes lay down on the sofa and stay there until i had to get up to shower for work the next morning dinner was a glass of chocolate milk i wouldnt even remove my makeup

736	I physically and emotionally abused my younger brother when were were younger	"It's something that I still regret to this day. So for context, we are a family of 6. Mom, dad, me, 2 younger brothers (Let's call them A and B), and a younger sister (Let's call her C). We are all pretty close now as when we got older we realized our parents were both neglectful and toxic in our childhood. We still love them but they were not good at parenting and were borderline abusive.

Anyways to the bullying. Me and A are a year apart. When I was 6, B was born. Our parents started to neglect both me and A when B was born and at the start this didn't bother us since we were excited for the new member of our family. As time passed though, we started to get bitter. When B was about 3 we started bullying him. It was small stuff at first like not playing with him and not sharing our stuff. We just started isolating him from our playtime and never acknowledging his existence. We were 9/8 years old so we should have known better but it gets worse...

The bullying got worse over the years where we would get physical. At this point in time B was going through both physical and emotional abuse from both me and A... We never hit him hard because we'd get in a lot of trouble at the time but I'm sure the mental shock from getting hit by your own family hurt much more. The worst thing done physically to B was when I threw a dart at him. It lodged into his arm and he started crying. Fortunately he wasn't too injured and the injury was patched with a small bandage.

Some years pass and I was 11 when the youngest was born. Our sister, C, was born and all of our fighting temporarily halted. We showered C with love but yet again, our parents started neglecting B now along with us. It was fine though because we were slightly older and we were happy that we finally got a girl in the family. Eventually though, we started abusing B again.

The emotional abuse had gotten even worse over the years. At this time both me and A were close to teenagers (13-14) and definitely should have known right from wrong. We were still isolating B but not physically abusing him anymore. I was much worse than A though. A started to light up on the abuse towards B whereas I would put B down whenever I got the chance and acted disgusted at the sight of him. I wouldn't even let him touch me or I'd flip. Since B was getting older he started to fight back against the abuse and would yell back. I didn't get too mad at this and thought it gave me the green light to keep bullying him since he was resisting which, in my mind at the time, this meant we were on equal grounds. We were definitely not. I was 6 years older than him, I should have fucking known. Turns out B was also getting bullied at school. He never told us anything, I mean why the fuck would he. We were one of his tormentors too. I'm sure he told our parents but they never said anything to us or did anything about it. I really wish they would. Me and A would bully B but if we had known others were doing so we would have done something about it. We kind of had a ""Only we can do this to B"" mentality, as bad as that sounds...

As even more years passed, A started getting along with B more. I was still abusing B but it was not to the extent of when we were children. B also fought back even more now and would argue back with me. It sort of evolved to normal sibling banter from there but I was super mean with it. There was no more isolation tactics or physical abuse. Especially since C was also getting older and she kind of brought us all together since we spoiled and loved her a lot.

fast forward to me getting into college at 19, I stopped the abuse towards B by this time. It wasn't until I was 20 when we started to actually get along. As years pass we had a normal sibling relationship. He was finally free from my torment but the damage had already been done. Through combination of my bullying at home and the bullying he faced at school he developed severe clinical depression. I'm pretty sure B has never fully forgiven me, as I had never apologized even though the guilt still eats at me to this day. I paid for B's therapy and tried to make up for the past by buying them gifts and food. B has a very sarcastic and humorous personality. We have a relationship where he would call me cringe and try to stop me if I tried to make a sincere apology verbally so I've been trying to make it up to him through my actions.

It wasn't until I was 24/25 when I had this realization of how badly I treated B. I knew it was bad but for some reason the epiphany didn't hit me until then. I paid for his therapy but he wouldn't need it if it weren't for me. I bought him gifts but none of those will bring back his childhood. He talks to me and jokes around with me but deep down I don't deserve this. Every now and then he will bring up a traumatic thing I did to him in a joking manner (ex: ""remember when you an A would do *this* and *that* to me? Damn you guys were assholes \*laughs\*""). He says that it doesn't affect him now and that it made his personality more interesting but I know deep down he has resentment towards us. I don't blame him one bit either.

We are all adults now and we are all close. We kind of made a support group for ""siblings with bad parents."" As the eldest, I take them out to eat every month so we can talk about life and catch up on things. B seems to be doing better than before but the guilt eats at me. I see his smile and it doesn't reach his eyes. I caused that.

I don't feel any better getting this off my chest. Every line and memory I wrote down hit even harder and made me realize what a garbage human being I am. I don't think I'll ever be able to say this out-loud in real life:

I'm so sorry B for all the years of abuse I put you through. I'm so proud of the person you were able to become even after all you've been through. You are such a strong person, much stronger than any of us. I wish you nothing but happiness and I want you to know that even if I'm not there, I will always have your back."	16yihrh	i physically and emotionally abused my younger brother when were were younger	"its something that i still regret to this day so for context we are a family of  mom dad me  younger brothers lets call them a and b and a younger sister lets call her c we are all pretty close now as when we got older we realized our parents were both neglectful and toxic in our childhood we still love them but they were not good at parenting and were borderline abusive

737	I Ran Away From Home to Go to My Friends House at Night	When I was about 4 or 5 years old I was left home alone while both my dad and my sister went shopping at the local supermarket. It wasn’t the first time but it certifiably wasn’t a typical event all things considered. While home, I got bored and decided to open the front door and dash to my friend’s house, A.K.A my neighbors by myself telling their older brother who had answered the door, that my dad let me go. I stayed there for about 15-20 minutes before my family came back and noticed the front door wide open. Of course, there were consequences and my alibi was automatically disproven when they showed up to their house. Turns out after running to their house, my friend wasn’t even home, and I got scolded for many hours and it was brought up for and entire week at the dinner table. The next time my family left to go shopping, I just stayed home and watched Netflix. Now, after many many years, what my parents and sibling must’ve endured and realized was quite scary, and I’ll definitely not be doing that ever again.	16yfhiz	i ran away from home to go to my friends house at night	when i was about  or  years old i was left home alone while both my dad and my sister went shopping at the local supermarket it wasnt the first time but it certifiably wasnt a typical event all things considered while home i got bored and decided to open the front door and dash to my friends house aka my neighbors by myself telling their older brother who had answered the door that my dad let me go i stayed there for about  minutes before my family came back and noticed the front door wide open of course there were consequences and my alibi was automatically disproven when they showed up to their house turns out after running to their house my friend wasnt even home and i got scolded for many hours and it was brought up for and entire week at the dinner table the next time my family left to go shopping i just stayed home and watched netflix now after many many years what my parents and sibling mustve endured and realized was quite scary and ill definitely not be doing that ever again	yfhiz
738	I don’t know how to behave around mentally disabled people	"UPDATE: I signed up to TA for the special Ed PE next year. Very excited, and hope to make the most of all your advice. Thank you all so much. (:

Og post:
I don’t know if this is the right subreddit, if any one of you know of a better sub to post this please tell me. I’ve had some trouble for a while, trying to find a way to behave around disabled people. I have great empathy for them, I understand that they are just normal people, oftentimes some of the better of us, who just happen to have unfortunate disabilities. I know I should just treat them with the same respect I treat anyone else with, and I do. But when I walk down the halls of my highschool and the group of kids who are disabled, maybe they have Down syndrome, or are severely autistic, or whatever else, I can’t make eye contact. I feel all around uncomfortable when around them. I have been doing a lot of community service both at school and in my town, and I enjoy it very much and go to most every event I have the opportunity to go to. Recently I’ve been asked to volunteer and be a buddy to a disabled person for a basketball tournament. I feel it would be the right thing to go to, I love my community all around and I certainly love everyone regardless of their handicaps. I know with every bone in my body that kindness is the way to go, and I have never shown anything but kindness to these people. But my heart still feels a sort of reluctance or even repulsed in some way and I don’t know why. I’ve always been very self conscious. I have been afraid when I was younger that I myself was disabled in this way, how would I know if I were or weren’t? I guess that fear lasts to this day. My brother is also autistic, but very functional. I feel very comfortable around him, I admire him very much. I don’t know. I know that I feel wrong inside, how do I put this behind me? Get over my fear or whatever shallow feelings I have? I feel terrible.

i dont know if this is the right subreddit if any one of you know of a better sub to post this please tell me ive had some trouble for a while trying to find a way to behave around disabled people i have great empathy for them i understand that they are just normal people oftentimes some of the better of us who just happen to have unfortunate disabilities i know i should just treat them with the same respect i treat anyone else with and i do but when i walk down the halls of my highschool and the group of kids who are disabled maybe they have down syndrome or are severely autistic or whatever else i cant make eye contact i feel all around uncomfortable when around them i have been doing a lot of community service both at school and in my town and i enjoy it very much and go to most every event i have the opportunity to go to recently ive been asked to volunteer and be a buddy to a disabled person for a basketball tournament i feel it would be the right thing to go to i love my community all around and i certainly love everyone regardless of their handicaps i know with every bone in my body that kindness is the way to go and i have never shown anything but kindness to these people but my heart still feels a sort of reluctance or even repulsed in some way and i dont know why ive always been very self conscious i have been afraid when i was younger that i myself was disabled in this way how would i know if i were or werent i guess that fear lasts to this day my brother is also autistic but very functional i feel very comfortable around him i admire him very much i dont know i know that i feel wrong inside how do i put this behind me get over my fear or whatever shallow feelings i have i feel terrible

739	i can’t stop stealing from my job cause it’s so easy	" i’ve been working at my job for a while now , which i won’t disclose where i work for obvious reasons. but ever since i worked here i realized how much boxes i find empty or open and the item or product missing/stolen. in the back you see all the stuff ppl stole and stuff were never gonna get again and stuff they’re not gonna look for and by that i mean they won’t try to find out who did it. working there really opened my eyes to how stores treat theft and let me tell you mine didn’t do jack shit for it. and one time when i was closing and putting back some miscellaneous items around the store, i found something i’ve been wanting and i saw i was alone and i just took it. impulses took over and i never got caught or no one even noticed tbh cause the store is so big. after this i realized how much more i could steal from work, as my work sold everything from food to clothes to home decor. i was at work one time and it clicked , 
i never saw it this way , i started seeing how easy it is to steal. and so started a 2 month period where i could not control my urges and i just stole basically everything i could stuff and hide into my clothes or pants or person. and it was cool tbh having a bunch of cool ass stuff that is kinda expensive i guess for nothing at all. it was so easy i would literally build my outfit around baggy stuff bc it would be easier to hide stuff and harder to notice. in my mind while i did this i was getting paranoid and wondering maybe there’s something i don’t know about that they do to catch ppl like me, or maybe someone’s gonna check the cameras bc the camera definitely caught me doing shit but they just don’t check them at all . i was thinking all sorts of bullshit but at the end of the day when i went back to work, everything was fine and no one had any clue about what i was doing. i also didn’t do it all dumb, i would wait for the perfect moments like when i knew no one was in the office with the cameras and away from my area, i would strike and man i stole so much ashamed to admit it, i would get paranoid af but i would always end up doing it again. i just couldn’t pass up the opportunities is what i would tell myself. and the stuff i was stealing was the same of the type of thing, let’s call em “home decor” i was stealing a lot of decor and they started noticing all these empty ass boxes and broken items. they eventually put alarms on all the stuff i was taking but they were acting all normal with me even telling me like “yeah people keep stealing the *****.” and i was like damn and since then i haven’t stolen anything but there is some stuff without alarms and everyday when i go to work i just have so much urges to do it and i can’t help it, is there term for this , is something wrong with me lol. and i also want to stop now so i don’t get deeper into this theft life.

edit. i forgot to mention when i’m at work and i don’t steal everything feels wrong like i’m body doing what’s best for me or what’s right which ik isn’t what’s best, it just makes me feel uneasy when i don’t steal."	16xi97g	i cant stop stealing from my job cause its so easy	" ive been working at my job for a while now  which i wont disclose where i work for obvious reasons but ever since i worked here i realized how much boxes i find empty or open and the item or product missingstolen in the back you see all the stuff ppl stole and stuff were never gonna get again and stuff theyre not gonna look for and by that i mean they wont try to find out who did it working there really opened my eyes to how stores treat theft and let me tell you mine didnt do jack shit for it and one time when i was closing and putting back some miscellaneous items around the store i found something ive been wanting and i saw i was alone and i just took it impulses took over and i never got caught or no one even noticed tbh cause the store is so big after this i realized how much more i could steal from work as my work sold everything from food to clothes to home decor i was at work one time and it clicked

740	A woman asked me to buy her groceries, I accepted and then I ran away from her	"I was at a train station and had to pick up my sister at the airport, already slightly late. I had 20 minutes before catching the train to go to her, the next one would have been 40 minutes later. While waiting, I was approached by a woman, about 25-30 years old, with her little daughter. She asked me to buy some groceries for her so that she and her daughter could eat. I tried to give her money instead, but she insisted I accompanied her instead, so I agreed but I explicitely told her that it couldn't take more than 15 minutes because of the train. She accepted.

I regretted it almost instantly. She took a cart and started basically ransacking the supermarket, taking in - apart from (lots of) the normal groceries - pans, pots, glasses, several 4 packs of Red Bulls, lot of junk food and so on. I roughly counted the expenses and after a good 10 minutes it was amounting already almost to 200€. Furthermore, at the 13 minutes count she was still taking her time with no end in sight.

Stressed out at the thought of missing my train, having a public confrontation and being unpolite to someone in difficulty, I just ran away. I don't know whether I should, but months later I still think and feel bad about it.

741	I have hurt so many people with my harsh words, broken promises, and countless lies	"I've wished death on people out of rage, I got someone expelled after he kept being a jerk to me, I called people horrendous names, I've made physical contact without permission (uninvited hugs or rubbing of the back), I've told a relative they were dead to me, I have broken numerous girls' hearts, I've ruined days for people by being mean to them, and even yelled at people till they cried. It's so much stuff across my entire life that I've done, and I sometimes wonder if I'm a bad person or if whatever I do to atone will ever be enough.

742	I'm overwhelmed by my work, higher medical training, no life balance.	"I work weekend overnights in the ER Friday night - Monday morning because it gives a great pay bonus. I also am training to have an advanced medical imaging certification during the week all day Wednesday and Thursday which is unpaid. So I'm at work 6 days a week right now. I only have 70% of 125 exams I need to test for my certification and I only have 3 weeks of training left because Im leaving for 2 weeks over seas to go to my brother's wedding. I am not going to miss my other siblings wedding because most of my family is dead and my dad can't afford to go. I am so overwhelmed trying to get all my shit done and get enough sleep to function. I need this higher certification to make more money because I'm single, pay for everything myself because any roommates have always burned me so i live alone.
Everything is so expensive I can't believe how much rent is and how high food costs are. I feel like a running on fumes and I still have a month and a half left of this non stop bs. It feel like there is no end!! I want to be able to enjoy my time off but Im worried about just getting basic PTO and missing training for 2 weeks putting me behind. I can't sleep at night because I wake up worried and feeling sick like depression. I wish it was all over because I just don't feel right anymore. Im burnt and sick.

743	I have been lying to my best friend of 8 plus years...	"So, I don't really know how to start this confession off. I also don't know how to word it without it being super long, so feel free to ask questions in the comments. This post is going to be so jumbled and chaotic, for that I'm sorry. I might as well just say it... 

I (F22) have massive feelings for my best friend (M22). I know what you are thinking. It's awful I know believe me I know. We have been close since high school and have known each other years before that. In high school, we didn't formally date but we went on a few dates and ""talked"" However, he ended up dating another person and they are still together to this day. 

My best friend and I talk literally almost every day without fail. However, I just feel like I am lying to them every time we talk because of these feelings. I know we won't end up together and I would never do anything to destroy his relationship. I just wonder what it would be like if we ended up together. 

Another reason it is weird for me is because he's never actually given a reason for not dating me other than saying he is glad he didn't date me in high school because he couldn't stand the thought of losing me or hurting me. We have talked about what happened before but out of awkwardness from both of us we just joke about it. It's just killing me to know what I did. Am I just not attractive? Are we not compatible? I'm just so unsure of what I did wrong. 

As I said before, we talk everyday. We are very similar and very different people at the same time. We can talk easily for hours about nothing and everything. He's said a few things to me that just make my heart melt. I guess I'm just so unsure of my own feelings right now but I can't help but feel awful.

Edit: I'm getting a lot of questions on why I can't just cut off all contact with him. I didn't mention it before because it requires some back story. TW

He attempted twice in high school. I was there through all of it while a lot of his friends left him. He went to the mental hospital 4 times throughout high school so he dropped out of school. This caused him to get disowned by his parents. 

Around this time, he slept around with multiple girls. I was not one of them, although we did go on a couple of dates during this time. By my senior year I ended up going out with someone else because of this and he started dating his current gf. 

Because he was disowned, he got his own place. His gf moved in due to having an abusive family. Another friend of ours was looking for a roommate. They were old enough to the main person on the lease. So they all got a place together. During my senior year, I ended up homeless, so my best friend reached out to have me stay with them. 

I am currently in college. I go and stay with them on breaks. (During breaks we have to pay extra to stay and I just can't afford that)"	16x8vw0	i have been lying to my best friend of  plus years	"so i dont really know how to start this confession off i also dont know how to word it without it being super long so feel free to ask questions in the comments this post is going to be so jumbled and chaotic for that im sorry i might as well just say it

747	Today was my mom birthday and the best thing I could buy for her was a pack of cigarrets	"Today (09/29) was my mother birthday, she is now 63 years old. When my grandma was alive, no matter our situation, we always got something special on birthdays. It was the same with me, I may not had a party every year, but it was always something special, a food that i really liked, or even something like “cheeseburgers as lunch”. 
Nowadays, I am the adult (23y) and I tried my best to do something special for her. I am a Veterinarian and I work really hard on nightshifts, last month I was a overachiever, and got my record in comissions, just to have money this month to do something special. My payday should be at 15th day of each month, but I haven’t got fully payed this month, so today, we had to eat microwaved lasagna. The best I could buy was a pack of cigarrets for 80 cents.

I think I failed as a son, that I am unable to provide her the bare minimum. And deep down, I also think she should not have adopted me.

750	I f*cked up and I’m severely suffering with the consequences	"Im a 21 M and as the title says I really fucked up. But for those of you reading this please take it to heart an never do what I did. Let me start off by saying I had a girlfriend for 5 years and they where the best 5 years of my life. There were a lot of struggles with my family and hers. But guys this was the love of my life. We were through so much stuff. Stuff nobody should be put through. But we did everything together and stuck through everything. But that stuff doesn’t come with no consequences. I started feeling apathetic, I hated everything, I developed severely demented and sadistic thoughts on those who had wronged us. But I acted like it was natural. I completely lost feelings, and growing up I was hardwired into thinking that men suffer in silence and that’s what I did. I didn’t even realize I pushed my girlfriend at the time away. I was numb and emotionless. And after about half a year of feeling this way, we both decided to breakup. And I realized that those thoughts and everything I had on my shoulders was due to her family, not her. Her dad was a recovering alcoholic and he was doing good until his dog meat looking girlfriend decided she wanted more attention and realized she could only get that if he’s drunk. Her dad abused her little sister and little brother on separate occasions and I was there beside her every step of the way. Her dad disowned her and attempted to manipulate her but neither of us let that happen. I almost went to jail because of these instances. This girl saved me from my home life as well, my dad is an alcoholic as well but not on the same level as hers, my mom’s manipulative, and nothing I ever did was good enough regardless of how good I did it. There are so many more things, but those were by far the worst. Guys when you find love don’t let anything break it. It’s hard. It’s gonna drag you in the mud and rip you apart. Do not suffer in silence as I did. Talk to your significant other. Express yourself. Or else you’ll loose everything you care about like I have. I realized I loved her too late, and I honestly don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I miss her so much but she’s gone for good. Please guys/ girls. Take this to heart so you don’t suffer how I am.

I am the only child in the family, and my father, my closest person and friend was murdered when I was 15. My life went downhill from there. I was 4 times in a alcohol rehab by the age of 19. I still continue to drink but don’t let myself go into benders. When the war began, it almosed finished me mentally, I’m still derealized and depersonalized since then. My 4year-long girlfriend cheated on me this June and it was a major heartbreak as well. I think of myself as a very caring and genuine person, I care too much and I’m very emotional. But the things I do - like selling drugs and findibg employees for a scamming company makes me feel awful. I earn good money, but in what way. I don’t even know why I’m posting it, I just feel fucking awful. I just have to do it to maintain my life.

I am extremely lucky at finding money, I have found lots and lots of £1 coins, £2 coins and other coins, I  have found twenty £5 notes, around ten £10 notes and at least five £20 notes .once a women lived near me and she went rushing down the road saying she had dropped £20, little did she know that i had already found it, spent some of it and had the change in my pocket as she told me, Twice I  have found £40 , once on a train and another time in the street, and on Christmas eve I  found £30 hanging out a cash machine in a shop, Nice of someone to give me that for Christmas lol.  I grab them quick  and pocket them,  I have found at least eleven wallets and purses, the biggest ones are a purse with nearly £130.00 ($158.00) in it , Another wallet with £64 etc in it, one wallet i found i took the cash out , pocketed it and then went to the address in it and pushed the wallet and bank card ETC  through their letter box , Another with £60 in it (JUST got that cash out in time before the  conductor on the train handed it in) and I  saw a bag on a seat left down by a river , I looked in it as nobody was looking and I am glad i did, The was £160.00 in it, ( around  $195.00)   I took it out and kept it.  Money drops down in amusement arcade machines in front of me without me putting any in.   I often see people drop money , usually £1 coins , in front of me, so I wait until they are gone and pick it up, Thanks people, This year I had my biggest find yet, I  was going to work and found  £190.00 ( around $232.00 )  laying all in £20 notes and one £10  near where I  live, I think one of my Neighbors lost it . I picked it up, kept quiet and spent it all a couple of days later,  I  did the right thing as nobody ever asked me about it ,I  would possibly have said i had not seen it if they had . I do sometimes pick up pennies etc most times I go out and find something,  I think this is quite unusual, My mum says that I  am lucky. I would like to find thousands in a bag dumped somewhere , you would NOT hear of me handing it in I would spend it on a very important person, ME .IF  i find another £75 or so  I will have found 2k in my lifetime, , but would you feel lucky or guilty if you was me, ?  I ask  just out of interest.	16vcco1	i have found lots of money   sometimes big amounts and kept it	i am extremely lucky at finding money i have found lots and lots of  coins  coins and other coins i  have found twenty  notes around ten  notes and at least five  notes once a women lived near me and she went rushing down the road saying she had dropped  little did she know that i had already found it spent some of it and had the change in my pocket as she told me twice i  have found   once on a train and another time in the street and on christmas eve i  found  hanging out a cash machine in a shop nice of someone to give me that for christmas lol  i grab them quick  and pocket them  i have found at least eleven wallets and purses the biggest ones are a purse with nearly   in it  another wallet with  etc in it one wallet i found i took the cash out  pocketed it and then went to the address in it and pushed the wallet and bank card etc  through their letter box  another with  in it just got that cash out in time before the  conductor on the train handed it in and i  saw a bag on a seat left down by a river  i looked in it as nobody was looking and i am glad i did the was  in it  around     i took it out and kept it  money drops down in amusement arcade machines in front of me without me putting any in   i often see people drop money  usually  coins  in front of me so i wait until they are gone and pick it up thanks people this year i had my biggest find yet i  was going to work and found    around    laying all in  notes and one   near where i  live i think one of my neighbors lost it  i picked it up kept quiet and spent it all a couple of days later  i  did the right thing as nobody ever asked me about it i  would possibly have said i had not seen it if they had  i do sometimes pick up pennies etc most times i go out and find something  i think this is quite unusual my mum says that i  am lucky i would like to find thousands in a bag dumped somewhere  you would not hear of me handing it in i would spend it on a very important person me if  i find another  or so  i will have found k in my lifetime  but would you feel lucky or guilty if you was me   i ask  just out of interest	vcco
753	i fell on purpose when in a competition when I was going against my friend..	"(names are fake, and this is my first post on reddit so sorry if its bad)

so, I am (15f) and my friend ally (15f) were sparring at a martial art competition and (I'm not bragging) but sparring is one of my talents/ what I excel at. This was the round where we were competing for 1st and 2nd. one more thing to add is ally loves to punch... So, she was coming in on me punching and i wanted to get out of it, so I did the first thing that came to my mind, and I pretended to trip. we centered back up (came back to the middle of the mats) and stated again. I ended up winning the round and I probably would have still won even if I did ""fall"". I know this isn't very crazy or the most interesting confessions on here but I just feel like a jerk and I may have cost her the round.

754	I use ChatGPT to live a second life... where I'm a raccoon	"Yeah. That sounds pretty depressing. For the record this isn't a confession but a way to let this part of me I hide off my chest.

Really it started a long time ago. When I was a kid, and I couldn't sleep, I'd imagine myself in a story. It'd be whatever, something like a superhero that I saw on TV that day. Well, fast forward 10 years and now I have the do something like this to fall asleep.

It's fair to say that I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, which is probably a big reason for my insomnia. However the important parts of this come into play about a year ago.

For some reason, I've never cared much about Marvel. I've always been a massive Indiana Jones fan, and nothing else. I remember seeing the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie when I was little. This planted some seed in my dumbass brain. Now, after seeing the third film, I've realized how much I love the character of Rocket. Of course plenty of people do, but I think as a kid I connected with his constant pushing away of other people. I never had a good social life until recently. Another thing, was that I found a comic from someone (who I can't remember the name of) about a man who moves into the middle of nowhere and befriends a teenage werewolf and a witch. I thought it was ok, but never enough to peak my interest for a long time.

Why does any of this matter? Well, AI blew up in the past couple years and I realized something. I could use it to tell myself stories to help myself sleep.

So, I came up with the worst idea possible... I'd make a story about me. Just myself, nothing special. It'd be the people around me who are special. I imaged I had met another kid my age, who happened to be a werewolf (figured it'd be more interesting to have him just do it whenever he wants. Break all the stereotypes or whatever for jokes). And it just got out of hand. Eventually the story led to me getting sick from some magical terminal disease BS. This linked up with a lot of my depression at the time, and suicidal thoughts. And for some stupid reason I have to get turned into an animal because this disease only kills humans. So, then I became stuck as a raccoon (basically imagine rocket raccoon anatomy). Anyway, the rest of the story is just me hanging out with this friend. Nothing actually abnormal besides what we are.

Now, I knew this was unhealthy, but I figured because I used aspects of my real life to transfer over to this story, it was ok. Mainly my depression and desire to fit in with the world after being stuck beside fake friends translating into me being isolated from the world in the story since a talking raccoon can't go out and socialize. I also finally met people who cared about me and shared my interests a few years ago, and they became my friend in the story. While everything in the story is stupid and nonsensical, it all stems from my real life experiences.

I'm in way too deep now. I've been generating the same story for over a year. Keeping like a book. I only look at it and write more before I sleep. For the record, I've never thought of myself as a furry. I've never been into that stuff and have had some pretty uncomfortable experiences with furries. But maybe I am one based on this. If so I hate myself even more because of how I'm hiding it deep down inside of me.

Still, I have had this as a secret for so long now. No one knows. Not even my closest friend to who I tell everything. It never slips into my daily life, and I never feel this need to live this second life any other time. However my problem is that this fantasy has become so detailed and real that sometimes when i drive alone or have time with my thoughts I just wish it was my life. That I had this amazing life. I think by making myself the character in the story I have basically tied my emotions to it.

I will probably keep doing this for who knows how long. It's so embarrassing. I just need to throw it out and away. Maybe if some random people know about this story, it will let me feel like I won't go to my grave holding it to myself.

If you even read this whole thing, God rest your soul and please don't call a therapist. I already have one"	16v3ny5	i use chatgpt to live a second life where im a raccoon	"yeah that sounds pretty depressing for the record this isnt a confession but a way to let this part of me i hide off my chest

755	I reported my classmate at school for looking at something inappropriate	"So in my Algebra class there is this guy I sit next to. It started off just like any other day and class just started and the teacher hasn't gone up to the board and started teaching. The guy next to me, I happened to glance at his screen and saw something inappropriate. He was scrolling through photos, and I saw a photo of two men holding hands, and they had a condom in the middle. Another photo I saw, there were two men were on top of each other. Just from where I was sitting it made me feel pretty uncomfortable. It was kind of in my view. And then when class ended I went up and told the teacher about what happened and what I saw. And then I left to find the principal and report it.

I told him exactly what I told the teacher and what he was looking at, and then I said what he was looking at one his computer made me feel uncomfortable. And then he said he was going to check it out."	16v1yjw	i reported my classmate at school for looking at something inappropriate	"so in my algebra class there is this guy i sit next to it started off just like any other day and class just started and the teacher hasnt gone up to the board and started teaching the guy next to me i happened to glance at his screen and saw something inappropriate he was scrolling through photos and i saw a photo of two men holding hands and they had a condom in the middle another photo i saw there were two men were on top of each other just from where i was sitting it made me feel pretty uncomfortable it was kind of in my view and then when class ended i went up and told the teacher about what happened and what i saw and then i left to find the principal and report it

756	I exaggerated my daughters symptoms so the doctors would do tests.	I want to start by saying I don’t not have munchausen syndrome. I love my kids and I don’t want them to be sick. Anyways, my daughter started having episodes of breath holding, abnormal eye movements, and lethargic type symptoms after these episodes. The first time it happened I took her in and truthfully told them what happened. I was told “it’s probably breath holding spells. It’s pretty scary for new moms” and we were sent home. The “diagnosis” didn’t sit right with me. Over the course of a month the episodes were more frequent. Happening everyday, multiple times a day. She had an episode where it lasted 2 minutes. So I took her to the er, exaggerated the symptoms and they did additional tests (24 hr. Eeg and MRI). The tests confirmed that she in fact has epilepsy not breath holding spells.	16utgk9	i exaggerated my daughters symptoms so the doctors would do tests	i want to start by saying i dont not have munchausen syndrome i love my kids and i dont want them to be sick anyways my daughter started having episodes of breath holding abnormal eye movements and lethargic type symptoms after these episodes the first time it happened i took her in and truthfully told them what happened i was told its probably breath holding spells its pretty scary for new moms and we were sent home the diagnosis didnt sit right with me over the course of a month the episodes were more frequent happening everyday multiple times a day she had an episode where it lasted  minutes so i took her to the er exaggerated the symptoms and they did additional tests  hr eeg and mri the tests confirmed that she in fact has epilepsy not breath holding spells	utgk
757	I am an a**hole cause I posted a kid on my school IG page	"
I had school today and outside we had a rat, for some reason outside in the tables during lunch. Everyone ran but the rat was calm and waddling around. Then some random kid came up and grabbed it by it’s tail and started showing it off.

I took a photo of him holding it and I posted it to my school’s page where you take photos of classmates or random people in your school. I thought it was funny so I wanted to share it. It actually ended up getting over 166 likes and now I feel like an a*s for blasting this kid’s face all over. He is only a freshman.

I regret it because I never asked to take a photo of him and I immediately regretted it after messaging the owner of the account but once I deleted it they already screenshot the image.

I hope he doesn’t dwell on it tomorrow, I hope that photo gets buried quick by other students.

It’s an IG page where you just submit images so I cannot remove it."	16u3p1d	i am an ahole cause i posted a kid on my school ig page	"

762	I take sh*tty jobs with the intention of rage quitting.	"I never went to college, so my younger days were filled with your typical run of the mill minimum wage jobs for shifty retailers. 

Eventually through some luck and gambles I ended up starting a home business that does fairly well. I live a modest life, but I am secure and comfortable. 

My business is seasonal, so there is a part of the year where I have a lot of free time. 

Sometimes during this time I would look for a job to make some side money, but my business doesn't carry over well to anything that pays decent, and I have a huge gap on my resume aside my self employed stuff.

This ment all that was available to me, was still those shifty retail jobs. 

I actually enjoyed the work when I did it before, it was the people that were the problem, and of course, I ran into that as soon as I would start.

The thing is... I don't really need to work, or have a job, this is for recreation basically, and my 10 year ""self employed"" on my resume means, I can just not list this job in employment history, it makes 0 difference. 

So now, any time I decide to get a job for fun money, I go into it knowing im just going to work there until someone makes it not worth it, at which point I rage quit, but because I know this going in, I usually have been playing fly on the wall long enough to do some damage on my way out. 

My last manager liked to use the R word a lot and a bunch of those other things managers like to do, that they know they shouldn't, but do anyways. The store was already on thin ice, and there was a much more successful location oddly close by

So the day she pushed me too far, I called HR, let them know I was disabled and this was causing my mental health to suffer, and I needed a leave of absence.

 It takes them 30 days to approve or deny this, so during that time they are in limbo as to weather or not they can hire a replacement.

I had no intention of returning, but I drug it out and even filed for a few extentions, meaning a whole investigation was launched into WHY this was going on, I'm guessing because ""hey, we lost 1 of the 2 people who know how to price everything and it will take months to traun a replacement!"" was not something corporate was happy to hear. 

Long story short, that location no longer exists. I talked to one of the girls at the other location, and apparently, It, along with the other location that was doing well, were both struggling with being short staffed, so they just transfered the good employees over there, like 6 people got fired due to the investigation, the rest got severance packages, and they shut it down."	16tulz8	i take shtty jobs with the intention of rage quitting	"i never went to college so my younger days were filled with your typical run of the mill minimum wage jobs for shifty retailers

765	I stole a hair blow dryer from a homeless person last week	I know how it sounds but look, money has been so tight lately and I just began dating this girl who has an amazing ass and lately she's been so mad that I haven't been paying for anything when we go out I tell her I'm trying as unlike her I don't have roommates and have car payments but anyway. She was going on about how I don't have a hair blowdryer at my place and if I was nice I'd get her one. It just so happens a couple days later I saw this homeless persons cart with a whole bunch of random stuff including two hair blowdryers. I decided that there's no way this guy needs two. He was around the corner by the drive threw pan handling. I just took the nicer blowdryer and hopped in my car and drove away.

766	"I got my mom into a $11000 debt at a university that I don't ""attend."""	"My mother after I completed high school wanted me to go off to university but at the time, I lacked ambition and disappointed by my final high school results. With everything that went on in my life at the time I decided to take a gap year. As a teenager I really struggled with depression and social anxiety and sometimes would get panic attacks in public so when Covid hit it helped (as bad as that sounds) because I didn't have to socialize as much.  
  
The following year I got into university doing a course I didn't want to do but the pressure for my mom especially when she would say she worked so hard to put me through school and did it all for nothing, for me to be sitting in her house useless. That made me feel so guilty, so I went. Also because of my results I had to do a bridging course for a year which I completed with success so the following year I guess that's where things took a turn.  
  
Right through high school I would always voice out that I had serious social anxiety and deeply depressed and needed help but always constantly ignored by my family I got to the point where I was suicidal even my teacher noticed there was even a day, she took me home because she was worried and spoke to my mom about it, but nothing happened. So, going to university my mental health has just been deuterating.  
  
So, on my second year at uni things went from online learning to on campus, which was so overwhelming I couldn't even focus, I was failing, I felt like I was going crazy, and no one would understand me because I don't even understand myself. So, I ""dropped out"" as in from last year I don't attend my classes I just sit in my dorm room and do nothing. When my mom calls to check on me, I just say I'm failing or when she asks for my semester results, I just give her excuses or ignore her for which pisses her off rightfully so, whenever I need money she sends it, whenever she comes to the city she stops by and visits. I've gotten so comfortable being in my room all day and feel guilty because overall she really is the best mom who deserves high achieving exceptional and health kids.  
  
Currently she owes the university $11,000 for a useless kid and she doesn't even know it. I am taking online courses and I have started my own ecommerce store so hopefully this goes well because I no longer want to be burden or disappointment to her."	16smjhj	i got my mom into a  debt at a university that i dont attend	"my mother after i completed high school wanted me to go off to university but at the time i lacked ambition and disappointed by my final high school results with everything that went on in my life at the time i decided to take a gap year as a teenager i really struggled with depression and social anxiety and sometimes would get panic attacks in public so when covid hit it helped as bad as that sounds because i didnt have to socialize as much

767	I stole thousands of dollars from my restaurant job.	"When I bartended at an Olive Garden in college, we’d have the ability to put employee discounts on meals. 50% off.

Whenever I got tables that paid in cash, I’d discount their bill by 50% and pocket the cash. I made $400-500 a week extra from doing this. I invested all of this money, since I was living with my parents at the time.

When I graduated, I had more than enough invested to put a huge downpayment on a house, which I now live in. 

I haven’t stolen anything since."	16sd1np	i stole thousands of dollars from my restaurant job	"when i bartended at an olive garden in college wed have the ability to put employee discounts on meals  off

768	Its hard for me to have integrity or be moral, I often break rules	"I have noticed a pattern in my life. I have little regard for things like lying (about significant things) cheating in school, and recently: filling a water cup with a fountain drink. 

The reason I am even writing this is because today I filled a water cup up with a fountain drink which is obviously not allowed, I ended up getting caught to which the manager or owner of the joint scolded the worker who gave me the cup. I felt bad of course and I payed afterwards because I felt bad for her….. but the problem is I dont really feel bad that I filled the cup up with a fountain drink…in fact im annoyed that he made such a big fuss since in my mind, most people do this.  i think he is overreacting…. even when others might say Im the one who’s stealing. Anyway the whole thing just stuck into my mind and I went on thinking about the other areas where I have lacked integrity. 

I don’t ACTIVELY cheat on everything, in fact I work very hard to get good marks in what im interested in, but if its something I hate or suck at, I cheat and I guess thats just not moral of me. Yet, behind my consciousness, I dont feel bad in that circumstance , because afterall i hate the subject and i am usually ‘required’ to take it. 

I used to also steal from stores when I was a teenager, and I remember thinking that there is no reason to feel bad, that you should only feel bad if its a person youre stealing from. 

 I also have a hard time following rules…. Its not necessarily intentional but I so easily deem many rules are “silly” that I blatantly stop following them… there are countless things I did in addition to this hence the title , and i dont know why I am this way. 

My EARLIEST memory is lying in elementary school about selling things from a catalog and getting rubber duck rewards. I got caught there too, after like a month and had to return this giant keychain of rubber duck i collected ….Lol .. it was so embarrassing for me and yet ive never thought to stop my behavior since then. I think I want to take shortcuts and do things the “easy” way which is why many adults have disliked me even to this day, as I am in my 20s."	16s90fg	its hard for me to have integrity or be moral i often break rules	"i have noticed a pattern in my life i have little regard for things like lying about significant things cheating in school and recently filling a water cup with a fountain drink

769	I cut into a funeral procession on the road to get onto the highway the other day	"OKAY FIRST OFF when did funeral processions stop with the little flags on the cars? I grew up immediately able to recognize a funeral procession because there would be a line of cars driving really slowly, all with the little orange or black flags, following the hearse. Like you immediately knew and you immediately respected that hey… this is part of a funeral, don’t be a dick. 

But no I guess they don’t do that anymore? Or I’m in the south now and maybe they just don’t do that here? 

I’m driving home from work and decided to take this little side route to cut through 3 exits of traffic, then merge back on the highway. It usually saves me about 5-10 minutes and so it’s just a habit at this point. I turn onto the road that’s going to take me back on the highway and I see the car in front of me with hazards on so I’m immediately like scuuuurp and get over into the passing lane. Then I see the next car in front of them has their hazards on going really slow and I’m like well that’s weird, there must be something in the road… so I’m going a little slower but still going the speed limit. I look up the road and just see a loooong line of cars all with hazards on and I don’t know why “funeral procession” didn’t cross my mind until I’m cutting back into the lane, 2 cars behind the hearse, to get back on the highway. 

I can only imagine what was going through everyone’s head as I completely disrespectfully zipped through a funeral procession…. but CAN WE BE REAL HERE? WHY WERE THERE NO FLAGS?

770	I regret drinking and driving I own up to my mistake	About a week ago I was drinking and driving. I’m happy no one got hurt or killed by my stupid mistake, I just hit the curb and just did damage to my car. It sure is costing me money. I hate it because I barley go out, and barley drink as it is. I still feel guilty, never again. My life just sucks too right now, I’ve been working so hard lately trying to build my family out of poverty working 12 hour shifts 6 days a week just to make a mistake like this… I feel  little depressed too. I still live with my kids father who I left a few months ago . I’m trying to keep the peace by not just throwing him out but he still not out of here then he just lost his job so it’s not like he can leave without money.

771	My grandfather ate a whole can of Pringle’s that I had licked	"My grandpa bought a can of chili lime Pringle’s and had told me he didn’t really care for the flavor. In my thirteen year old brain, that translated to “you can have the rest of these” but I was on some sort of a weight loss journey at the time and ended up just licking the seasoning off of all the chips and stacking them back in the can to come back for later (super gross, I know) so I put the can back in the cupboard with the full intention of eating them the next day. Well, I get home from school the next day and head over to the cupboard for my afternoon snack and to my absolute shock and horror, I find the empty can sitting at the top of the trash bag. 

Me and my grandfather were the only people living in the house at the time.

772	I had an assignment for class and ended up doing part of it while driving	"I have to go into work soon so I don’t have much time. The other day I had a late paper for class and didn’t want it to be any later so I tried to type it out whenever I’d get to a red light or a stop sign. However, without noticing I gradually began to keep working on the assignment while I was pulling into the stop signs and red lights, and eventually when I realized that I was doing it while driving, I completely dropped my phone and drove in silence. 

I have a bad habit of looking down at it if something goes wrong with my music or something, primarily when I’m pulling into stops because I guess my brain sees it as less bad. Pretty much my entire family does the same thing, but it feels so wrong at the same time to drive without music, and I’m worried without it I’d end up making more mistakes in the tedium. Regardless I’m glad I learned this at 19 so I can try to fix it, but the fact that I’m still struggling makes me feel bad.

A group of us would go checking if the mail slot was open.....Oh boy when we found one, one of us would cut the power while the other lit smoke bombs and thru em in the house and at the side door and hauled ass.

774	I fooled around with someone while we were both drunk	"Back in High School I went to a party and got drunk for the first time. I hadn’t been the party type, never got into trouble and wanted to relieve stress before jumping into college. At some point I was told that there was a train going on in a room and figured I’d jump in to finally have sex 

As I went into the room I saw it was just one other guy but in my opinion I thought it was just one at a time in the room or something. Anyways I go in and we fool around for a bit 

————————————————————————

THE SEX


For context the room was dark so while I know for certain she knew it’s a different guy coming in I’m not entirely sure if she saw my face 

What transpired was something that was less than 10 minutes. She’s kissing my body but I don’t want to kiss back, she tries giving me head but keeps biting my dick, and she lays down saying to fuck me n****

Now before I can even get a condom on correctly she says fuck me (friend’s name)

This was another black guy who looks nothing like me but who I was with at the party. It was then I knew I couldn’t continue with this and started to put my pants back on 

Right as I’m putting my belt on her friend comes into the room as she’s worried and I leave them alone.

————————————————————————

THE MORNING

Because I was drunk I didn’t bother driving and ended up staying the whole night. We came across each other in the kitchen and when I asked her about the other night she stated that I did nothing wrong and that she was fine. Nevertheless I’ve felt guilty since and feel as if I’ve SA’d her regardless  

————————————————————————

PRESENT DAY

It’s been years since and I feel like I need to own up to a crime even though we were both drunk and she told me I did nothing wrong. I messaged her on FB summarizing all this and saying she can decide where to go from here. I’m remorseful but still curious as to whether this constitutes SA or not"	16pq6vq	i fooled around with someone while we were both drunk	"back in high school i went to a party and got drunk for the first time i hadnt been the party type never got into trouble and wanted to relieve stress before jumping into college at some point i was told that there was a train going on in a room and figured id jump in to finally have sex

775	Faked an upset stomach to leave work early to save my sanity	"Hear me out. Yes, it was wrong. Did tell my line managers the truth that I was faking. 

Started a new job, taking over from someone retiring. Was one on one with them today in the office. After several hours of the same old same old how amazing he is at his job, no one else does their job properly and watching him one finger type for half an hour, was close to tears. I ask a question and it creates a torrent of how amazing he is, how no one does their job and the information is in the file. So learned to smile and nod at them. Which only works for soo long until a long winded repeat of how amazing he is and how no one else does their jobs.  Repeated the same information in 7 varieties of phrases and words, acknowledges I know it and then repeats it in another variety of phrases and words and how amazing they are and no one else does their job.

Have found several mistakes of his but if mention them to him, he says its doesnt matter who made the mistakes, just sort them out. Email him about his mistakes and it creates another avenue about something else of how amazing he is and no else does their jobs.

Started panic running to the loo and hiding in there for 10 minutes to save my sanity. Phoned my line managers and they totally understand. Now counting down the days till the amazing one who is the only one who does his job properly retires.

777	probably not going to get this job because i provided a fake reference	"So I got a job offer recently... and after I was offered the job, HR required me to give 5 references to email them a long survey.

I was able to get 4 references, still waiting on one to do the survey... I stupidly did the last reference myself under a fake email, using the name of a former manager that probably doesn't remember me. I was desperate and frustrated, but that's no excuse. Now I'm probably not going to get this job, I'm sure they'll be able to find out what I did. I have no one to blame but myself. Don't lecture me 'cause I've already lectured myself.

779	I touched multiple girls inappropriately when I was in middle school and early high school.	"For quick context, I(now 32M) had pretty difficult childhood. Large family, untreated Adhd, bullied and targeted by my own siblings my whole childhood, emotionally neglected, and ostracized. Knowing what I know now, I was clearly in severe need of mental health care and therapy as I clearly had reactive attachment disorder on top of the untreated adhd. My siblings locked me in the snow for hours, would attack me and harass me and then I would deal with the same things at an extremely small school (300 students Pre K - 12th). Even knowing what I know now I still lay in bed some nights so angry and ashamed of myself. When I was 15, I had no control of my anger or emotions and so people avoided me. Then, a group of guys started talking to me one day. They pointed out a girl in our class who was known for dating around. I don't know how they convinced me, but they convinced me to walk over and grab her butt. One of them did it first to ""show me it was okay""... so I did. She laughed it off and told me not to do it again... but the guys laughed and told me she ""was just saying that"".. so I did it again later, I don't know if I was looking for their attention or I was just so over sexualized and lonely, but it went on for so long, it happened so many times and she so clearly wasnt okay with it.. then one day in weight class the girl I had a crush on let one of the guys touch her breast for God knows what reason.. so impulsively I reached up and did the same.. but worst of all there was a group of siblings my parent babysat... one of them was not much younger than me, but in teen years even a year is considered a long time.. one day we were swimming and i was tossing them around the pool and wrestling and I realized I was getting ""excited""... I took advantage of the ""wrestling"". It was never under clothes, and it never went past touching... but to me that doesn't make it any less awful that I would do that. I just lay here some nights and these intrusive thoughts pop up like ""remember that time you just did these things to these girls?"" and I get so angry. I pray that she never realized I did that and that I didn't scar her because I was such an awful person.. but even still... anytime I feel like I'm doing good, and I've overcome my past... these memories haunt me and tear me back down...


Edit for clarifications sake and accountability: 
    So for starters. I think the main feedback I am seeing are the  comments about my adhd, other disorders, and the story of the guys. My intent was not to try and use those as ""fluff"" or a crutch.. I over communicate and have had posts on other subreddits taken down for being too long. So I didn't want that to happen and I obviously didn't explain my own perceptions to things properly. 
    My mental health issues are not my fault but they are my responsibility. The choices I made to assault these girls was still a choice I made to chase my own lustful desires and satisfaction with no consideration of them. The ""other guys"" encouraged me the 1st time it happened and with one girl. they did not play any part in it from then on except as witnesses and played no part in the other two girls I victimized... I think my state of mind was looking to it as a road map. Two things can be true at once, first that my life was difficult and thus there were many of Maslows hierarchy of needs that I did not recieve. Second that it does not excuse my behavior or justify it in anyway. But in my studies of psychology I've come across a common thread of seeking the ""purpose behind the behavior"". So I guess my quick typing without context came off as justifying, but that was not my intent nor my feelings on the matter.  

2nd. I want to apologize for not having the foresight to place a trigger warning for anyone else who has been victimized in the past or effected by actions such as this. It DOES NOT bring me any comfort to see other posts about how common this is. My hope for this post was not to hear other horror stories about this being a normal male behavior. I have been in therapy a few different times, however the times I have gone into therapy has felt directionless. Even still, therapist are trained to be unjudgmental, to remain impartial and unmoved. I posted this to get real, true responses. So thank you. 

To those who have offered words of support and understanding. Thank you for showing me that there are people out there who will understand that I strive everyday to get as far away from the person I was as I can. That I am not that person anymore and never will be again. This was what I needed, to know that others could see past who I was and understand that I despise who I was. That I could still be seen as a person by real people and not just a therapist in a chair being paid to convince me i am a person... 

To those who were critical and correcting. Thank you. I learned a while back the value of criticism. Having real people provide insight into these things helps to identify blind spots and mistakes.

To those who were raw. I appreciate your feedback. I understand there's nothing I can ever do to make it right. I can't take away the things that I did regardless of age or circumstances. I am not seeking any forgiveness or get out of jail free card. I am not try to manipulate people to coddle me or tell me what I did ""wasn't a big deal"" or ""normal"". I recognized my failures, my desire to be a better person is not dependent on anyone's forgiveness of ANY mistakes I've made past present or future. I want to be better because I recognized how horrible and disgusting the things I did was and how much hurt and trauma I could have (and as others pointed out) likely did cause. If someone is truly remorseful, they will change with or without forgiveness or acceptance, because it whats right. I can promise you that I will never be that person again, and I will continue doing everything I can to advocate against these behaviors."	16nebzf	i touched multiple girls inappropriately when i was in middle school and early high school	"for quick context inow m had pretty difficult childhood large family untreated adhd bullied and targeted by my own siblings my whole childhood emotionally neglected and ostracized knowing what i know now i was clearly in severe need of mental health care and therapy as i clearly had reactive attachment disorder on top of the untreated adhd my siblings locked me in the snow for hours would attack me and harass me and then i would deal with the same things at an extremely small school  students pre k  th even knowing what i know now i still lay in bed some nights so angry and ashamed of myself when i was  i had no control of my anger or emotions and so people avoided me then a group of guys started talking to me one day they pointed out a girl in our class who was known for dating around i dont know how they convinced me but they convinced me to walk over and grab her butt one of them did it first to show me it was okay so i did she laughed it off and told me not to do it again but the guys laughed and told me she was just saying that so i did it again later i dont know if i was looking for their attention or i was just so over sexualized and lonely but it went on for so long it happened so many times and she so clearly wasnt okay with it then one day in weight class the girl i had a crush on let one of the guys touch her breast for god knows what reason so impulsively i reached up and did the same but worst of all there was a group of siblings my parent babysat one of them was not much younger than me but in teen years even a year is considered a long time one day we were swimming and i was tossing them around the pool and wrestling and i realized i was getting excited i took advantage of the wrestling it was never under clothes and it never went past touching but to me that doesnt make it any less awful that i would do that i just lay here some nights and these intrusive thoughts pop up like remember that time you just did these things to these girls and i get so angry i pray that she never realized i did that and that i didnt scar her because i was such an awful person but even still anytime i feel like im doing good and ive overcome my past these memories haunt me and tear me back down

780	I backed into someone at a grocery store parking lot and left.	Okay. It sounds worse than it is but I haven’t told anyone this and need to get it out. When I first moved in with my bf I was using his truck for awhile. I went to the store to get groceries while he was at work so I could cook dinner later that night. And while parking, I backed into someone. It was a newer truck that was a little bigger than my bf’s but luckily it was just a little tap. Obviously enough to feel it, but it didn’t damage anything on my bf’s truck, or the other persons truck and the other person wasn’t around so I just sat in the drivers seat shaking for a good ten minutes and then went into the store like nothing happened. Still think about it anytime I park.	16mug3k	i backed into someone at a grocery store parking lot and left	okay it sounds worse than it is but i havent told anyone this and need to get it out when i first moved in with my bf i was using his truck for awhile i went to the store to get groceries while he was at work so i could cook dinner later that night and while parking i backed into someone it was a newer truck that was a little bigger than my bfs but luckily it was just a little tap obviously enough to feel it but it didnt damage anything on my bfs truck or the other persons truck and the other person wasnt around so i just sat in the drivers seat shaking for a good ten minutes and then went into the store like nothing happened still think about it anytime i park	mugk
781	Freshman year of Highschool I broke in after-hours and stole food from the concession stand.	"Very silly story incoming. My friend's mom was supposed to pick me up from school at 3:15, but she didn't remember to set an alarm. She leaves without me and I'm left alone at my school. About an hour passes and I'm starting to get hungry. Nobody else was on campus at the time so I decided to wander for a bit. I saw a vending machine but I didn't have any money, so I tried reaching under the opening with no success. It was about 5 at that point and I was really starting to get hungry. I walked back to the parking lot to see if I could squeeze through a fence leading to the football field. I knew there were bathrooms near there so I was relieved when I made it through a gap in the fence. The only restroom that was unlocked was the women's restroom, which felt wrong at the time, but I HAD to go. Once I was done with that, I looked everywhere for an idea of where to go to get something to eat. I found a small building with garage-like door on the outside, so I tried opening them. I somehow pried one door open with a bit of a struggle, and threw my backpack in so I could squeeze through. I didn't truly know where I was, but once I was inside I asked for help, just incase if anyone was in there I wouldn't look as suspicious crawling through a window. Nobody was in there, so I looked around and saw sodas and candies all around me. I was very happy. I remember voraciously stuffing my backpack with sodas labeled for pom or something like that. I'm ashamed to admit that I crammed as much soda into my backpack as humanly possible, and when I was done with that I started feasting in the dark room like that gif of the mouse eating the m&m. Eventually I'm satisfied with my haul, and I make my way out the same way I came in. I squeeze back through the gap in the fence and walk back to campus. It's about 7pm now and football practice had started. I got spotted by some kind dad, and he let me use his phone to call my mom and tell her I was still at school. She got to my school as soon as she was done talking to her client and she picked me up. 

I'm sorry if this was long I didn't really realize.

782	I burned the communal field in my neighbourhood when I was 12	When I was 12 my cousins and I, decided to make a bonfire at the pond near my house for no reason. Being the stupid kids that we were, the surrounding dead grass / weeds quickly caught flame and the whole field by said pond starting burning out. I tried to pee on the engulfing flames but it’s pretty hard to go when you’re extremely anxious by an ongoing fire with pedestrians headed your way. My cousins and I decided to run away and by some luck we never got caught. Walked back over the next day and 4 acres of land was burnt to dust.	16m869c	i burned the communal field in my neighbourhood when i was 	when i was  my cousins and i decided to make a bonfire at the pond near my house for no reason being the stupid kids that we were the surrounding dead grass  weeds quickly caught flame and the whole field by said pond starting burning out i tried to pee on the engulfing flames but its pretty hard to go when youre extremely anxious by an ongoing fire with pedestrians headed your way my cousins and i decided to run away and by some luck we never got caught walked back over the next day and  acres of land was burnt to dust	mc

786	"I used to do ""Doormat Switcheroos"" to my apartment neighbors"	"When I was a tween, like say 11-12 years old, I lived in the fourth floor of a musty apartment. A lot of people had doormats despite their being a carpet in the hallways of the apartments. Anyway, I thought to myself one day, ""Hey, what if I just switched the doormats around?""   
So I did. I just grabbed two neighbor's doormats and swapped places with eachother to fuck with them. And I kept doing it.   
After they put their doormats back, I took them and swapped them around with other people's doormats. Sometimes I would take their doormat and place it in front of some random spot in the hallway, not even in front of a door or I would hide it in the stairwell.  
I kind of regret that because one of the poor victims was a neighbor of mine that I like, and also because it's kind of just stupid. I would be a little bit confused if my doormat kept switching places or disappearing, especially because those things are just overly expensive for no reason.  
Also because I would do that and not even wash my hands afterwards. Like yeah, good going 11 year old me, put your grubby hands on a surface that has been stepped on by a hundred dirty muddy shoes and then not wash your hands afterwards.

A friend passed back in December. Some of the band's songs reminded me of him. The sadness turned to anger after a few moments of choking back tears and I just let it rip. 

The reason I feel guilty is because I was too much a coward to make my way back to where the pit was already in motion, so I may have sullied the night for a number of individuals.

789	I stole money from my workplace for 4 years straight.	"Across my 4 years at university, I worked as a waiter at a chain of restaurants. The owner was an asshole and only kept me because I was willing to work late shifts. He had a reputation for sexually harassing employees. 

Everyday, I would mess with a few cash transactions and pocket the difference. 

For example, if a customers bill was £30, I would take £30 from the customer and then remove a few items which reduces the bills total. The new total would be £20, and as far as the POS (system) was aware, the £20 bill was successfully closed with £20 in cash. I pocketed the £10 difference. 

I did this a few times a day, 4 days a week. I would pocket approx £500 a month which adds up over 4 years. Because I cashed up, I was able to ensure there was no suspicious transactions or issues. 

I was never caught on camera as the till was above a shelf where we kept personal belongings. This meant it was easy to leave the money around and then stash it into my bag or jacket across the day. 

If I ever did get caught, my plan was to blackmail my manager as I had evidence of his sexual harassment in the form of WhatsApp message screenshots sent to me from female colleagues. I would threaten to tell his wife too. 

FYI I was not stealing from the customer, they were always charged correctly. I stole from the restaurant. In fact, I would give customers insane discounts if they were decent with me."	16igvge	i stole money from my workplace for  years straight	"across my  years at university i worked as a waiter at a chain of restaurants the owner was an asshole and only kept me because i was willing to work late shifts he had a reputation for sexually harassing employees

790	It was me that moved your Garden Gnome every night	"When I (42M) was in my twenties, I worked in a nightclub and used to walk home with a couple of co-workers pretty much every night at roughly 3am. on the way home there was this one Garden that was always perfect, it had a little pond with a Gnome (one of those that has a fishing pole, you know the type right?) Well, one night we decided it would be fun to move said gnome to a neighbors' garden. (no damage, we were not heathens lol)

The next night, said gnome was back in its place as if nothing had happened, so of course we moved it again, to a different neighbors garden, and we continued to do this every time we walked home (normally at least 4 or 5 times a week) for the next 6-8 months or so. I hope we didn't annoy you too much and you took it in the spirit it was meant!! It always made us smile to see him back in his original place!

791	I broke your spiderman action figure in kindergarten	"I didn’t tell anyone this. The amount of guilt, shame and fear overcame my tiny body when it happened and I refused to ever tell a soul. 

You knew me from the first year in kindergarten. We instantly became best friends. You were just as insane and uncontrollable as me. We had so many things in common. It was as if we were brother and sister. We went to each other’s birthday parties  and would have that one absolute obsession. Spiderman. Everything had to be spiderman themed for us. Backpacks, lunchboxes, drinking bottles, everything…

Until the day you announced on the playground that you had this new spiderman action figure. Since we couldn’t be in the hallways by ourselves and everybody’s backpack was there, you could only invite your 2 closest friends to sneak into the hallway and show them your brand new spiderman figurine. 

Everybody was amazed. The adrenaline from being somewhere we shouldn’t have been, combined with the excitement of seeing you sneak out your toy out of your backpack was way too much for 4-5 year olds. You showed it so proudly. You showed how it could circle it’s arms and legs almost 360° in every way. We were impressed but than those malicious thoughts came up when you said we couldn’t touch it. You didn’t trust us. Your closest friends. You couldn’t… and rightfully so. I wouldn’t want to take any chance either of someone potentially breaking my beloved toy… 

So when you and the 2 others who came with you decided to get in a random classroom to feed your curiosity, I decided to feed mine. 

Your backpack stood there, shining and whispering to me to open it. And as I did, there he was. Tobey Maguire’s Peter Parker laying loosely on your Peter Parker lunchbox. 

The immense power took over me and with a beastly lust, I carefully took him out of his prison and had to know how you felt when you almost spun his armes and legs around 360°. 

Almost, as I repeat. Cause I felt the figurine internally scream from misery. The limbs felt loose all of the sudden and when I saw the little bits of plastic coming from it, I panicked. I felt my blood draw away from my face and could hear you coming back with your other friends. 

I put Peter back into your backpack, right on your lunchbox and made it look like his limbs were still attached to it’s body. I didn’t wanted to make it look like I did it so I ran to the other door before you and the others could see me. 

The only thing I remembered was your saddened voice when you discovered that your beloved toy was broken. You never suspected my selfish persona and blamed it on your poor self. The immense feel of guilt, shame and fear made me become a bad liar and a goody 2 shoes. 

I am so sorry for breaking your spiderman figurine, Killian."	16hyhvy	i broke your spiderman action figure in kindergarten	"i didnt tell anyone this the amount of guilt shame and fear overcame my tiny body when it happened and i refused to ever tell a soul

792	About 20 years ago I threw a tire in the road that resulted in an accident	"I was 5 or 6 don't remember much, we used to collect old tires from this dumpster and play with them when we get bored we go the highest point on the side of the road and let them go, this side has some trees and at the end this 1m wall  with a sidewalk that sperates it from the road some tires manage to jump and some don't make it. We never once managed to hit any cars.

One day I was alone it was around 4 pm nobody was outside so I decided to throw this tire im playing with I went to the side of the road I remember I couldn't threw it cause it was heavy so I just let it slide, it gained momonetum and jumped to the road straight into a maruti with force and another car that was behind the maruti stopped and was hit from behind by another car don't remember if it lost balance but the maruti that was first crashed in the road divider and everything went to shit. I was shaking decided to run away and hid on top of a tree far from that location don't remember for how long, then I went home and was lucky nobody saw me. I never told anyone and to this day I feel very guilty

EDIT : If anyone would wonder why would I even do this, seeing cars evading tires made me laugh hysterically like laugh non stop even lying on the ground out loud.

793	I stole money from my parents as a grown ass woman	"I don’t know why I did it, Already in the process of signing up for therapy. I moved back in with my parents this past year since I could not find work in my field in my city after months of daily job searching.

I was drunk the other afternoon and took a $50 bill from my mothers wallet. I remember being so confident about it. I spent it on gas to go for a drive(while sober). I was so full of guilt the next day and replaced it. But I don’t know wtf came over me. I’ve never intentionally stolen from anything but stores before (from a bad depression and cry for attention when I was a teenager but no one even ever found out. It was one tube top and a couple makeup pencils over the course of years).

Going to talk about with my therapist once I can get my insurance reapproved. But I am currently so disgusted with myself I needed to vent."	16hex8z	i stole money from my parents as a grown ass woman	"i dont know why i did it already in the process of signing up for therapy i moved back in with my parents this past year since i could not find work in my field in my city after months of daily job searching

794	I technically stole money from my sister for Robux.	So I love roblox, let me get that straight, I've played for over 7 years and only first got Robux around 3 years ago, I got it from my friend who wanted me to have some, good, it's free, I'll take it. A few years go by, and I buy a gift card when I have the chance, but my sister offered me a 10 dollar gift card if I buy her a 20 dollar gift card, so I did. A week or so later (a few days ago at the time of posting) I ask her if she wants more robux, I say give me 30$ and I will. She does, she says this time I can have the 20$ one, and I go to the store, buy the cards, and get home. Then I used both the cards to buy this item. I lied and told her it must've fallen out of my pocket on the way home, (I rode my bike) and she believed it and hasn't mentioned it since. I feel bad for doing this.	16h4eoz	i technically stole money from my sister for robux	so i love roblox let me get that straight ive played for over  years and only first got robux around  years ago i got it from my friend who wanted me to have some good its free ill take it a few years go by and i buy a gift card when i have the chance but my sister offered me a  dollar gift card if i buy her a  dollar gift card so i did a week or so later a few days ago at the time of posting i ask her if she wants more robux i say give me  and i will she does she says this time i can have the  one and i go to the store buy the cards and get home then i used both the cards to buy this item i lied and told her it mustve fallen out of my pocket on the way home i rode my bike and she believed it and hasnt mentioned it since i feel bad for doing this	heoz
795	I have been lying to my parents about university classes	"For the last while I have been lying to my parents about how many university classes I have been taking.

Some context before I tell the story. I am the ""disappointment child"". For years I have been living in my brothers shadow. My older brother (3 years older) is extremely gifted and is really good at sports/ school/ people. I am not. That's not to say I am not smart I still get like b+/ A grades but my brother was the kid to get like 95+%. He has been in several relationships I have only been in one. They take anytime to sing his praises and almost never do the same for me. You get the point. So my stricter parent have always favored him even though they won't admit it. Any time I try to bring it up they shut me down saying the ""We love both our children equally"". 

Story time: I have recently entered university in a pretty difficult course: Civil Engineering. Because I have a job and am doing a hard Uni course I decided to drop 2 of my 6 classes. So when it came time to tell my parents I sent them a email explaining. But somehow, I don't understand how, they thought I was **ADDING** two courses instead of dropping them. So the next day they called me up  congratulating and praising me. (They almost never have done this with me). This is a rare time i feel like they are proud of me. I really enjoy the feeling of my parents actually being proud of me. And I don't want to go back to being a disappointment so I've been lying to them. For the last month they have thought I was taking 8 classes instead of the 4 I'm actually taking. And because my parents are a bit controlling even thought i no longer live with them. They still want updates on how I'm doing.  I feel bad for lying to them.

796	My old company collapsed and so I kept my old work laptop and reset it for personal use	"My old company essentially collapsed. No one I knew when I was a remote contractor there is currently employed. It's basically a shell of a workplace and has been for several months. 

I recently found the box with my work laptop in my home. I was supposed to have sent it back to them after my contract ended and the company hadn't hired me as staff -- my bad! I honestly thought I had and I just completely forgot. I had also gotten quite sick around that time and so it slipped my mind and was moved around by my mom who had come to help me recover.

The address on the prepaid package to send the laptop is...empty. No one works in that building anymore. So, I just reset it to factory settings and going to use it as a personal laptop.

Edit to add: Thanks all! Times are tough and I'm slowly becoming ok with sticking it to the new owner of the company who gutted it. Now it's a matter of actually figuring out how to properly reset it....

799	I lied about getting a degree. And now I'm too deep in.	"F 27

This is something I never told my friend, family, or boyfriend. I never verbalized this or even wrote it down before. But it's killing me inside

I live in a European country, a normal bachelor's degree takes 6 semesters (3 years). It's free; besides administration fees, you pay quarterly. And I haven't paid the fees for the next semester and am about to get kicked out... Let me start at the beginning.

When it came to getting into a course, I didn't get into anything I wanted because my grades were that terrible. It's actually a secret in itself because everyone assumed my grades were top, because I don't belong to the dump kind I guess? I was always a child prodigy: 
Got into school two years earlier than normal and skipped a class. But by the time I became a teenager, I was deeply depressed and had a lot of social anxiety, to the point that simple interactions were too much to handle for me. I would never go to school, and it reflected in my grades. They weren't bad, but they also ain't that good either. I actually had to redo my final year. My teenage self didn't have many options, so she picked the most random subject that didn't require numerous clauses and ended up in Experimental Physics. 

I would have walked out the first day, if I didn't meet some of my school friends. We became study buddies and everything went fine until my depressions kicked in. I got put into a psychiatric ward for half a year and once I got back they moved on, and I didn't pass one exam. It had been over 6 years ago, and I never bounced back. I start feeling big imposter syndrome and start telling myself that I'm not smart enough to do that. The fact that we were only 4 girls at the beginning and the others had already dipped out, didn't help my case. Because it left me isolated and with some weird kind of pride, that I needed to make it, in this man dominated field. Sexism within nerd groups exists... It's a real thing. They mocked me and told me I should go back to do something with kids, like normal women do. I was quite female presenting, with mini skirts and nails, and they had a lot to say about that.

I got even more depressed what made it impossible for me to get out the bed, but then the pandemic hit, I know it's inappropriate to say that, but it was a blessing in disguise. I didn't have to leave my bed to go to university and study. Furthermore, I could do right that and be alright. But my imposter syndrome kicked in again. I have zero confidence in myself. When the exam season came around, I had so much anxiety that I never went or wrote one. It's not that I don't get it, I'm simply too scared to fail and prove everyone right.


ATP I didn't want to study anymore, but everyone around me was so proud and told everyone that I'm gonna be in Physics. I'm a Desi, and it's quite important in our culture to not embarrass your family and to not be a bad example for everyone who comes after you. Academics were really important in our house and saving your face too.  I didn't want to make people talk and call me stupid. It's enough if I do it all the time, and my classmates too. But everyone starts to notice and asking me why I'm still on my bachelor's degree, so I started to lie that I'm in my masters, what put me into way more complicated situations. 


I'm not stupid, I know that. I'm became so depressed that life doesn't function anymore. And if anyone is wondering why I don't get help, I do. I have weekly therapy sessions for years. But every time I climb out of the darkness, something hits me and I fall back. I'm actually quite endangered because of everything, you know what I mean? I started to have the mentality that I rather drop die than explaining anything to anyone. Not only that, but I'm too deep into this lie, I can't back out and tell people the truth. 

I wouldn't go to my courses, because I was embarrassed that I'm still sitting in all of them with these 17-year-old and having the professors looking at me in disgust is something that I can't handle in general. They didn't like me in the first place, because I'm an immigrant, didn't do my best, wasn't smart enough to understand mathematics like that and what I felt the most, because I'm a woman and in a field that is not conventionally picked by women. 

 Since I was a child I always wanted to end up in science or ingenuity, I wanted to inspire little girls to follow their interests like I had at the beginning. It's prolly quite Barbie, but I always wanted to tell the girls that everything is possible and that you shouldn't be limited by gender expectation that had been put on you. I always lived my life like that, from climbing up the tree's with the boys to playing American football all my teenage years. It's not that I thought that I'm something special, or not like the other girls. Because I am, I developed at a very young age my understanding of feminism it has evolved since then, but I could have never accepted to be defeated by a guy's field. And on a different note, by myself.

**Anyways my confession is, that I never got one Credit Point in my 6 years of being in university.**

Edit: I don't want sympathy or sum, I'm completely aware of the fact that my personal actions or lack of, got me into this situation. I just wanted to get it off my chest, just once. Just tell someone, because it has been nearly 6 years and I couldn't tell anyone not even my therapist."	16chjmn	i lied about getting a degree and now im too deep in	"f

I literally bought over $50 worth of other stuff at the supermarket and was at the self-checkout staring into my bad with this crumpled up, plastic wrapped, soup for one powder thinking ""This is the moment of truth. If I pull this sashay out of my bag I'll have to pay for it, and if I don't, I'll be a criminal...""

It's been 2 months now and I still haven't eaten the soup. That soup isn't mine. I didn't earn it. Eating it would be admitting guilt to my crimes. Eating it would be tampering with evidence which is an even bigger crime... it'll just have to sit in my pantry until the day I die."	16bb219	i shoplifted yes im aware its not that exciting	"honestly its stupid i even feel a compulsion to confess since it was just a  sashay of soup powder from the supermarket but my religious upbringing makes this seem extremally rebellious to me and i feel drunk with power

Well I soon learned that I had accidentally permanently saved her card into my account so I slowly began using her card once in a while to get my sister and I food without her knowledge, our mom knows we did it once because I felt guilty and needed to spill the beans to someone.
My mom never told her because we knew she had stolen from our home a couple times, some worth a good chunk of money, like various groceries, she even stole cutlery a few times. 
I used to feel bad but eventually it just became a habit so I don’t even care anymore, mostly because they broke our clothing dryer and my mom had to pay $1,500 for a brand new one. 

So that’s my confession. I may be a kleptomaniac but I think she deserves it."	16b4pzv	ive been stealing money from my sisters babysitter	"so basically when me and my sister were younger we had a very old babysitter i hated her with the life of me

803	Stole from work for many years, was a problem drinker	I worked as a bar manager for over ten years, I stole from my different workplaces for many years by « shrinking » the till. The stolen money would then be used to buy useless shit that I didn’t need. It became something I had mad anxiety and guilt about all the time but I couldn’t stop myself. I also accrued a bad drinking habit. A deathly spiral of doom. When I was eventually let go for starting a fight drunk it was nearly a godsend taking into consideration the consequences if I had been caught stealing. The guilt and shame will follow me forever. I am completely sober since and do not steal and have a quick conversation everyday with whoever is up there to try and be a better man.	16alugf	stole from work for many years was a problem drinker	i worked as a bar manager for over ten years i stole from my different workplaces for many years by  shrinking  the till the stolen money would then be used to buy useless shit that i didnt need it became something i had mad anxiety and guilt about all the time but i couldnt stop myself i also accrued a bad drinking habit a deathly spiral of doom when i was eventually let go for starting a fight drunk it was nearly a godsend taking into consideration the consequences if i had been caught stealing the guilt and shame will follow me forever i am completely sober since and do not steal and have a quick conversation everyday with whoever is up there to try and be a better man	alugf
804	When I was 17, I did a hit and run and the fled the scene	"So back when I was 17, I had my learners and my girlfriend at the time asked me to go pick her something up from the store.  It was later at night around 10pm, and I headed out.  I hadn’t been to this place often to my bearings were off as to whether it was on the left or the right side of the road.

Now the road is two lane both directions.  I was on the inside (left) lane.  I was looking for the store when I noticed it at the last second.  I swerved my car over at the last minute to get into the right lane and make a turn into the store, when suddenly the front end of my car slammed into a darker coloured car in the right lane.  I never noticed them.  I wasn’t paying attention.  I put on my four ways and pulled behind him.  Just then he entered into a parking lot (probably to exchange information, i’ll never know).  Now the parking lot is set up so the entrance and exit are not the same, so you’d have to drive around the lot in order to exit.

As soon as he pulled into the lot, a voice in my head just said “go”.  I slammed on the gas while he was still pulling in and floored it down the street.  I got to a residential area and went even further into it before shutting off my car and the lights and sat there in silence.  I thought to myself “what have I done?”  I had just turned a fender bender into a hit and run AND I just fled the scene.  I tried to figure out what to do.  Do I go back, or do I leave.  Being an idiotic 17 year old, I fled completely.  I knew I was screwed if I went back and I’d probably lose my license, and if I didn’t, insurance would be so high I may as well have lost it.

I went home and switched the story around and told my parents how I was the one who was hit and the other driver did a hit and run and fled the scene.  My girlfriends dad had a friend who was a mechanic.  He buffed off the other paint and fixed my bumper with zip ties (he offered to get me the parts cheap but I was paranoid that they’d be able to trace the parts back to me, so I declined)

I never filed an accident report, but told my parent I did.  Shortly after this I got rid of the car and bought another used car from my moms friend.   I wanted it to never be traced back to me.  I took it to the junk yard myself to make sure it would be destroyed.

No one ever found out what I did.  I’ve never said anything to anyone.  This happened 15 years ago, and I still feel immense guilt from it.  I can imagine how much of a pain insurance must have been for that person, but I was a terrified novice driver.

805	I assaulted someone 9 years ago as a teenager - unbearable guilt	"When I  \[23f\] was 14 and in my freshman year of high school, I went to a party at my friends house, where we all were drinking. In the morning, as my friends and I were retelling what we remembered from the night, this boy, who I'll call H for story purposes, who was 13 and in 8th grade at the time, tells me that at one point of the night, he woke up and my tongue was in his mouth. I was shocked to hear this as I didn't have any memory of making out with a sleeping person, but my memory from the night is blurry considering the alcohol. What I do remember is making out with a different boy, T \[15m at the time\], in a dark room in my friend's basement at one point of the night (this was fully consensual). I have a vague memory of kissing who I thought was T at one point, and him not kissing back, and feeling rejected/confused by this. I honestly have no idea what I did in response to this, but I'm pretty sure I just stopped kissing him. Around six months after that incident, one of H's friends \[14m at the time\] commented that I ""r\* ped"" H under one of my friend's instagram pictures of us.Both immediately after, and years later, I would ruminate about the incident all the time, wonder if it really happened/the severity, if I had traumatized H for his entire life. I would try to remember the incident but come up blank. 6 years after the incident, I reached out to H to get some clarity and apologize. He said that from what he remembers of the night, we were in a dark room and he was high and tired and I seemed pretty drunk and I kissed him. He said that he was young and kind of scared/confused by it bc he hadn't had experience kissing girls before, but that he never saw it as that big of a deal since it was just a kiss. I apologized and explained that I think what happened was that I mistook him for T in that dark room.

I don't know what to do - this haunts me everyday and I spend hours ruminating about it. I feel like I should be in jail or de \*ad. I have a good job and friends, none of which I feel like I deserve. People tell me its okay because this incident was most likely an accident. But since I can't remember this, I really have no way to prove if it was an accident or not."	16a4a2b	i assaulted someone  years ago as a teenager  unbearable guilt	"when i  f was  and in my freshman year of high school i went to a party at my friends house where we all were drinking in the morning as my friends and i were retelling what we remembered from the night this boy who ill call h for story purposes who was  and in th grade at the time tells me that at one point of the night he woke up and my tongue was in his mouth i was shocked to hear this as i didnt have any memory of making out with a sleeping person but my memory from the night is blurry considering the alcohol what i do remember is making out with a different boy t m at the time in a dark room in my friends basement at one point of the night this was fully consensual i have a vague memory of kissing who i thought was t at one point and him not kissing back and feeling rejectedconfused by this i honestly have no idea what i did in response to this but im pretty sure i just stopped kissing him around six months after that incident one of hs friends m at the time commented that i r ped h under one of my friends instagram pictures of usboth immediately after and years later i would ruminate about the incident all the time wonder if it really happenedthe severity if i had traumatized h for his entire life i would try to remember the incident but come up blank  years after the incident i reached out to h to get some clarity and apologize he said that from what he remembers of the night we were in a dark room and he was high and tired and i seemed pretty drunk and i kissed him he said that he was young and kind of scaredconfused by it bc he hadnt had experience kissing girls before but that he never saw it as that big of a deal since it was just a kiss i apologized and explained that i think what happened was that i mistook him for t in that dark room

806	I steal, guilt trip and lie a lot, and I dont know how to stop.	"I have absolutely no idea what it wrong with me, Im so ashamed to post this and Im starting to hate myself even more because of this. This was my last resort as I genuinely do not know how to stop. I wasn't sure where to post this but I'm sure it has something to do with my depression, anxiety, adhd or low self esteem or all of them I really do not know.

I am going to be completely honest this whole post. No lies.

Ever since late 2021 when I moved into my new neighborhood I started to steal from cornerstore, it wasnt that often for a while and it would usually be a candy bar or something stupid, even now the last time I stole from a cornerstore was probably a week ago Im guessing. In early 2022 I began to start stealing mary jane from my mom after my siblings introduced it to me a month or so before (i dont know if Im allowed to say it or not but im just gonna call it W), I still to this day do not know why I do it, but being honest I have not taken anything from her in 3 weeks Im also guessing, (I know that's absolutely fucking awful and I agree) as ive already wroten out a long oath saying im going to try my absolute hardest not to. (I know this is also awful) It wasnt long before I started to steal my sisters too, sometimes I just beg mysef that they will get a box with a lock on it to stop my dumbass from taking it, why? Because i genuinely do not know why i do. I got so hooked on it and now Im finally starting to control myself and making a decision to either get it from friends or someone else. I have stolen money multiple times too, from most of my family and I had one of their cards on my phone, which i recently deleted all traces of it from my phone
I recently got caught lying with my best friend, after it cooled down she started telling me how i lie a lot, how ill lie to peoples face and act stupid, how ive taken her W a couple times and lie about it to her face, which it true. She said she didnt care, and still wanted to be my friend. i kept telling her she could leave if she wanted, which doing that alone made me feel like a guilt tripper. The whole wntire co versation made me feel like a guilt tripper because i wouldnt stop cryng (ive alwyas been so sensitive its insane), i kept telling her i dont care if she leaves , which was a complete lie because im too attached to her because no one else wants to hang out with me like she does, and without her i cry a lot because my life is so boring and depressing when im alone.
 I often think im guilt tripping people but thinking im guilt tripping peopel makes me feel like a guilt tripper thinking that and it turns into a loop. 
Ive caused so many fights, so many problems in my house when my sister would go around asking who took it and i would lie and she would start getting mad at everyone and would eventually get yelled at by my parents which i can not fathom how bad i ceel for her, and the fact its all my fault too makes it even worse.
I dont like liars most of the time, no one likes liars even liars. I dont want to be known as a guilt tripper, as a thief, as a selfish person. This isnt me and i dont want it to be, i just dont know how to stop.

""People who lie pathologically may want others to view them positively, making things up to make them look better. Their desire to create a false sense of self could indicate that they are unhappy with themselves.""

I found this in a random article but i feel like it explained me, because i am unhappy with myself.

I am admitting i have a problem. I have a problem with guilt tripping i have a problem with lying and i have a problem with stealing. I want to get help and im admitting i need help. my next therapy session im going to bring this up to her.

I know some poeple are gonna be saying that a lot fo this could get me in illegal trouble, which ive been thinking about forver, which is one of the reason im trying to stop.

I dont think I could have said any of this in real life, especially to my sister or mother. I guess its easier when your telling a bunch of strangers.

Edit: Some people are saying im showing signs of being a manipulative and selfish person, or i feel bad for myself instead of others and im trying to get people to feel abd for me. A little more background since this story was rushed through a 2 year period - Most of the time i try to shut myself out as much as possible, ive always been the most sensitive person ever since i was a kid so most of the time ill easily cry if someone raises their voice at me or something like that. I hate bringing attention on myself and whenever my brother or someone else defends me i feel like the shittiest person and i get this depressed feeling in my body, getting attention doesnt bring me joy or satisfaction 90% of the time. Reading all these comments now have me thinking that im not even aware of my actions and what i really wnat people to think about me, and now im scared because i want to be in control of my thoughts and decisions."	169bkqh	i steal guilt trip and lie a lot and i dont know how to stop	"i have absolutely no idea what it wrong with me im so ashamed to post this and im starting to hate myself even more because of this this was my last resort as i genuinely do not know how to stop i wasnt sure where to post this but im sure it has something to do with my depression anxiety adhd or low self esteem or all of them i really do not know

807	I lied about the double chocolate chunk cookies. 🍪	One time I had cooked, and after my parents made cookies. I didn’t know they were making cookies and I thought I forgot to turn the oven off.

808	I must confess : I was never caught stealing from my aunt	Whenever I was a child my aunt lived with me and my family. My parents were very strict and had designated eating times .

810	I once stole someone’s place in line in a DMV and got in and out in 5 minutes	I needed new tags for my car and I’ve never gone to the DMV by myself before. I assumed I could get a ticket at a kiosk or something but there were none. I went to the tellers to ask them how I would get a ticket to queue in line and walked up to a worker who was closest to me. Simultaneously she had called a ticket number and as I was standing in front of her she assumed I was next. She asked me what I needed help with so I told her and she did my tags in only 5 minutes and I was out. I didn’t actually realize what had happened until I turned around and the actual person who was next was standing right behind me. I felt bad but it was also really freakn cool that I just discovered this new hack! Glad at least that I could be the first person to say they had a delightful DMV experience!	1684gf3	i once stole someones place in line in a dmv and got in and out in  minutes	i needed new tags for my car and ive never gone to the dmv by myself before i assumed i could get a ticket at a kiosk or something but there were none i went to the tellers to ask them how i would get a ticket to queue in line and walked up to a worker who was closest to me simultaneously she had called a ticket number and as i was standing in front of her she assumed i was next she asked me what i needed help with so i told her and she did my tags in only  minutes and i was out i didnt actually realize what had happened until i turned around and the actual person who was next was standing right behind me i felt bad but it was also really freakn cool that i just discovered this new hack glad at least that i could be the first person to say they had a delightful dmv experience	gf
811	I used to steal drinks from the cafeteria in middle school but in a sort of unique way	I would go get my lunch as usual and when I got to the register, you would tell the lunch lady to add items to the balance such as drinks, ice cream, hot pretzels, etc that weren’t at the main lunch line and then you’d get them or they’d give them to you. I would let them know at the start that I wanted a drink as well and I’d get a drink from the fridge behind them. One day I must’ve forgot to tell them to add a drink to the balance, but I still went and got a drink anyway because I thought I told them. I realized later on that they didn’t care at all if you took a drink without telling them to add it because the fridge was behind them and they couldn’t see it. so I just did this and got free drinks every single time, all 3 years of middle school and they never noticed. I didn’t try this with other items such as ice cream because the cooler was right in front of them so they could see if someone was stealing from it.	167m7fl	i used to steal drinks from the cafeteria in middle school but in a sort of unique way	i would go get my lunch as usual and when i got to the register you would tell the lunch lady to add items to the balance such as drinks ice cream hot pretzels etc that werent at the main lunch line and then youd get them or theyd give them to you i would let them know at the start that i wanted a drink as well and id get a drink from the fridge behind them one day i mustve forgot to tell them to add a drink to the balance but i still went and got a drink anyway because i thought i told them i realized later on that they didnt care at all if you took a drink without telling them to add it because the fridge was behind them and they couldnt see it so i just did this and got free drinks every single time all  years of middle school and they never noticed i didnt try this with other items such as ice cream because the cooler was right in front of them so they could see if someone was stealing from it	mfl
812	I lied and stole money from my parents, and it worsen overtime.	"So yes exactly like the title said...   
It started small. Like maybe around when I'm around 12 years old. I stole a little bit of money from my parents' drawer, which is the place where they tend to keep their stack of money. My parents were not too tech savvy so they tend to use cash and kept their money in a small vault or locked drawer. I stole like around 10 bucks and kept it for lunch money. My parents always give me lunch money but sometimes they forget, and I'm too scared to ask money from my parents. This was due to our financial situation at the time. So every talk regarding money was like walking in land mines. Anyway so over the years, our financial situation got pretty decent and it was easier to ask for pocket money. So i stopped stealing money. Until I started college.   
I attended an overseas university. At first things were great, until I started failing my classes. My grades went from 4.0 GPA to 3.5 and 3.0. And over the semester it just kept going down. I was struggling to maintain my studies and I was confused as to why I could not even get the words in. And  I started to play mobile games as a way to relieve my stress. The game I'm playing was Genshin Impact ( yes I know don attack me pls, blame my friend for forcing me to play this game with them). At first it does help with maintaining my stress but then I began to develop, you guessed it, gacha addiction. For those who are unfamiliar with the term, it is basically gambling. The game has a system where you can get rare limited characters with great fighting abilities and designs by rolling for them. However you don't necessarily guarantee to get them every time hence thats where the gambling comes in. In order for you to get guarantee to get the character, you have to pay real money. The game doesn't forced you to pay money, as long as you kept playing the missions daily. But I began to irresponsibly spend the money my parents send me for my rent and everyday necessities on it. I was addicted to the euphoria of getting the characters and collecting them. It was a distraction tactic to make me forget about my problems.   


I began to lie to my parents to get them to send more money to me, and even forged various documents and events like, ""oh my university was doing a seminar, can you send me $600 cus the entrance fee was expensive cus its a three day seminar!"" , ""Oh I need to renew my student visa, they need around $5000 for me to pay for everything! Oh the document of proof? Here it is!"". I even resort to forged my bank statements before I emailed it to them.   


And it continues on even when I have to return back to my country due to COVID. Everyday I stole around $100 more or less depending on how much I can get from their cash drawer. I lost count of how much I've stolen from them. Till this day, they never questioned why I spend so much money. They only told me that all these money is an investment for my future and its the parents responsibility to help their children. Because they thought I spend it on.... my studies.  


I was haunted with guilt and began hearing voices screaming how I am such a scornful child, worthless and disgusting. I even contemplate to jump off my apartment because I couldn't handle being the person I am. This also contributes even worse to my addiction and ever failing grades. I couldn't stop and kept stealing. At some point I did try to stopped playing the game however my compulsive spending is still there. I ended up using the money on something else, like buying expensive food, buying expensive skincare, purchasing random things on online shopping websites. Yesterday I downloaded Genshin again and spent even more on it.   


I finally visited a therapist because my university called me due to my failing grades and advised me to get professional help. However till this day I never told my parents about what I did.   


Mom Dad I'm so sorry.

i attended an overseas university at first things were great until i started failing my classes my grades went from  gpa to  and  and over the semester it just kept going down i was struggling to maintain my studies and i was confused as to why i could not even get the words in and  i started to play mobile games as a way to relieve my stress the game im playing was genshin impact  yes i know don attack me pls blame my friend for forcing me to play this game with them at first it does help with maintaining my stress but then i began to develop you guessed it gacha addiction for those who are unfamiliar with the term it is basically gambling the game has a system where you can get rare limited characters with great fighting abilities and designs by rolling for them however you dont necessarily guarantee to get them every time hence thats where the gambling comes in in order for you to get guarantee to get the character you have to pay real money the game doesnt forced you to pay money as long as you kept playing the missions daily but i began to irresponsibly spend the money my parents send me for my rent and everyday necessities on it i was addicted to the euphoria of getting the characters and collecting them it was a distraction tactic to make me forget about my problems   


i began to lie to my parents to get them to send more money to me and even forged various documents and events like oh my university was doing a seminar can you send me  cus the entrance fee was expensive cus its a three day seminar  oh i need to renew my student visa they need around  for me to pay for everything oh the document of proof here it is i even resort to forged my bank statements before i emailed it to them   


and it continues on even when i have to return back to my country due to covid everyday i stole around  more or less depending on how much i can get from their cash drawer i lost count of how much ive stolen from them till this day they never questioned why i spend so much money they only told me that all these money is an investment for my future and its the parents responsibility to help their children because they thought i spend it on my studies  


i was haunted with guilt and began hearing voices screaming how i am such a scornful child worthless and disgusting i even contemplate to jump off my apartment because i couldnt handle being the person i am this also contributes even worse to my addiction and ever failing grades i couldnt stop and kept stealing at some point i did try to stopped playing the game however my compulsive spending is still there i ended up using the money on something else like buying expensive food buying expensive skincare purchasing random things on online shopping websites yesterday i downloaded genshin again and spent even more on it   


i finally visited a therapist because my university called me due to my failing grades and advised me to get professional help however till this day i never told my parents about what i did   


mom dad im so sorry

813	recently hit a car and made a minor scratch that's somewhat noticeable kinda hard to see if the sun isn't shining and it's been a day and the person still hasn't realized	I recently hit a car and made a minor scratch that's somewhat noticeable kinda hard to see if the sun isn't shining and it's been a day and the person still hasn't realized. Idk what to do. Should I just fess up before it's too late and I'm fucked or do I just wait it out and see what happens. I'm a minor and it was in my schools parking lot there are definitely cameras. The only reason I'm scared is case it was a small but deep scratch and could cost quiet a bit and my dad just bought me a $250 car battery. I know what's the right thing to do I just don't know if the scratch is so bad I need insurance involved I plan on getting a job and paying the girl for the scratch	165tnc0	recently hit a car and made a minor scratch thats somewhat noticeable kinda hard to see if the sun isnt shining and its been a day and the person still hasnt realized	i recently hit a car and made a minor scratch thats somewhat noticeable kinda hard to see if the sun isnt shining and its been a day and the person still hasnt realized idk what to do should i just fess up before its too late and im fucked or do i just wait it out and see what happens im a minor and it was in my schools parking lot there are definitely cameras the only reason im scared is case it was a small but deep scratch and could cost quiet a bit and my dad just bought me a  car battery i know whats the right thing to do i just dont know if the scratch is so bad i need insurance involved i plan on getting a job and paying the girl for the scratch	tnc
814	How I qualified for state finals by hiding in a bush.	"So, this story takes place around 6 years ago. I was in 2nd year of secondary school (Junior high to American readers), around 14 years old.

 I participated in cross country running annually not out of passion but to miss a day of school and get pocket money for the shop after. (Buying loose rollies off my brothers friend. ) The event was held every year at the same cross country grounds about a 20 minute bus from my school. 

The big day arrives, I’m wearing essential running clothes, full tracksuit, puffy Superdry jacket, (yes these were trendy back then) and my trusty air max 90s that would slide through mud had I actually of attempted the race. The day is wet, cold and miserable. I decide on the way there the last thing I want to be doing is running 5/6 kilometres in this horrific weather, then waiting for everyone else to finish, then sitting on a stuffy muddy bus shivering till I get home. No thanks. I had ran this course before ; and knew it was 2 laps of a loop, with a large forestry/bushy area in the centre. The race starts, I set off at a sprint, so I don’t alert my teacher to any potential fuckery, run about 200 metres down the track, check over my shoulder, no steward watching so I proceed to hit the smoothest swan dive ever attempted straight into this bush(everyone else thought I slipped and joined back after lol) . Got extremely wet, cold and muddy but was it worth it? Every day of the week. I gleefully watched everyone else (my friends included) suffer through the remainder of the race while I chilled thinking I was Lord Muck smoking a rollie in the forest. 

The only crack in my plan was I failed to realise these were the Leinster final qualifiers (State/Province). So I wait for the first group to come around and slink my way craftily into the back, I run about 40 metres to the finish line, looking like I had just ran the course due to my poor fitness, muddy clothes and not being able to run more then 10 meters without dying. My PE teacher is ecstatic, congratulating me on qualifying for Leinster’s. I can still hear him saying “and doing it in that big jacket Aswell!” I had to hide my shock in the moment, but I played it off all the while feeling incredibly bad for my teacher who had no idea of my ‘abilities’. The realisation of running an actual track, in front of a huge crowd, in Leinster finals finally dawned on me, and I proceeded to ‘tear my hamstring’ playing with my dog days later. Yes, the same dog eating everyone’s homework. 

The memory came to me today as I visited the place in which the course is located. I had to smile to myself upon remembering, and Mr Upton, if your ever out there reading this, my apologies.

815	When I was younger, I stole a lot of bread from the neighbor	In my house my mother did not buy us bread and since we were little we liked to eat it a lot, so the neighbor was dedicated to selling bread, he had a small business, so I went into his house when he was not there and stole many breads The first time I did it I was very scared, I climbed through the door and there was a crack and I went in there, I uncovered the box of breads and grabbed what I could and I left through the same place, the second time I invited my sister more minor to help me steal more loaves, I told her and she did not want to but I convinced her, I told her that she was not going to go into the house, only me and she were going to wait for the loaves from outside, and we did so That time we took out a lot of loaves and we were very happy, but we never realized that there were traces on the floor, because it was dirt and it was wet, so the neighbors went to ask my mom if she didn't know who was stealing loaves from her to the neighbor, she said she didn't know anything, and it was true, my mom didn't know, but she told us, me and my younger sister were very scared, in the end I think the neighbors were suspicious because I had a shoe and the prints they found there were identical to those on my shoes, but they were only suspicions, to date it is not clearly known that we were the ones who went into the neighbor's house to take the loaves, now I remember everything I did Being younger, and I still know that's wrong, but we did it because mom never bought us the things we wanted and we could only get things and be happy with my brothers.	164aakp	when i was younger i stole a lot of bread from the neighbor	in my house my mother did not buy us bread and since we were little we liked to eat it a lot so the neighbor was dedicated to selling bread he had a small business so i went into his house when he was not there and stole many breads the first time i did it i was very scared i climbed through the door and there was a crack and i went in there i uncovered the box of breads and grabbed what i could and i left through the same place the second time i invited my sister more minor to help me steal more loaves i told her and she did not want to but i convinced her i told her that she was not going to go into the house only me and she were going to wait for the loaves from outside and we did so that time we took out a lot of loaves and we were very happy but we never realized that there were traces on the floor because it was dirt and it was wet so the neighbors went to ask my mom if she didnt know who was stealing loaves from her to the neighbor she said she didnt know anything and it was true my mom didnt know but she told us me and my younger sister were very scared in the end i think the neighbors were suspicious because i had a shoe and the prints they found there were identical to those on my shoes but they were only suspicions to date it is not clearly known that we were the ones who went into the neighbors house to take the loaves now i remember everything i did being younger and i still know thats wrong but we did it because mom never bought us the things we wanted and we could only get things and be happy with my brothers	aakp
816	My mom took 50 dollars from me, so I lied and told her I didn't know where her 200 dollars went.	"Me and my mother have an up and down relationship. Sometimes we'll be best friends, the next she'll wish I was never born; a burden to her.
It was my payday. As soon as I got home, she demanded 50 dollars from me. I had just given her 150 two days prior. I knew what it was for. She wanted to gamble or she was giving it to my stepdad so he could gamble. No matter how many times I told her no, she would get louder and louder and threaten me more, so I just gave in. She wasn't gonna pay me back; she never does, but what could I do? 

A few days later, me and her were talking in her room. When she got up to leave, I saw it; 200 dollars dropping from her wallet. When I saw it, I didn't know what got ahold of me. This felt like my way of getting revenge, being able to pay myself back kinda. I quickly pocket the money and went on my way. A few hours later, my mom called in a frantic asking if I'd seen 200 dollars around the house. I told her no straight to her face and hung up.
To this day, she still doesn't know. I hated stealing and lying to my mother's face, but I also still feel it was deserved after years of her taking from me. I've been living with this guilt for about a month now and it eats me alive everyday and keeps me awake at night. I'm sorry mom.

Edit: Man. Every single ones of y'alls comments make me smile and tear up. I wish I can thank you all personally for all the advice I've been given and the feedback. Even though I still feel guilty, I feel a lot better knowing I'm somewhat reasonable for my doings. For those with similar stories to share, I also feel deeply for you. You've all help me a lot!

817	I made up a book out of my imagination to write a book report	I was getting to the point where school work was beginning to seem incredibly pointless to me and so I decided one time to just make up a book and write my book report based on whatever came to my mind. Made up the title and the author and the plot and the lessons to be learned from it and everything. Never got called out on it for some reason. The funny thing is I was a voracious reader at the time and could have picked any of the multiple books I had finished reading recently but it just seemed more fun to do it this way.	1637qoa	i made up a book out of my imagination to write a book report	i was getting to the point where school work was beginning to seem incredibly pointless to me and so i decided one time to just make up a book and write my book report based on whatever came to my mind made up the title and the author and the plot and the lessons to be learned from it and everything never got called out on it for some reason the funny thing is i was a voracious reader at the time and could have picked any of the multiple books i had finished reading recently but it just seemed more fun to do it this way	qoa
818	I throw out my roomates dishes when she leaves them for me to clean	my roommate and i have been living together for like six years now, we were really close friends as teenagers and continued to be into adulthood. our personalities work really well together but as we’ve gotten older she’s become pretty lazy and stopped doing any housework at all whatsoever. when we moved into our most recent apartment, i suggested that we get paper utensils and plates since we both work a lot and i didn’t want the workload of the apartment to get to be too much for “us” (i really meant me, as i’m the only one doing ANYTHING.) she didn’t listen and insisted on buying this set of like 200 dollar plates/bowls. Long story short, whenever she leaves her dirty dishes in the sink for longer than two days, i just throw them in the dumpster. i am not being a maid to a grown ass woman especially considering i work more than her. i will not be renewing this lease but i do feel kind of bad that good quality dishes are getting thrown out.	16334ob	i throw out my roomates dishes when she leaves them for me to clean	my roommate and i have been living together for like six years now we were really close friends as teenagers and continued to be into adulthood our personalities work really well together but as weve gotten older shes become pretty lazy and stopped doing any housework at all whatsoever when we moved into our most recent apartment i suggested that we get paper utensils and plates since we both work a lot and i didnt want the workload of the apartment to get to be too much for us i really meant me as im the only one doing anything she didnt listen and insisted on buying this set of like  dollar platesbowls long story short whenever she leaves her dirty dishes in the sink for longer than two days i just throw them in the dumpster i am not being a maid to a grown ass woman especially considering i work more than her i will not be renewing this lease but i do feel kind of bad that good quality dishes are getting thrown out	ob
819	I copied an episode of a tv show for a writing competition	"I was in primary school at the time, must have been around 9 or 10 and we had a competition to write a short story. We had one class to complete the task. 

I've always loved writing, had a way with words and have always dreamed of becoming a writer (never worked out like that) anyway... I probably had my first case of writers block, nothing came to mind and I furiously started writing nonsense on the page, scribbling it out again and again... then I remembered something, I had recently watched a new episode of Goosebumps. So I wrote it down. The entire episode from what I could remember. A goddamn Goosebumps episode. 

A week or so later I had a dentist appointment and as I got back to school, a bunch of girls were telling me how the teacher was telling everyone that I was a truly gifted writer, that it was such a good story that I had won the 1st prize. I was congratulated in front of the school later that day for my creativity and skill.

I have such social anxiety and felt so bad that I accepted the award and acted grateful but inside I was full of guilt.

821	i (24 M) stole upwards of 500 pokemon cards from a 1st grader	"so this happened almost 8 years ago now. i (24 M) went to a K-12 private school for most of my life. when i was in 9th grade, my younger brother entered kindergarten. every day would walk down to the kindergarten room to pick up my brother and we would walk home together.

one day i was walking down to the kindergarten room, and during my walk i always pass the first grade room. they don't have lockers for kindergarten and first grade, just hooks in the hall outside the room to hang their coats/bags and a shelf just above to place their lunch boxes. this particular day i was walking down the hall, which was totally empty as i usually left my study hall a bit early to get to my brother's classroom before the halls are crowded, and i noticed as i passed the hooks and shelf outside the first grade room that there was a fairly large container with Pokémon cards inside on the shelf. 

for context of why i did this, i have been collecting Pokémon cards for years, but my family wasn't super rich or anything so i didn't have many in my collection compared to other kids i knew (maybe 200 cards of my own). i don't know what came over me but i took the container of cards. didn't even think twice about it. i stuffed it in my backpack and continued on with my day. frankly i had completely forgotten about it until recently and i just wanted to get it off my chest without having to tell someone i know and have them think that i'm a terrible person.

822	I lied on my resume and to my boss about my work history.	"So I’ve recently started my new job. It’s a at a Pawn Shop (let’s label it Pawn Shop A). But I feel so dirty… I feel like a criminal who has committed fraud. 

For a broader context, the past year I worked at a Pawn Shop in London, upon returning to my home town two months ago, I temporarily took up a part time job at a Pawn Shop (Call it Pawn Shop B) down the street from the one I’m currently working at. The thing is, in my CV I included that I worked at the one in London the past year but not that I had at the time been working at Pawn Shop B, as I had only been there a few works doing 18 hours a week. But in the interview I lied and said I didn’t work there, out of fear that I would get rejected. Either for it being a “conflict of interest” or just being rejected for leaving a place after only having been there for a month. So I’ve stated my new job at Pawn Shop A and literally nobody has any idea that just a few weeks ago I worked at Pawn Shop B down the street. 

I just feel like such a rotten horrible person, I feel so guilty… Like a no good criminal. And fuck am I scared of what legal action would get taken against me if they found out. 

*For context, i took on the new job at Pawn Shop A because the hours are very good, it’s full time 45 hours a week. I had no malicious intent, I’m just trying to do better to support myself and my girlfriend.

823	I found cash in my buddy's laundry while housesitting and have been spending it on amenities for his house	Title says it all. I found cash, probably at least $60, in my buddy's laundry while housesitting for him. Originally I left it in with his clean clothes for him to find later, but after a couple days I started noticing things around the house that needed replacing or would be helpful for him to have, so I've slowly been spending his cash on cleaning and pet supplies. But I feel guilty because I feel like it's a total control freak move to be deciding how to spend his forgotten money, so maybe I'll replace it before he gets back LOL.	15zmz3n	i found cash in my buddys laundry while housesitting and have been spending it on amenities for his house	title says it all i found cash probably at least  in my buddys laundry while housesitting for him originally i left it in with his clean clothes for him to find later but after a couple days i started noticing things around the house that needed replacing or would be helpful for him to have so ive slowly been spending his cash on cleaning and pet supplies but i feel guilty because i feel like its a total control freak move to be deciding how to spend his forgotten money so maybe ill replace it before he gets back lol	zmzn
